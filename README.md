# Lab NLP in Finance

This GitHub repository showcases the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in finance through sentiment analysis. The project consists of two notebooks. 

* **Notebook 1**: A web scraping function is provided to collect company news from Investing.com. Prior to usage, users need to download a webdriver, with instructions available in the notebook.

* **Notebook 2**: Demonstrates the implementation of NLP in finance. It begins with cleaning the collected articles followed by sentiment analysis. The sentiment scores, along with other predictors, are utilized to predict stock movements (increase or decrease) employing various machine learning classification methods including:
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Linear Discriminant Analysis
  3. Naive Bayes
  4. Support Vector Machines
  5. KNN Classification
  6. Random Forest
  7. Single Layer Neural Networks.

Explore how NLP techniques can be leveraged for sentiment analysis in financial contexts and prediction of stock movements using machine learning algorithms.
