By Ron Bousso

LONDON (Reuters) -Shell is set to conclude nearly a century of operations in Nigerian onshore oil and gas after agreeing to sell its subsidiary there to a consortium of five mostly local companies for up to $2.4 billion.

The British energy giant pioneered Nigeria's oil and gas business beginning in the 1930s. It has struggled for years with hundreds of onshore oil spills as a result of theft, sabotage and operational issues that led to costly repairs and high-profile lawsuits.

Since 2021, Shell (LON: ) has sought to sell its Nigerian oil and gas business, but will remain active in Nigeria's more lucrative and less problematic offshore sector.

Shell's exit is part of a broader retreat by western energy companies from Nigeria as they focus on newer, more profitable operations. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), Italy's Eni and Norway's Equinor have struck deals to sell assets in the country in recent years.

The British major will sell The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) for a consideration of $1.3 billion, it said in a statement, while the buyers will make an additional payment of up to $1.1 billion relating to prior receivables at completion.

""This agreement marks an important milestone for Shell in Nigeria, aligning with our previously announced intent to exit onshore oil production in the Niger Delta, simplifying our portfolio and focusing future disciplined investment in Nigeria on our Deepwater and Integrated Gas positions,"" Shell head of upstream Zoë Yujnovich said.

The buyer, the Renaissance consortium comprises ND Western, Aradel Energy, First E&P, Waltersmith, all local oil exploration and production companies, and Petrolin, a Swiss-based trading and investment company.

The sale, which Renaissance confirmed, requires the approval of the Nigerian government.

SPILLS AND LAWSUITS

Renaissance will take over the responsibility for dealing with spills, theft and sabotage, said Shell, which has faced in recent years multiple lawsuits for compensation over damage caused as a result of spills in the Niger delta.

Nnimmo Bassey, Executive Director of Nigerian advocacy group Health of Mother Earth Foundation said: ""Shell must own up to its responsibility.""

""This means full payment for the remediation and restoration of the polluted areas as well as reparations to the host communities. They cannot walk away from the virtually irreparable harm they have caused,"" Bassey said in a statement.

Shell's SPDC Limited operates and has a 30% stake in the SPDC joint venture that holds 18 onshore and shallow water mining leases. Shell's resources in SPDC reached around 458 million barrels of oil equivalent by the end of 2022.

Other partners in the joint venture are the state's Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which holds 55%, TotalEnergies (LON: ), with 10% and Italy's Eni with 5%.

Apart from its operations and stakes in several fields deep offshore, Shell still has a liquefied plant and other assets in Nigeria.

SPDC, which remains the operator, was formed in 1979, incorporating assets of the older Shell-BP consortium, with its current partners entering at later stages.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/shell-agrees-to-sell-its-nigeria-onshore-oil-and-gas-business-3298980,0.078,0.843,0.079,-0.2073

Inflation remains above the central bank’s 2% target, but has dropped sharply from the 41-year high of 11.1% seen in October 2022, and thus policymakers could use this occasion to suggest that they are tentatively moving towards cutting interest rates.

The kept interest rates unchanged late Wednesday, but Chairman downplayed any hopes of early cuts, saying inflation is still running above the Fed's target and this would likely prevent policymakers from lowering rates at its next meeting in March.

Job vacancies drop in December - Adzuma

Job vacancies in the UK fell by the most in more than three years in December, according to new figures.

The data is another sign that resilient labour market is cooling amid .

Figures in the latest Job Market Report published by online portal Adzuna showed advertised vacancies dropped 6.95% in December, the largest drop since June 2020.

Oil majors keeps London in the green

The FTSE 100 is in positive territory, although early highs.

Russ Mould at AJ Bell notes a ""strong showing from heavyweight oil stocks has helped make up for weakness elsewhere.”

“Oil prices advanced thanks to a renewed escalation in Middle East tensions, with a further attack on shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels and three US soldiers killed in a drone attack on a US service base on the border of Jordan and Syria,"" he explained.

Howeverm he pointed out that crude hitting its highest level since November ""feels ominous given it adds inflationary pressure at a time when borrowers and the markets are hoping to see interest rates cut.""

""Geopolitical factors seem to be propping up oil at a time when the wider dynamics of supply and demand look less than favourable for the energy market,"" he added.

Proactive Investors - Rachel Reeves, the Labour shadow chancellor, declared she and her party will ""unashamedly champion"" the UK's financial services sector.

Ahead of a general election this year, her comments mark a pivot from Labour's previously strained interactions with the financial industry in past leaderships.

Heavily influenced by advice from City veterans, Labour seeks to streamline regulation, leverage technological advancements like artificial intelligence (AI), and solidify the UK's position on the global financial stage.

Reeves is set to launch Labour’s plans for the City and financial services on Thursday at a business event expected to be attended by leaders from companies such as AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ) and Shell (LON: ).

Notably, the strategy stops short of proposing any drastic political changes, reflecting an understanding of the sector's desire for stability post-Brexit.

“The last thing we need is a massive upheaval,” said a Reeves supporter. “Rachel recognises that stability and security are needed.”

Under the plans, Labour would welcome Conservative changes such as Jeremy Hunt’s Edinburgh reforms and the changes to the Solvency II regime.

“Too often in the last decade, British politicians have sounded embarrassed about the sectors we excel in… That will change with Labour,” Reeves said.

Additionally, the plans will tackle regulating 'buy now pay later' (BNPL) schemes, a review of City regulation, building relationships with the EU and the rollout of ‘banking hubs’ for free access to financial services, according to reports.

Sharecast - The was steady at 7,684.18.

Investors were mulling the released overnight. They showed that officials saw rate cuts as likely this year but didn't give any details on when the central bank might start to loosen monetary policy.

Market participants were also digesting the latest data out of China, where the rose to 52.9 in December from 51.5 in November. This was above consensus expectations of 51.6 and marked the highest level since July. A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, while a reading below signals contraction.

Overall new orders rose 2.5 points to 53.7 - the highest since May - while the index for new export orders was up 0.7 points to 52.2.

On home shores, a survey out earlier showed that activity in the UK service sector rose at the fastest pace in six months in December.

The S&P Global/CIPS business activity index increased to 53.4 from 50.9 in December, coming in above the flash reading of 52.7.

Meanwhile, the final - which measures activity in both the service and manufacturing sector - came in at 52.1 in December, up from 50.7 the month before. This also marked the highest level since last June and was above the flash estimate of 51.7.

Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""December data indicated that the UK service sector ended last year on a high, with business activity growth accelerating to its fastest for six months as the turnaround in order books gained momentum. The recovery in client demand was attributed to hopes of lower borrowing costs and an improving global economic backdrop in 2024. However, many firms continued to cite challenging underlying business conditions due to the stagnating UK economy and strong pressure on margins from rising labour costs.

""Business activity expectations for the year ahead are now the most upbeat since last May, supported by signs of a rebound in clients' appetite to spend. Staff hiring was the main weak spot in December, with hiring freezes yet to be lifted as service providers sought to maintain a tight grip on headcount.""

Separate data released by the Bank of England showed that mortgage approvals rose more than expected in November, to their highest in five months as interest rate projections began to fall.

Net approvals for house purchases, a key indicator of future borrowing, totalled 50,100 in November, up from 47,900 in October and the highest level since June. This was ahead of the consensus estimate of 48,500.

Meanwhile, net approvals for remortgaging, which only include remortgaging with a different lender, increased from 24,000 to 27,000.

In equity markets, fashion retailer Next (LON: ) rallied as it lifted annual guidance after better-than-expected full-price sales during November and December. Full-price sales in the nine weeks to December 30 rose 5.7% year-on-year, £38m better than previous guidance of a 2% rise.

Annual pre-tax profit was lifted £20m to £905m. Of that, £17m came from the sales beat to date and £3m from an upgraded forecast for full-price sales in January.

Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""In all, Next has shown its mettle once more in a famously competitive environment, in which it is seen as something of a linchpin. Its share price performance has also defied the odds which tend to follow the retail sector, having risen by 35% over the last year, as compared to a gain of just 1.3% for the wider FTSE 100.

""The warm initial price reaction to the update could initiate some upgrades to a market consensus which has yet to break out of its range for a sustained period of time. Indeed, the general view of the shares as a hold, albeit a strong one, has tended to underestimate the strides which the company has been making.""

BP (LON: ) and Shell (LON: ) gushed higher as oil prices rose amid growing tensions in the Middle East.

Going the other way, JD Sports (LON: ) tumbled as it delivered a profit warning after second-half trading missed expectations due to milder autumn weather and heavier discounting over the peak holiday shopping season.

The company said the ""elevated level of promotional activity"" during the peak trading period meant that full-year gross margins would be slightly lower than last year, leading it to cut adjusted pre-tax profit guidance to between £915m and £935m, from £1.04bn at the half-year stage.

Sports Direct (LON: ) owner Frasers Group also lost ground.

Tullow Oil (LON: ) was on the back foot after a downgrade to ‘underperform’ from ‘hold’ at Jefferies.

Big Yellow, Dr Martens (LON: ) and Workspace (LON: ) were in the red as they traded without entitlement to the dividend.

West End landlord Shaftesbury Capital was also in the black as it hailed a ""strong"" start to the Christmas trading, with footfall high and sales tracking above the prior year. The company said customers reported sales up 12% on 2022 levels and 16% above 2019 levels.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Shell (LON: ) Plc has made a final investment decision to build a gas supply facility in Nigeria to feed a fertiliser plant owned by Africa's richest man Aliko Dangote, the company said in a statement.

The new facility will supply 100 million standard cubic feet of gas per day from the Iseni field to the Dangote Fertiliser and Petrochemical plant for 10 years, according to the deal agreed by Shell and its joint venture partners TotalEnergies (LON: ), Eni and the state oil firm NNPC Ltd.

The $2.5 billion plant, Africa's largest urea complex with a 3-million-tonne output per year, accounts for 65% of Nigeria's fertiliser needs and can supply all the major markets in the sub-region.

""The agreement is a critical step in pursuing the development of the gas-rich Iseni field, which is part of the Okpokunou Cluster in Oil Mining Lease 35"" in the oil-rich Bayelsa state, Shell's Nigeria chief, Osagie Okunbor, said in an email.

Nigeria holds Africa's largest gas reserves of more than 200 trillion cubic feet and is seeking to develop the reserves to boost supply to industries, power plants, and for exports.

Okunbor said the project will increase the delivery of gas to the domestic market and help stimulate economic growth.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-agrees-to-develop-nigeria-gas-field-for-dangote-fertiliser-3323200,0.009,0.91,0.081,0.9485

LONDON (Reuters) - Amsterdam-listed shares in energy company Shell (LON: ) hit their highest in over two decades in early trading on Wednesday.

At 0718 GMT the shares were 0.7% higher, having earlier risen as much as 1.2% to 31.62 euros ($33.54), their highest level since late 2001. Shell's London-listed shares were up 0.7% on the day, having hit their highest since mid-2019 earlier in the day.

The oil price, which surged by the most in one day since April on Monday after fighting erupted in Israel, has risen 2.5% so far this year, but at around $88 a barrel, is not far off its highest in 11 months.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Sixty percent of British firms feel that a slowing Chinese economy presents a bigger challenge to their operations in the Asian giant than strict COVID curbs in place until late last year, according to the British Chamber of Commerce in China.

While the ""peak pessimism"" recorded during the pandemic is easing, British businesses are delaying making new investment in China amid a stuttering economic recovery and are downgrading the importance of the world's No. 2 economy to their global operations, the chamber's annual sentiment survey released on Tuesday showed.

Foreign investors have been sour on China for most of this year due to factors such as a weaker-than-expected post-pandemic recovery, a series of office raids by Chinese authorities, cash-strapped local governments offering fewer investment incentives and higher investment yields in the United States.

""In previous years, 80% (of firms) were investing more because of market potential, but it feels like we're now entering a phase of real clarity,"" Julian Fisher, the chamber's chair said.

""(Firms) are a lot more pragmatic and there's a lot less speculation,"" he added.

AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ), BP (LON: ), Jaguar Land Rover and Shell (LON: ) are some of the chamber's members.

The chamber's findings, based on members' views over October and November, revealed that 60% of companies felt that doing business in China had become more difficult over the past year, with 78% of such firms blaming economic factors.

""(British) companies in China are effectively treading water, with many delaying key decisions around investment and market entry,"" the report read.

Over half the companies surveyed said geopolitics was also making it harder to operate in China, while 43% of firms were struggling with regulatory issues such as licence acquisition.

Foreign direct investment into China has slowed substantially since the country abandoned its strict COVID-19 curbs late last year, leading the country to record its first-ever quarterly deficit in foreign direct investment over July-September, suggesting capital outflow pressure.

The chamber said that while ""British businesses are experiencing a slow return in optimism,"" a trend in which firms are downgrading China's importance to their global operations ""appears to be stabilising.""

Just under half of the surveyed companies listed China as a ""medium priority"" or ""low priority,"" with only 40% of firms recording it as a ""high priority."" In comparison, fifty nine percent of companies saw China as a ""high priority"" over 2021-2022.

Trade between the UK and China was worth 111 billion pounds ($140 billion) last year, according to the British National Bureau of Statistics, making China the UK's fourth largest trading partner.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/uk-companies-pause-china-investment-decisions-as-economy-slows-survey-shows-3266316,0.06,0.899,0.042,-0.9009

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Shell is considering a sale of its Singapore refining and petrochemical plants as part of a broader strategic review and has hired investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) to explore a potential deal, said several sources close to the matter.

The global energy major's new CEO, Wael Sawan, is targeting spending cuts over the next two years to boost profitability while remaining committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.

Those efforts include the review of energy and chemicals assets on Singapore's Bukom and Jurong islands, announced in June, as the group seeks to repurpose its energy and chemical parks globally to offer more low-carbon solutions to customers.

""Our strategic review is ongoing and we are exploring several options including divestment,"" a Shell (LON: ) spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday.

Singapore's position as a regional trading and marketing hub remains important, she added.

Companies that are reviewing Shell's Singapore assets include Asia's largest refiner, China's Sinopec, as well as global trading companies Vitol and Trafigura, the sources said.

For trading companies, the site is seen as a potential oil storage and distribution hub, some of the sources said.

Goldman Sachs, Sinopec, Trafigura and Vitol declined to comment.

The Bukom refinery, Shell's only wholly owned refining and petrochemicals centre in Asia, can process 237,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude. Built in 1961, it was Singapore's first refinery.

The complex also houses a 1 million metric tons per year (tpy) ethylene cracker and a 155,000 tpy butadiene extraction unit. These are integrated with a monoethylene glycol (MEG) plant at Shell’s petrochemicals site on Jurong Island.

In March, Shell decided not to proceed with two projects it was studying to produce biofuels and base oils in Singapore.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/exclusiveshell-taps-goldman-sachs-to-explore-singapore-refinery-sale-sources-3132312,0.016,0.915,0.069,0.9149

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shell (LON: ) and Trinidad and Tobago's National Gas Company (NGC) are close to agreeing to credit Venezuela's state-run oil firm for its $1 billion investment in a gas field the three want to jointly develop, four people close to the discussions said.

If agreed, the move could help speed a long-stalled offshore development. The U.S. in January granted Venezuela's PDVSA, Shell and NGC a two-year authorization to revive the project, which could boost Trinidad and Tobago's gas processing and exports.

Negotiations between the trio initially had progressed little over a U.S. demand that the proposed Dragon gas project exclude cash payments to Venezuela or its state companies. That remains a hurdle, though Trinidad has asked the Biden administration to reconsider.

Much of the $1 billion that Venezuela wants recognized as its contribution belongs to a nearly-completed gas line connecting the offshore field to Venezuela's shore, two of the people said. The field is in Venezuelan waters and past efforts to find partners for its development stumbled over PDVSA's demands for compensation.

Shell and NGC have not given final word to PDVSA on the reimbursement, but are prepared to pay for ""all legitimate claims,"" one of the sources said.

PDVSA in 2013 finished testing gas output at Dragon, whose reserves it estimated at 4.2 trillion cubic feet. But the field has never been commercially active due to Venezuela's lack of capital and, more recently, U.S sanctions.

Shell and NGC confirmed the parties are holding negotiations, but declined to elaborate.

""Discussions on the Dragon project involving the governments of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago and Shell are ongoing and commercially confidential,"" Shell told Reuters.

Trinidad's Energy Minister Stuart Young met Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro last week, the Venezuelan government said on social media.

PDVSA, Venezuela's oil ministry and Trinidad's energy ministry did not reply to requests for comment. The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson said its overall Venezuela sanctions policy remains in place to limit revenue flows to Maduro with the goal of ""encouraging a return to democracy in Venezuela.""

SHOW ME THE MONEY

Trinidad's Prime Minister Keith Rowley in January suggested it could pay for the gas in humanitarian goods, including food and medicine.

Venezuela, however, has insisted it will not accept any deal exclusively based on barter, the sources said.

""PDVSA has said they want part of the payment for the gas in cash and the other part in kind,"" a sources said.

In May, Trinidad's government asked U.S. officials to amend some license terms related to Dragon's expected proceeds.

But Washington has remained reluctant to consider any license changes until there is further progress in negotiations, another person said.

Under the terms agreed to date, Shell would become field operator with NGC and PDVSA holding equity stakes. PDVSA, which holds a license issued by Venezuela for development, would bring in Shell and NGC as partners under that authorization.

The parties are considering two separate gas lines: A line now partially built to transport PDVSA's portion of the gas to Guiria, on Venezuela's eastern coast. A second could connect to Shell's Hibiscus field on Trinidad's side, allowing gas to flow to Trinidad, the people said.

Venezuela also has suggested that all the gas pass through Guiria, so only an additional short pipeline would be needed to link Guiria to Point Fortin, home of Trinidad's liquefied export plants.

That option would allow PDVSA to transport and process the gas on Venezuela's shore, keeping what it needs to supply the domestic market and exporting gas liquids that could be produced in future project stages.

However, the other parties have not preferred that option, the people said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusiveshell-trinidad-weigh-venezuelas-natural-gas-investment-demands-3143828,0.024,0.905,0.071,0.9818

JPMorgan (NYSE: ) has recently upgraded its rating on global energy stocks from Neutral to Overweight, predicting a supply-demand gap after 2025 and improving sector fundamentals. The bank anticipates that major companies will outperform midcaps and has upgraded Eni to Overweight while maintaining Overweight on Shell (LON: ), TotalEnergies (EPA: ), and Neste. Repsol (OTC: ) was also lifted to Neutral.

Analysts led by Christyan Malek suggest the sector is experiencing a structural up-cycle, with oil prices and energy equities expected to fluctuate within a wider range. This reflects an effective higher weighted average cost of capital due to increased price volatility and concerns around environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues and peak demand.

The analysts argue against peak demand fears within their investment horizon through 2030, citing the immaturity of the clean energy system in catering to end customers effectively. They warn that without an increase in oil and gas capital expenditure (capex), there's a risk of energy deficits and significant inflation across commodities. This situation could potentially lead to severe oil-led energy crises this decade, which could be worse than Europe's gas crisis in 2022.

Interestingly, the analysts do not view oil prices in the $100-to-$120 range as destructive to demand, as it would still represent less than 4% of the world economy. They believe this situation could bolster OPEC's control over the global oil market and help regulate sharp price fluctuations.

Key stocks expected to outperform on a global scale include Eni, Shell, TotalEnergies, Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL: ), Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), Marathon Petroleum (NYSE: ), Tenaris, Baker Hughes, Cenovus, Prio, PetroChina, Beach Energy (OTC: ), and Ampol. Despite a 30% surge in oil prices recently, European energy stocks have only seen a 10% increase.

In other market movements, European stocks were adjusting to Wall Street's sharp decline on Thursday, with the U.K.'s remaining steady, while and 40 experienced decreases. Ubisoft Entertainment shares increased by 4% following provisional approval from the U.K. competition regulator for the Microsoft-Activision deal, which would grant the French video games maker cloud rights to Activision games.

Benzinga - by Benzinga Insights, Benzinga Staff Writer. Shell's (NYSE:SHEL) short percent of float has fallen 44.44% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 3.44 million shares sold short, which is 0.1% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 1.0 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Shell Short Interest Graph (3 Months)

As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Shell has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.

Comparing Shell's Short Interest Against Its Peers Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.

According to Benzinga Pro, Shell's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 1.69%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.

Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.

Investing.com -- Shell PLC's (AS: ) first quarter gas trading will resemble the posted in the final three months of 2022, the oil major said in an update on Thursday.

In the statement, Europe's biggest oil and gas company predicted that trading and optimization at its key integrated gas division would be ""at a similar level"" compared to the fourth quarter.

Shell also forecast that quarterly production at the unit would be in the range of 930,000 to 970,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from 917,000 in the prior three months.

Integrated gas, which includes the world's largest trading operations, reported $6 billion in adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter, thanks largely to soaring energy prices caused by the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.

Investing.com -- Shell PLC's (AS: ) first quarter gas trading will resemble the posted in the final three months of 2022, the oil major said in an update on Thursday.

In the statement, Europe's biggest oil and gas company predicted that trading and optimization at its key integrated gas division would be ""at a similar level"" compared to the fourth quarter.

Shell also forecast that quarterly production at the unit would be in the range of 930,000 to 970,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from 917,000 in the prior three months.

Integrated gas, which includes the world's largest trading operations, reported $6 billion in adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter, thanks largely to soaring energy prices caused by the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.

These prices have since moderated from the surges seen in 2022, although both and benchmarks have gained this week following a surprise decision by OPEC and its allies - including Russia - to slash output.

Analysts at RBC said the statement looked ""positive overall"" for Shell given concerns over the impact of weaker gas prices on the 115-year-old business.

LONDON (Reuters) -Shell said on Thursday it is seeking partners to invest in renewable assets developed and operated by its Indian business Sprng Energy as part of CEO Wael Sawan's effort to boost profits.

Sprng, which Shell (LON: ) acquired from Actis in August 2022 for $1.55 billion, develops and supplies solar and wind power to electricity distribution companies in India, seen as a major growth market in the power sector in the coming decades.

""We continue to develop new projects (of the Sprng Energy group) while exploring partnering opportunities with investors who want to deploy capital on de-risked operational assets, with Shell retaining a stake in such assets,"" Shell said in a statement to Reuters.

""This focus on capital discipline will enable Shell to further accelerate growth of our renewables portfolio.""

The move is part of Sawan's plan to boost Shell's performance and returns, which includes doubling down on oil and gas operations and scaling back some investments in renewables.

Shell has in recent months sold its UK power retail business, placed two refineries in Singapore and Germany under strategic review, and pulled out of several low-carbon projects.

Sawan's strategy has angered some climate-focused investors. Shell's head of renewable generation Thomas Brostrom left the company in June.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-seeks-partners-for-renewable-assets-in-india-3162759,0.012,0.896,0.092,0.9493

BERLIN (Reuters) - Oil and gas major Shell (LON: ) plans to put Germany's sonnen up for sale, German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Thursday, with the solar storage manufacturer saying it had no comment but was focused on pursuing global growth of its business.

Shell paid around 500 million euros ($536 million) for sonnen four years ago, but like its rivals has had to grapple with falling retail profit margins as wholesale energy prices have risen exceptionally following last year's supply crisis.

Last week, Shell said that it would sell its home energy retail business in the UK and Germany to British energy supplier Octopus Energy Group.

Handelsblatt's report cited several people familiar with the matter as saying sonnen could be valued at 1.35 to 1.8 billion euros, which is three to four times its expected 2023 sales of 450 million euros.

Spokespeople for Shell and sonnen declined to comment.

""Please understand that we will not comment on reports about Shell's business deals. In principle, sonnen is continuing its global growth course in the rapidly expanding storage market,"" a sonnen spokesperson said.

Sonnen, which provides storage batteries for rooftop solar systems, said last month that it has connected 25,000 homes to the grid, amassing 250 megawatt hours (MWh) of capacity in a latest milestone for the digital, renewable power community it is building up amongst its customers.

While 250 MWh is a tiny fraction of the power demand in Western countries, it puts sonnen in the top league of European electricity storage providers.

(Bloomberg) -- One morning in early June, a fire broke out at an obscure facility in Texas that takes from US shale basins, chills it into a liquid and ships it overseas. It was extinguished in 40 minutes or so. No one was injured.

It sounds like a story for the local press, at most — except that more than three weeks later, financial and political shockwaves are still reverberating across Europe, Asia and beyond.

That’s because natural gas is the hottest commodity in the world right now. It’s a key driver of global inflation, posting price jumps that are extreme even by the standards of today’s turbulent markets — some 700% in Europe since the start of last year, pushing the continent to the brink of recession. It’s at the heart of a dawning era of confrontation between the great powers, one so intense that in capitals across the West, plans to fight climate change are getting relegated to the back-burner.

In short, natural gas now rivals oil as the fuel that shapes geopolitics. And there isn’t enough of it to go around.

It’s the war in Ukraine that catalyzed the gas crisis to a new level, by taking out a crucial chunk of supply. Russia is cutting back on pipeline deliveries to Europe — which says it wants to stop buying from Moscow anyway, if not quite yet. The scramble to fill that gap is turning into a worldwide stampede, as countries race to secure scarce cargoes of liquefied natural gas ahead of the northern-hemisphere winter.

The New Oil?

Germany says gas shortfalls could trigger a Lehman Brothers-like collapse, as Europe’s economic powerhouse faces the unprecedented prospect of businesses and consumers running out of power. The main Nord Stream pipeline that carries Russian gas to Germany is due to shut down on July 11 for ten days of maintenance, and there’s growing fear that Moscow may not reopen it. Group of Seven leaders are seeking ways to curb Russia’s gas earnings, which help finance the invasion of Ukraine — and backing new LNG investments. And poorer countries that built energy systems around cheap gas are now struggling to afford it.

“This is the 1970s for natural gas,” says Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners LLC, a Washington-based research firm. “The world is now thinking about gas as it once thought about oil, and the essential role that gas plays in modern economies and the need for secure and diverse supply have become very visible.”

Natural gas used to be a sleepy commodity that changed hands in fragmented regional markets. Now, even though globalization appears to be in retreat across much of the world economy, the gas trade is headed in the opposite direction. It’s globalizing fast — but maybe not fast enough.

Many countries have turned to natural gas as part of a transition to cleaner energy, as they seek to phase out use of dirtier fossil fuels like coal and in some cases nuclear power too. Major producers — like the US, which has quickly risen up the ranks of LNG exporters to rival Qatar as the world’s biggest — are seeing surging demand for their output. Forty-four countries imported LNG last year, almost twice as many as a decade ago. But the fuel is much harder to shift around the planet than oil, because it has to be liquefied at places like the Freeport plant in Texas.

And that’s why a minor explosion at a facility seen as nothing special by industry insiders — it’s not the biggest or most sophisticated of the seven terminals that send LNG from American shores – had such an outsized impact.

‘The Current Crisis’

Gas prices in and Asia surged more than 60% in the weeks since Freeport was forced to temporarily shut down, a period that’s also seen further supply cuts by Russia. In the US, by contrast, prices for the fuel plunged almost 40% — because the outage means more of the gas will remain available for domestic use.

There were already plenty of signs of extreme tightness in the market. War and Covid may be roiling every commodity from wheat to aluminum and zinc, but little compares to the stomach-churning volatility of global gas prices. In Asia, the fuel is now about three times as expensive as a year ago. In Europe, it’s one of the main reasons why inflation just hit a fresh record.

Natural gas remains cheaper in the US — but even there, futures had more than doubled this year before the Freeport shutdown. With key political allies from Germany to Ukraine desperate to buy American gas, US manufacturers warn that more sales abroad will mean higher costs at home. The market reaction to the Freeport fire illustrates a “clear connection between LNG exports and the inflationary impacts to domestic prices for natural gas and electricity,” says Paul Cicio, president of the Industrial Energy Consumers of America.To meet all the new demand will require a massive wave of investment in supply. That’s already under way, and it got a boost at last week’s meeting of the Western world’s biggest economies, where G-7 leaders vowed to back public investments in gas projects — saying they’re “necessary in response to the current crisis.”

Among the urgent infrastructure needs:

Export facilities: The rush for LNG is accelerating projects in North America and beyond. Last month, Cheniere Energy (NYSE: ) greenlighted a terminal expansion in Texas. In April, a Canadian LNG project backed by Indonesian tycoon Sukanto Tanoto got the go-ahead to begin construction. In Qatar, Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: ) and Shell (AS: ) are among energy giants with stakes in a $29 billion project to boost LNG exports. “You have global gas prices so high that they incentivize the signing of new long-term contracts,” says Samantha Dart, head of natural gas research at Goldman Sachs. “We are seeing those announcements coming left and right, with a lot of US proposed liquefaction facilities.”

Germany, which has no LNG terminals, has allocated about $3 billion to charter four floating ones and connect them to the country’s network. The first one is supposed to go online around the end of this year. Emphasizing the need for speed, Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck pointed out that Tesla managed to build a factory near Berlin in just two years, and said it’s time to cut through German red tape. “First, dig the trench where the pipe is to go in,” he said. “Then, the permit comes.” China, the world’s top LNG buyer last year, is in the midst of one of the largest buildouts the industry has ever witnessed. Ten new import terminals are slated to come online in 2023 alone, and capacity will roughly double in the five years through 2025, according to BloombergNEF.

Pipelines: Even with more capacity to receive shipments of LNG and turn it back into gas form — a process known as regasification — Europe lacks infrastructure to move it where it might be needed. Spain, for example, has Europe’s biggest regasification facilities — but it only has two pipeline connections to France via the Pyrenees, capable of carrying little more than one-tenth of those volumes, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

Tankers: Shipyards in South Korea, where most of the world’s LNG tankers are built, are seeing a surge in orders that’s leaving them short of skilled labor. They’ve been forced to look outside the country to places like Thailand for welders, electricians and painters, raising their quotas for migrant workers.

In some cases all of this means a U-turn away from policies aimed at combating climate change -– especially in Europe. Government-backed lenders like the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which had been focused on financing renewable energy, have signaled a shift and said they’re now more willing to back gas projects.But Europe’s breakneck efforts won’t be enough, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, which calculates that LNG imports could meet 40% of the region’s gas needs by 2026 — double last year’s figure, but still far short of the volumes that Russia has been supplying.

‘Never More Evident’

That’s why warnings of a gas-driven slump in Europe’s economies are escalating.

Last week, Germany’s government said it’s in talks to bail out utility Uniper SE (ETR: ), which is losing some 30 million euros ($31 million) a day because it has to cover the missing Russian gas at soaring spot-market prices. Companies like chemicals giant BASF SE (OTC: ) say they may have to cut output. Deutsche Bank cited growing risks of an “imminent German recession on the back of energy rationing,” and pointed to soaring power prices in Italy and France too. Morgan Stanley predicted the whole euro area will be in a downturn by year-end.

For some emerging economies — which increasingly have to compete with rich countries like Germany in bidding for LNG cargoes, as gas goes global — the consequences have already been disastrous.

In Pakistan, which built its energy system on cheap LNG, planned blackouts are plunging regions into darkness during the sweltering summer months. Shopping malls and factories in major cities have been ordered to shut early, and government officials are working shorter hours.

Thailand is curbing LNG imports due to surging prices, potentially putting the country at risk of fuel shortages. Myanmar, which is grappling with political instability, stopped all LNG purchases late last year when prices started to rally. India and China have also cut back imports.

“Where once natural gas markets were largely regionally siloed, we now have a globalized spot market that has connected the world’s exposure to the fuel that has become critical to many economies,” said James Whistler, Singapore-based managing director at Vanir Global Markets, an energy and environmental brokerage. “This has never been more evident than in the past few months.”

Investing.com – Oil was down on Thursday morning in Asia as the latest COVID-19 outbreaks and fears of more lockdowns in China drove fuel demand fears.

slid 1.44% to $103.44 by 12:31 AM ET (4:31 AM GMT) and fell 1.36% to $100.63.

The Chinese capital city of Beijing reported 48 new symptomatic and two new asymptomatic COVID-19 cases for April 27, CCTV reported on Thursday. The city began a mass testing program to avoid a lockdown like the one that has been in place in Shanghai for a month.

The city of Hangzhou will also conduct mass COVID testing from Apr. 28, according to state media reported on Wednesday.

Concerns about tightening energy supplies globally added some support to the market. The tightening follows Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and subsequent sanctions on Russia by the U.S. and its allies. Russian energy giant Gazprom (MCX: ) also followed through on its threat to halt gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland on Wednesday.

Shell (AS: ) said in trading documents that it would no longer accept refined oil blended with Russian products. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) also said it had declared force majeure on its Sakhalin-1 operations in Russia’s far east.

Meanwhile, Wednesday’s showed a build of 692,000 barrels for the week to Apr. 22. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a build of 2 million barrels, while an 8.020-million-barrel draw was recorded during the previous week.

By Peter Nurse

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open largely unchanged Thursday after the Federal Reserve concluded its latest policy-setting meeting and as the corporate earnings season continues.

At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the contract in Germany traded flat, in France rose 0.1% and the contract in the U.K. was flat.

Investors have been parsing through the Federal Reserve , released late Wednesday, with the U.S. central bank saying that ""progress"" had been made toward its economic goals, potentially bringing forward the time when it might start reining in its bond-buying program. That currently runs at $120 billion a month.

That said, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear, in his subsequent press conference, that the U.S. economy still had to make substantial progress on jobs before any form of tapering, a more dovish tone that the statement suggested.

“Powell hinted that the Fed has already reached one out of two targets and that full employment and inflation ‘moderately exceeding the 2% target’ are not prerequisites for a taper decision. Interesting months are upcoming,” said analysts at Nordea in a note to clients.

European markets have received a positive handover from Asia after reports that Chinese authorities tried to calm market fears about a regulatory clampdown by calling banks overnight. This could allow European investors to concentrate more fully on the ongoing reporting season.

Airbus (PA: ), the world’s largest commercial planemaker, sharply raised its forecasts for full-year deliveries and earnings after reporting better-than-expected half-year results. Royal Dutch Shell (AS: ) also beat estimates, while Volkswagen (DE: ) raised its profit forecasts for the year and Anglo American PLC (LON: ) increased its stock buyback program by another $2 billion.

Credit Suisse (SIX: ) is also likely to be in the spotlight Thursday after the Swiss banking giant revealed that an independent external investigation into the Archegos scandal showed that it had failed “to effectively manage risk” but it had not been involved in any “fraudulent or illegal conduct”. Still, it posted a 78% fall in second-quarter net profit, hit by a sharp drop in its investment banking revenues.

Elsewhere, oil prices rose Thursday, helped by supplies falling to their lowest level since January 2020, resuming their downward trend after last week’s surprise build.

Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, released late Wednesday, showed that dropped by just over 4 million barrels during the week to July 23.

These stocks rose for the first time in nine weeks the previous week, prompting concerns that demand was peaking in the world’s largest consumer.

By Tom Bergin and Ron Bousso

(Reuters) -Bermuda and the Bahamas aren’t exactly big players in the oil-and-gas world. They don’t produce any of the fuels at all. Yet the islands are deep wells of profit for European oil giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc.

In 2018 and 2019, Shell earned more than $2.7 billion - about 7% of its total income in those years - tax-free by reporting profits in companies located in Bermuda and the Bahamas that employed just 39 people and generated the bulk of their revenue from other Shell entities, company filings show.

If the oil-and-gas major had booked the profits through its headquarters in the Netherlands, it could have faced a tax bill of about $700 million based on the Dutch corporate tax rate of 25%. The bill would have been much steeper if the income were reported in oil-producing countries - some of which levy rates exceeding 80%.

Shell and other oil majors are avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes in countries where they drill by shifting profits to thinly staffed insurance and finance affiliates based in tax havens, according to a Reuters review of corporate filings and rating agency reports. Shell, BP (LON: ) Plc, Chevron and Total use subsidiaries in the Bahamas, Switzerland, Bermuda, the UK Channel Islands and Ireland to provide their global operations with banking, insurance and oil-trading services, the documents show. These subsidiaries, in turn, book profits that go lightly taxed or entirely tax-free.

Such arrangements are not illegal. But they highlight the ability of international oil corporations to game global tax systems and avoid handing over revenue to nations where they conduct their core business, according to academics who study corporate taxation.

The profits generated by those offshore units are enormous, despite their tiny operations. BP’s so-called captive insurer - meaning it serves only other BP entities - had $6.5 billion in cash on hand at the end of 2018 after years of robust annual profits, according to insurance rating agency AM Best Co. The insurer, Jupiter Insurance Ltd, has accounted for as much as 14% of BP’s global annual profits in recent years, according to AM Best figures and BP’s financial statements. Jupiter has six directors but no employees; BP outsources insurance administration to a brokerage located in Guernsey, a tax haven in the UK Channel Islands.

Located about 75 miles south of the British coastline, Guernsey is not part of the UK but is a British crown dependency and sets its own tax rates. It charges no tax on corporate profits derived from revenues generated outside the island.

BP spokesman David Nicholas said Jupiter ""is a UK tax resident and therefore is subject to UK tax.""

But BP's insurer paid no UK taxes at all in 2019, according to the oil company's 2019 Tax Report, which was released Wednesday, the same day this story was published. BP offset Jupiter's taxable income with losses from other UK-based affiliates, which the BP report called a typical arrangment. BP said it released the tax report - for the first time - out of a desire to be more transparent about taxation.

The report said the company does not ""engage in artificial tax arrangements.""

The big oil firms’ captive insurers are far more profitable than a typical insurance company. That’s because the amount they pay in claims accounts for a far lower proportion of the money collected in premiums - all from other affiliates of the oil giants - than is the case at other insurers, Industry data shows. That means the captive insurance units absorb part of the revenue made by the oil majors’ subsidiaries elsewhere - often in high-tax countries where they extract oil and gas - and shift it to operations located in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions.

The oil companies have also transferred capital to tax havens to establish banking units that lend money to sister companies. Shell established an oil trader in the Bahamas that generates revenue primarily by buying and selling oil among other Shell affiliates.

The companies named in this story all said they followed tax rules of the nations where they do business. Their subsidiaries in tax havens, the companies said, were located there for commercial or operational reasons rather than to avoid taxation.

Shell denied that its arrangements constituted tax avoidance and said the location of its subsidiaries were driven by business rather than tax reasons.

Profit-shifting among affiliated companies has long been a concern among the Group of 20 nations, which have asked the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which helps coordinate international taxation rule-making, to find ways to rein in corporate tax avoidance. The organization in February issued new guidance on the treatment of intra-group financial transactions, advising nations to limit deductions on such payments.

Critics of corporate tax planning say oil firms’ profit-shifting undermines their claims to responsible corporate governance and exacerbates the deep budgetary problems that many oil-producing countries face amid the coronavirus pandemic and a related drop in oil prices.

“These companies are deliberately exploiting gaps in tax law and weak enforcement, and they are doing so in order to make enormous profits,” said Raymond Baker, president of Global Financial Integrity, a Washington D.C.-based not-for-profit organization that has lobbied for stricter international action against corporate tax avoidance. “The victims are the countries and their budgets and their people.”

Nations such as Angola, Brazil and Trinidad, who rely heavily on oil tax revenues, have had to moderate spending and increase borrowing to respond to the health crisis.

Nigeria is another country that relies heavily on oil tax revenues. Waziri Adio - executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which advocates for stronger governance of oil revenues - said the practices of oil companies may be legal but aren't fair.

“This is something that robs Nigeria of legitimate revenues and will affect the ability of the government to deliver badly needed services to its citizens,” Adio said.

The governments of Nigeria, Angola, Brazil and Trinidad did not respond to requests for comment.

Tax advisors said companies owe it to their shareholders to pay the lowest-possible tax bill.

“Tax planning is a legitimate part of business,” said Bryan Kelly, a partner with law firm Withers in Los Angeles. “The board of directors has a fiduciary duty to maximize profits.”

‘THE NUMBERS DON’T MAKE SENSE’

Shell booked $1.3 billion in 2018 and 2019 profits through Bermuda-based banking and insurance subsidiaries that together employed three people, according to the company’s ‘Tax Contribution Reports’ published in November this year and December 2019 which detail tax payments.

The tiny firms provide insurance and loans to Shell oil-producing facilities worldwide, although Shell said in its most recent tax report, published last month, that it ceased the intra-group lending from Bermuda in 2020 for reasons the company did not disclose. In 2018, the companies derived 96% of their revenues from other Shell companies.

The operations appear to exist primarily for tax purposes, said Richard Murphy, professor of political economy at City University of London. The high profitability of the Bermudan units – along with their heavy reliance on revenue from affiliates – suggests that they are designed to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions, he said.

“The numbers don’t make sense. If Shell is so good at making money in insurance and lending, why doesn’t it sell its services to outside companies and make even more money?” Murphy said.

Shell denied that its Bermuda operations are designed for tax avoidance. “Where Shell entities operate in low-tax jurisdictions, they are there for commercial and substantive reasons,” the company said in a statement.

Over $1.8 billion of Shell’s 2018 and 2019 tax-haven profits were booked by Shell Western Supply and Trading Ltd, a Bahamas-based oil trading operation employing 36 people, Shell said in its tax reports. The company buys oil from Shell fields and other producers in West Africa, Brazil and Guyana and sells two-thirds of the crude to other Shell affiliates.

The in-house oil trader outperforms other big oil merchants. Its annual profits were almost equal to the total $992 million that was earned through the end of September 2019 by independent oil trader Trafigura Group PTE Ltd - which employed 5,106 staff that year, Trafigura’s financial statements show. Shell Western enjoyed a profit margin of 4.1% across 2018 and 2019, according to its tax report. That’s more than four times the level independent oil traders typically report, according to financial statements of the three of the biggest industry players - The Vitol Group, Trafigura and Mercuria Energy Trading BV.

Margaret Cooper, a researcher at Henley Business School near London who studies multinational firms’ tax planning strategies, said that in-house oil trader’s location, its relative high profits and its dependence on trading with affiliated firms suggests that its dealings are designed to avoid taxes.

“I can’t think of any other reason than tax reasons why the company is located where it is,” Cooper said.

Shell declined to comment on whether Shell Western pays any taxes or to answer questions about whether its oil-trading operation is designed for tax avoidance. The company said in a statement that Shell Western’s profits are commensurate with its commercial activities.

BIG INSURANCE PROFITS, LOW TAXES FOR BP

BP’s unusually profitable insurer is housed in the picturesque St Peters Port, the largest town on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel.

A 2019 report from insurance rating agency AM Best noted strong underwriting profits and operating results over the past five years, resulting in a “very strong” balance sheet, with $6.5 billion in cash at the end of 2018.

AM Best reports from previous years include more details on the operation - including immense profits that would be the envy of any insurer.

In 2014, Jupiter had an operating ratio - which includes pay-outs and other costs as a share of premiums - of just 1.3%. That compares to more than 90% for most U.S. insurers, according to data from the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group. Jupiter booked profits totaling $5.8 billion from 2010 to 2013, the last year for which AM Best published profit figures. In 2013, Jupiter’s earnings amounted to 14% of the operating profit reported by BP in financial disclosures.

Jupiter’s profit margins remained exceptional through those years despite the explosion of BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig and subsequent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, one of the worst industrial accidents in history. The incident caused $70 billion in damages, but Jupiter’s payouts to affiliated companies were capped at $1.5 billion for any one event. So, the insurer kept a loss ratio under 15% of premium income for the years 2009 to 2013, according to a 2014 AM Best report.

BP group retained access to Jupiter’s hefty cash pile because the captive insurer lends 98% of its reserves back to Jupiter’s parent, London-based BP International Ltd, for terms of a year or less, according to AM Best. BP pays interest on the money back to Jupiter, adding to the insurer’s low-tax or no-tax profits.

Murphy, the University of London professor, estimates Jupiter could save BP hundreds of millions of dollars annually given its high profitability and the high tax rates that many countries place on oil production.

Jupiter’s registered office is on the first floor of Albert House on the Esplanade, overlooking the harbor in St Peter Port. The offices are not BP’s but belong to a multinational insurance brokerage and advisory company, Willis Towers.

Richard Parris Smith, head of office at Willis Towers Management Guernsey, said his firm manages Jupiter on behalf of BP and has 30 employees that serve all of its clients. Willis Towers lists 35 other captive insurers as clients on a sign outside its office door.

CHEVRON'S BERMUDA INSURER

California-based Chevron Corp (NYSE: ) operates a captive insurer in Bermuda. Until 2015, AM Best issued reports on Heddington Insurance Ltd and rated it highly due to its “good loss history” and “very strong investment income” made through high-interest loans to other Chevron companies. The rating agency did not report specific profit figures or operating ratios for Chevron’s insurer.

Chevron said it formed Heddington to reduce insurance costs and provide broader coverage than what is available in the commercial insurance market. The company said the insurer paid U.S. taxes but declined to detail how much or the effective rate.

Other oil firms have tax-haven subsidiaries through which they self-insure their facilities. France’s Total SA (PA: ) operates Swiss-based Omnium Reinsurance Company S.A., its financial filings show. Total did not respond to requests for comment about Omnium. Switzerland offers captive insurers special tax treatment and rates of less than 10%.

Italy’s Eni SpA operates an Irish-based insurer which covers the company’s facilities in places including Algeria and Nigeria. Like Shell and BP’s insurers, Dublin-based Eni Insurance DAC enjoys lower pay-out costs as a percentage of revenue than insurance industry averages. It reported a profit of 56 million euros in 2018, on which it paid tax at a rate of just 12.5% – half the Italian rate, and a fraction of the amount it would face in oil producing countries.

Eni Insurance DAC says in its financial statements that it aims to reduce insurance costs for the Eni group. Eni said its insurer generates strong profits because it does not have marketing costs to recruit clients like most insurers. The company said in a statement that the insurer’s premiums are in line with market rates and denied the business is designed for tax avoidance.

“The decision to establish the Eni Captive headquarters in Ireland was solely driven by business reasons,” the company said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/special-reporthow-oil-majors-shift-billions-in-profits-to-island-tax-havens-2264071,0.056,0.844,0.101,0.9991

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil companies such as BP (LON: ) and Shell (LON: ) are nurturing nature as a future revenue stream, betting on an expected rise in carbon credit prices as their fossil fuel profits ebb.

BP last year put $5 million into Finite Carbon, a company that connects forestry owners with companies seeking to offset their climate-warming emissions via-tree planting.

The Californian firm expects to generate $1 billion for landowners over the next 10 years, after a 20-40% cut of the proceeds, its chief executive Sean Carney said.

And as companies and countries have rushed over the last year to pledge new net-zero global warming pledges, that forecast may be too conservative, Carney said.

""When you put it next to all the announcements and all the talk, it's a really small number. We might be thinking too low here given the commitments,"" he told Reuters.

Graphic: Revenue ambitions dwarf current investments: https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/OIL-CARBONCREDITS/xklvybwampg/chart.png

Climate change goals, agreed in Paris in 2016, have fuelled a growing, but still immature, market for carbon offsets as companies and countries seek to fall in line.

European oil majors say investing in projects to create more credits is simply good business, offering new revenue streams at a time when oil prices have collapsed and appetite for new exploration evaporates.

""Investing in carbon sequestration, at a time when the world is increasingly carbon constrained, over time will prove to make good commercial, business sense,"" Duncan van Bergen, Shell's head of Nature Based Solutions, told Reuters.

Big oil's involvement has split environmentalists.

Sarah Leugers at the non-profit Gold Standard Registry welcomed interest from large emitters in nature conservation, but added:

""I do worry that they're initiating projects in a market that they can profit from that's attempting to solve a problem that they've largely created,"" Leugers said.

Others note the cash is going toward projects of universal benefit.

""Why would it be OK to make money with digging out fossil fuels, but not with saving the planet?"" said Renat Heuberger, CEO of the leading climate project developer South Pole, which typically takes a 10% cut from credits it develops and sells.

CARBON KLONDIKE

Although some industries are covered by carbon-trading schemes enshrined in law, such as in the European Union, California and Australia, most of the world has no such government-backed markets.

That leaves most emitters with only a handful of small, voluntary carbon offset markets launched over the last 15 years.

And as more seek credits, the price is expected to rise.

Shell's budgets, for example, are based on a carbon price of $85, or around 70 euros, a tonne by 2050 which is more than twice the current price of just under 30 euros on the EU carbon-trading scheme.

While each ""registry"", or voluntary market, has its own rules for entry, they generally work by certifying credits for carbon-reducing projects which preserve forests or wetlands or help swap out wood or coal burning stoves with ones using cleaner fuels.

The entire voluntary carbon offset market last year was worth around $300 million, trading offsets for around 104 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), according to Ecosystem Marketplace, the main aggregator of these data.

However, that compares with the 33 billion tonnes of CO2e emitted by the energy sector alone in 2019, of which 2.1 billion tonnes came from products made by European energy majors, International Energy Agency and Reuters calculations show.

Graphic: How small is the voluntary carbon offset market?: https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/OIL-CARBONCREDITS/oakvexkkmpr/chart.png

A November report by a taskforce of investors and emitters led by former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the voluntary market would have to grow 15-fold to meet the goal of avoiding catastrophic climate change.

Oil majors are playing a growing role in this as they seek to establish themselves in the new carbon neutral world order, with France's Total earmarking $100 million a year for nature-based solutions, including an unspecified amount toward creating credits.

Shell plans to spend $100 million on average over the next year or two on nature-based carbon offsets and van Bergen expects emissions cuts from nature-based solutions or carbon sinks will be ""material"" by 2030 or 2035.

In August it bought Select Carbon which helps farmers in Australia modify their land use and certifies credits for use in a government-managed scheme or sold on the secondary market.

BP's investment in Finite Carbon went toward software that allows landowners to monetise the planting of new trees or preservation of existing woodlands.

Using machine learning, remote sensing and digital payments, the software is aimed at landowners with parcels as small as 40 acres, too small to take part in many carbon markets.

For BP's head of ventures Nacho Gimenez, the Finite Carbon investment fits with a responsibility to rein in emissions.

""As long as someone is investing in something positive, that's the baseline,"" Gimenez told Reuters.

Such nature-based offsets could remove up to 12 billion tonnes of emissions a year on the back of $120-$360 billion spending by emitters, British bank Barclays (LON: ) estimates.

But with no global standard for evaluating the carbon impact of a project or for pricing credits, a credit from the same project can fetch a higher price in one sale than in another.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/big-carbon-oil-majors-turn-to-nature-to-help-plug-revenue-gap-2263156,0.036,0.845,0.119,0.9973

At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the in Germany traded 0.9% lower, the in France fell 0.7% and the U.K.'s index dropped 1.1%.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made it clear at a conference on Thursday that the central bank wouldn’t be changing its ultra-loose monetary policy any time soon.

The February U.S. is due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and will be studied closely, with the addition of 182,000 payrolls expected, compared with just 49,000 in January.

Adding to the concerns Friday were worries about a global fight for Covid-19 vaccines after a shipment of 250,000 doses of AstraZeneca’s drug that were destined for Australia was blocked by Italy under a new European Union regulation. Italy is one of a number of EU countries to have experienced a rise in Covid-19 cases over the last two weeks.

The World Health Organization warned that the number of new coronavirus infections globally rose last week for the first time in seven weeks.

Oil and gas stocks outperformed as crude prices pushed higher, following the decision of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies not to increase output in April. Equinor stock rose 1.8% to its highest in over a year, while Royal Dutch Shell (AS: ) stock and Total (PA: ) stock edged down by less than half a percent each.

Investing.com -- Stocks rose modestly on Wednesday as big tech earnings surprises rolled in.

Google parent Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: ) helped lift the broader market after better-than-expected profit and revenue as ad spending returned to YouTube and Search businesses.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ), on the other hand, fell slightly after news its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos was stepping away from day to day management later this year.

The biggest influence in the market is a report that President Joe Biden is considering compromises on his proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus, including sending checks to a smaller group of Americans.

The apparent olive branch could potentially sway some Republicans to warm up to the idea of backing the bill, helping Democrats secure the GOP votes that would be needed in the Senate.

The economic recovery continues to strengthen, according to job and other data that will be confirmed by the government’s official job report for January this Friday.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. Earnings from big pharma and big oil

Pharmaceutical giants Merck & Company Inc (NYSE: ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: ) report earnings on Thursday, as does oil giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) PLC Class A (AS: ).

Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect Merck to report earnings per share of $1.38 on revenue of $12.7 billion. Bristol Myers is seen with EPS of $1.41 on sales of $10.7 billion. Shell is expected to have EPS of 14 cents on revenue of $53 billion.

2. Jobless claims

More jobless data is due out Thursday at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), namely in the form of unemployment benefit claims. are expected to be 830,000 and claims are expected to be 4.7 million.

On Wednesday, ADP (NASDAQ: ) said private-sector employment rose by 174,000 last month, surpassing the 70,000 job gains expected.

3. Zoom Video gets a competitor

The software IPO boom continues with Wednesday’s debut of video-marketing company ON24 Inc (NYSE: ). The shares surged 45% on their first trading day after pricing to above $70 after pricing at $50.

ON24 raised $315 million in the offering. The pandemic-winning online communication company Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ) also jumped big-time after its 2019 IPO.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (LON: ) may face calls to pay compensation or a fine when an Australian parliamentary inquiry releases an interim report on Wednesday into how the firm legally destroyed ancient sacred rock shelters for an iron ore mine, industry sources said.

The inquiry into the destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelter in May has heard testimony from dozens of people and more than 140 submissions from miners, heritage specialists and Aboriginal and civil society groups.

The committee is due to table its report to the Senate on Wednesday afternoon, after COVID-19 disruptions delayed hearings, and is now more likely to finish in the second half of 2021 once it has heard testimony from other states, an official told Reuters.

It is widely expected to castigate Rio on its failures as well as propose mining industry and legal reform. Its findings may also include a call for compensation.

""I think the only risk is that Rio has to pay some form of restitution,"" said analyst Glyn Lawcock of UBS in Sydney.

Even then, in the context of Rio Tinto's $123 billion valuation, the amount was not likely to be material; however recommendations to overhaul legislation could result in delays to industry mine expansion plans in the years ahead, he said.

""That could slow the process down and that will have an impact on global supply and demand at the end of the day,"" he said. Western Australia supplies 55% of China's iron ore needs.

Rio is also expected to announce its new chief executive any day, after Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two other senior leaders agreed to step down in August due to the procedural failings it found led to the disaster and the way it was initially managed.

Front runners for the new job include Shell (LON: ) Australia chairman Zoe Yujnovich, who once ran Rio's Canadian iron ore business, former BP (LON: ) Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary, Anglo American (LON: ) finance director Stephen Pearce, OZ Minerals CEO Andrew Cole, and former Fortescue Metals Group CEO Nev Power.

MILAN (Reuters) - Shell (LON: )'s former international upstream head Malcolm Brinded had no reason to think that the awarding of the OPL-245 oilfield license in Nigeria was illegal, his lawyer said on Wednesday.

In a court hearing in Milan, Marco Calleri said his client believed the deal would bring money and benefits to Nigeria and its government and that it was lawful and correct.

""I stand by my view that there is absolutely no basis for the charges against me,"" Brinded said in a comment sent by email.

Brinded is one of four former Shell executives caught up in a long-running bribery case revolving around the purchase of the OPL 245 offshore field in 2011 for about $1.3 billion.

Prosecutors allege that about $1.1 billion of that was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen.

By Geoffrey Smith

Investing.com -- Crude oil prices came off eight-month highs in early trading in New York on Friday, but held on to almost all of the gains posted in reaction to a reassuring show of discipline and restraint from the world’s biggest producer nations.

By 11:20 AM ET (1545 GMT), futures were up 1.0% at $46.09 a barrel, while the international benchmark was up 0.8% at $49.10 a barrel. Brent had come within 14 cents of the psychologically important $50 mark in the overnight session, but weakened after the U.S. labor market report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring in the U.S. economy that bodes ill for short-term demand. Nonfarm payrolls grew by only 245,000 in the month through mid-November, the smallest gain in employment since the pandemic erupted earlier this year.

There was slightly better news from U.S. factory orders, which eked out a gain of 1.0% in November, a gentler decline than expected.

Prices appear to be heading into a new, higher range after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia removed the tail risk of a new price war over output policy, with the decision to allow a small increase in production from the end of this year.

The development of multiple vaccines that are expected to allow a return to normal life next year, coupled with the fact that the dip in demand caused by the latest wave has not been as severe as many feared, allowed the OPEC+ bloc to accommodate pressure from countries led by the United Arab Emirates who had argued for raising the production ceiling.

However, the fact remains that the bloc had been expected at the start of this week to freeze output levels for another three months. As such, the market is now rallying on a negative supply shock, something that some analysts are finding hard to swallow. With stocks also rallying on the day of a weak labor market, many are taking this as another sign of the ""Labrador market"" that is simply delighted with everything it sees.

""OPEC raise production? Yay! Bullish on less spare capacity!"" Paul Sankey of Sankey research wrote - ironically - in emailed comments.

But even after the recent surge - up over 30% since the start of November - oil prices still aren't high enough to encourage private investment in production, John Hofmeister, the former head of Royal Dutch Shell (LON: )'s U.S. operations, told Fox Business News earlier this week. Chevron (NYSE: ) became the latest oil major to make further cuts to its capital spending plans on Thursday, a trend that will make it harder for them to sustain production at current levels in future.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/crude-oil-prices-come-off-highs-as-opec-removes-tail-risk-2261930,0.089,0.81,0.101,0.8186

SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

MILAN (Reuters) - The sale of a Nigerian oilfield to Eni and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) was legally ""perfect"" and there was no proof of any corruption, a lawyer for former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete said on Wednesday.

Antonio Secci told a Milan court that prosecutors in the case had been unable to show exactly what role Etete was meant to have had in the alleged corruption of Nigerian public officials - if he had corrupted politicians or had simply been an intermediary between the two majors and the Abuja government.

Eni and Shell acquired the offshore OLP 245 field in 2011 for about $1.3 billion from Malabu, a company owned by the former Nigerian oil minister.

Prosecutors allege that about $1.1 billion of that money was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen, half of it to Etete himself.

Shell says the 2011 agreement was a settlement of long-standing litigation, following the previous allocation of the block by the Nigerian government to Shell and Malabu.

Secci told the court the money had first been paid into an escrow account owned by the Nigerian government before then being transferred to Malabu ""without any corruption (involving Nigerian public officials) emerging.""

He called for his client to be acquitted.

Besides Eni and Shell, another 13 people, including current Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi, are involved in the long-running graft case.

All the defendants have denied any wrongdoing, saying the purchase price was paid into an official Nigerian government account with all subsequent transfers being beyond their control.

By Bart H. Meijer

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Environmentalists seeking to drive down emissions produced by energy giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) told a Dutch court on Thursday the Netherlands was the right place to hear their case.

Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and five other groups are demanding that Shell drastically cut emissions of greenhouse gases in a lawsuit filed in 2019 in the Netherlands, where the company has its headquarters.

Lawyers for the company, which has subsidiaries around the world, said any damage caused by any emissions should be judged in countries where those emissions took place.

""Decisions made in the Netherlands determine Shell's investments and divestments and shape the company's energy portfolio,"" the lawyer representing the environmental groups, Roger Cox, told the district court in The Hague.

""This makes the head office the cause of any environmental damage, now and in the future,"" he said.

The groups filed the case on behalf of more than 17,000 Dutch citizens who say the oil major is threatening human rights by investing billions of dollars in producing fossil fuels.

A lawyer acting for Shell, Jan de Bie Leuveling Tjeenk, told the court in response: ""Emissions are caused by Shell's subsidiaries and by users of Shell's products.""

He added: ""The place where Shell's policies are made is not where the emissions occurred. Damage should be judged by courts in the countries where it was suffered.""

The environmentalists are demanding Shell cuts its greenhouse gas emissions almost in half by 2030 and to zero by 2050, seeking to force the Anglo-Dutch firm to move swiftly away from oil and gas and direct investment to sustainable sources of energy.

Shell has said it aimed to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 30% by 2035, compared with 2016 levels. Environmentalists say that is not enough.

The green groups have cited a 2019 case in which the Dutch High Court ordered the government to step up the fight against climate change, saying a lack of action was putting Dutch citizens in danger.

""If the state is responsible for the emissions of Dutch society as a whole, than Shell's parent company should be held responsible for all the emissions by its subsidiaries,"" Cox said.

(Reuters) - London's rose to a nine-month high on Friday as a jump in oil prices boosted energy stocks, while investors remained focussed on Brexit trade talks with only four weeks left for Britain's transition period out of the bloc to end.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 rose 0.8%, with BP (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) among the biggest gainers as major oil producers agreed to continue production cuts to overcome coronavirus-induced demand concerns.

The FTSE 100 has soared 17% in the past five weeks as news that a working COVID-19 vaccine would be available before year-end sparked hopes of a swift economic recovery, but analysts have cautioned about the near-term damage to the economy from sweeping business restrictions.

""The vaccine is truly a wonderful development, but it's not going to instantaneously change the short-term economic performance,"" said Brian Hilliard, chief UK economist at SocGen.

Data on Thursday showed activity in the UK services sector in November suffered its first fall since June following a four-week partial lockdown across England.

The mid-cap , considered a barometer of Brexit sentiment, rose 0.2%, led by the real estate, technology and consumer staples sectors.

Brexit trade talks are in a difficult phase and a deal can only be struck if the European Union accepts that Britain is a sovereign nation, a British minister said on Friday after London indicated that the chance of a breakthrough was receding.

""This is not a seamless imperceptible transition to a new trading arrangement (and) there will be an impact on UK trade,"" Hilliard said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's top energy companies have slashed the value of their oil and gas assets by around $80 billion (60.05 billion pounds) in recent months after revising lower the long-term outlook for fuel prices in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic and the energy transition.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), the largest U.S. oil company, announced on Monday it would write down the value of properties by $17 billion to $20 billion, its biggest ever impairment following the sharp drop in energy prices this year.

It follows similar steps by rivals including Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), BP (LON: ) and Chevron (NYSE: ) since late 2019.

For graphic of Downsizing: https://graphics.reuters.com/OIL-WRITEDOWNS/qmypmxlrovr/chart.png

The so-called oil majors are ""acknowledging overly optimistic commodity price views of yesteryear,"" said Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint.

Most of Exxon's impairments focused on legacy assets from its $30 billion acquisition of U.S. shale producer XTO Energy in 2010, a deal former CEO Rex Tillerson had previously said was ""ill-timed.""

Following the impairments, companies will focus on the parts of the business that are able to withstand the lowest oil and gas prices, Clint said.

""Balance sheets now reflect the lowest portfolio break-evens in two decades and therefore the most resilient to future commodity price shocks.""

Exxon did not disclose its new commodity price outlook. The value of the oil majors plummeted in 2020 after energy demand collapsed due to the pandemic.

The shares of Exxon, Shell and BP have lost over 45% so far this year, more than benchmark prices that have lost around 27% and stand today near $48 a barrel.

The impairments made by the European majors also came after they lowered their long-term oil prices forecasts as they prepare to increasingly switch to renewable energy in the coming decades to reduce carbon emissions to net zero.

The revisions might nevertheless lead to a sharp rise in oil prices in the coming years as a result of lower investments in new projects, Clint said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian pipe-laying vessel Akademik Cherskiy stopped on Saturday near the construction site of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea, Refinitiv Eikon data showed on Saturday.

The consortium led by Gazprom (MCX: ) building the 1,230 kilometre (km) pipeline said last month that work would resume after it was suspended a year ago when U.S. sanctions targeted companies involved in the construction.

The U.S. ambassador to Berlin called on the German government and the European Union to put a temporary halt to construction work on the pipeline to send a signal to Moscow.

Washington says the pipeline, which has become a flashpoint in relations between Russia and the West that have sunk to post-Cold War lows, compromises European energy security.

""This pipeline is not just an economic project, but the Kremlin's political tool to bypass Ukraine and divide Europe,"" Robin Quinville, acting U.S. ambassador to Berlin, told Germany's Handelsblatt daily.

Eikon data showed the Russian pipe-laying vessel has stopped north of Poland and Germany. Swiss-Dutch company Allseas suspended pipe-laying last December following the threat of sanctions from Washington.

The maritime authority in the German city of Stralsund has informed shippers there will be pipeline-laying activities from Dec. 5 through Dec. 31 in the Baltic Sea area where Nord Stream 2 will make landfall.

It did not say when the work would be finished or how the other remaining sections of the pipeline would be laid, adding that it will name the vessel, which would lay pipes, later. It declined to comment further on Friday.

The $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, led by Russian state energy company Gazprom and aimed at doubling the existing Nord Stream pipeline's capacity, is more than 90% complete.

However, the annual U.S. defence policy bill unveiled by lawmakers late on Thursday contains sanctions that backers say will halt Nord Stream 2.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) will face a Dutch court on Tuesday in the first hearing of a case brought on by environmentalist and human rights groups who demand the energy firm cuts its reliance on fossil fuels.

Seven activist groups, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth Netherlands, filed the lawsuit in April last year on behalf of over 17,000 Dutch citizens who demand that Shell cuts its greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.

The plaintiffs say that Shell is threatening human rights by knowingly undermining international climate goals, as it keeps investing billions in the exploitation of fossil fuels.

""We are confident that the judge’s final verdict will force Shell to adhere to international climate goals and stop causing dangerous climate change"", Friends of the Earth Netherlands director Donald Pols said on the eve of the hearing.

Anglo-Dutch Shell has repeatedly said it supports the goals set out in the 2015 Paris agreement to combat climate change and has promised to cut the carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 30% by 2035, compared with 2016 levels, and by 65% in 2050.

But the action groups demand at least a 45% reduction by 2030, relative to the pollution caused in 2019, as a step towards carbon-neutral production two decades later.

The groups feel strengthened by the so-called 'Urgenda' case, in which the Dutch High Court last year ordered its government to step up the fight against climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions faster than planned.

The district court of The Hague, home of Shell's Dutch headquarters, has planned four days of hearings in the case in December.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-faces-dutch-court-as-climate-change-activists-demand-end-to-emissions-2259474,0.076,0.862,0.062,-0.1901

LONDON (Reuters) - For Big Oil, coffee and chocolate could be the new black gold.

Under pressure from investors and governments alike to cut emissions, major European oil companies are ploughing billions into renewable energy but are struggling to craft business plans that promise the returns shareholders have come to expect.

Europe's big oil firms, however, have another card to play: their vast global networks of filling stations.

BP (LON: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Total all say they are betting on higher profits from sales of groceries and snacks at their retail networks, which will still be an essential port of call for motorists in an electric era.

Paying at the pump to fill up with petrol may only take a few minutes, but even with the fastest electric vehicle (EV) chargers, customers would have at least 10 to 15 minutes to kill - plenty of time to grab a coffee and do some shopping.

While the so-called marketing operations of big oil firms - retail sales of fuel, lubricants, groceries and TV dinners - usually contribute a smaller slice of profits than oil and gas production, they typically have higher margins.

The renewable energy and power businesses oil companies are moving into, however, tend to have lower returns on investment, making it important for firms such as BP and Shell to find ways to boost their overall returns in low-carbon economies.

That's why Shell plans to expand its retail network by more than 20% to 55,000 sites worldwide by 2025. BP aims to increase its network of filling stations by nearly 50% to 29,000 by 2030 and boost its EV charging network to 70,000 points.

Total, meanwhile, is planning to increase its EV charging network in Europe to 150,000 points by 2025 from 18,000 now.

Subway and McDonald's, the world's two biggest food chains, both have fewer outlets than Shell. U.S. giant Walmart (NYSE: ), the world's biggest retailer by sales, has 11,510 stores globally.

BP and Shell are also betting that daily contact with tens of millions of customers will give it masses of data that it can use to tailor sales for shoppers in small towns, cities or even specific petrol stations throughout the world.

LOCKDOWN PREVIEW

While there are relatively few electric cars on the road now, oil companies have already had a glimpse of the potential of their retail networks during coronavirus lockdowns this year.

Fuel sales slumped as travel restrictions kicked in, but people still nipped to nearby petrol stations with convenience stores to stock up on daily necessities.

In fact, Shell's retail division, known as ""marketing"", which has the world's biggest network of filling stations, had its best quarter on record in the three months to Sept. 30, bringing in $1.6 billion in adjusted earnings.

So far in 2020, Shell's marketing division has contributed 60% of its overall earnings, which are traditionally dominated by its upstream oil and integrated gas businesses.

Huibert Vigeveno, Shell's head of refining, chemicals and marketing, said the company holds a daily call to check on customer preferences for anything from engine oil to croissants so it can constantly adapt.

""Having 45,000 retail sites over more than 80 countries allowed us to learn very fast,"" he told Reuters.

""It started in January, when we saw what was happening in China and how consumers were behaving. And we shared that immediately with all the 80 countries in which we operate.""

Shell's marketing profits were also helped by strong sales of premium fuels, which have higher margins, and lubricants.

BP and Total benefited from a boost at their retail divisions during the pandemic months too, helping to plug revenue shortfalls from lower fuel sales and reinforce their plans to expand rapidly into convenience stores and EV charging.

""We saw during the pandemic people shopping online and topping up in local stores like ours, but it's a long-term trend, too,"" said Emma Delaney, BP head of customers and products.

Total's Chief Financial Officer Jean-Pierre Sbraire told investors in October that retail sales in Europe were back at pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter, even though fuel sales remained very weak.

LOW VOLATILITY

BP's profit margins from convenience stores have risen 8% a year since 2015 and they delivered a gross margin of more than $1 billion in 2019, a figure the company aims to more than double by 2030, Delaney told Reuters.

BP's return on investment - or the return on average capital employed - at its convenience and mobility business, which includes sales of fuel and lubricants as well as its stores, was more than 20% in 2019.

Shell too had a return on investment of over 20% at its marketing division, which includes retail, business-to-business fuel sales and lubricants, and Vigeveno said it expects the business to grow 6% to 7% a year until 2025 and beyond.

Return on investment has been in the spotlight since oil majors such as BP announced this year that it plans to cut its fossil fuel production and invest more heavily in low-carbon energy sources such as wind and solar power.

Shell is also looking to accelerate its shift towards low-carbon energy and is due to announce its long-term transition strategy in February.

While big oil firms typically target a return on oil investments of about 15%, returns on low-carbon electricity are expected to be far lower and investors are wondering how they will square the circle.

IS DATA THE NEW OIL?

When it comes to retail, fuel sales already produce lower profit margins than convenience stores sales, which are often in partnership with well-known grocery brands, and that's one of the reasons for the push into areas dominated by supermarkets.

""Redefining convenience is about much more than fuel. Sure, convenient fuel payment via our app works, but customers on the go want much more than fuel. And so we bake pastries, brew coffee, package deliveries for customers,"" Delaney said.

BP works with Marks & Spencer in Britain while Shell has a partnership with British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to offer a range of deli food. In the United States, BP has teamed up with food and drink outlet ampm.

During the months of the pandemic, convenience sales at hundreds of sites were also helped by deliveries to homes using online apps such as Deliveroo and Uber (NYSE: ) Eats, Vigeveno said.

BP estimates that more than half the customers who visit Marks & Spencer at its filling stations come for convenience shopping only. Shell's Vigeveno, meanwhile, said half of their sales in northwest Europe were non-fuel.

Even with a retail push, fierce competition among power companies, supermarket giants such as Tesco (LON: ) in Britain or Carrefour (PA: ) in France and new entrants in the EV charging sector could also narrow profit margins in the future.

And with oil consumption possibly already near its peak, energy companies will need to radically rethink their retail businesses to keep making money.

""To successfully adapt, fuel retailers must embrace a new mindset. Making modest changes or tweaks to the business will not suffice,"" said Boston Consulting Group's Rubeis, adding that the customer data they amass could be crucial.

BP aims to double the daily number of ""customer touchpoints"" in its retail business over the next decade to 20 million while Shell is aiming for 40 million by 2025 from 30 million now.

LONDON (Reuters) - For Big Oil, coffee and chocolate could be the new black gold.

Under pressure from investors and governments alike to cut emissions, major European oil companies are ploughing billions into renewable energy but are struggling to craft business plans that promise the returns shareholders have come to expect.

Europe's big oil firms, however, have another card to play: their vast global networks of filling stations.

BP (LON: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Total all say they are betting on higher profits from sales of groceries and snacks at their retail networks, which will still be an essential port of call for motorists in an electric era.

Paying at the pump to fill up with petrol may only take a few minutes, but even with the fastest electric vehicle (EV) chargers, customers would have at least 10 to 15 minutes to kill - plenty of time to grab a coffee and do some shopping.

While the so-called marketing operations of big oil firms - retail sales of fuel, lubricants, groceries and TV dinners - usually contribute a smaller slice of profits than oil and gas production, they typically have higher margins.

The renewable energy and power businesses oil companies are moving into, however, tend to have lower returns on investment, making it important for firms such as BP and Shell to find ways to boost their overall returns in low-carbon economies.

That's why Shell plans to expand its retail network by more than 20% to 55,000 sites worldwide by 2025. BP aims to increase its network of filling stations by nearly 50% to 29,000 by 2030 and boost its EV charging network to 70,000 points.

Total, meanwhile, is planning to increase its EV charging network in Europe to 150,000 points by 2025 from 18,000 now.

Subway and McDonald's, the world's two biggest food chains, both have fewer outlets than Shell. U.S. giant Walmart (NYSE: ), the world's biggest retailer by sales, has 11,510 stores globally.

BP and Shell are also betting that daily contact with tens of millions of customers will give it masses of data that it can use to tailor sales for shoppers in small towns, cities or even specific petrol stations throughout the world.

LOCKDOWN PREVIEW

While there are relatively few electric cars on the road now, oil companies have already had a glimpse of the potential of their retail networks during coronavirus lockdowns this year.

Fuel sales slumped as travel restrictions kicked in, but people still nipped to nearby petrol stations with convenience stores to stock up on daily necessities.

In fact, Shell's retail division, known as ""marketing"", which has the world's biggest network of filling stations, had its best quarter on record in the three months to Sept. 30, bringing in $1.6 billion in adjusted earnings.

So far in 2020, Shell's marketing division has contributed 60% of its overall earnings, which are traditionally dominated by its upstream oil and integrated gas businesses.

Huibert Vigeveno, Shell's head of refining, chemicals and marketing, said the company holds a daily call to check on customer preferences for anything from engine oil to croissants so it can constantly adapt.

""Having 45,000 retail sites over more than 80 countries allowed us to learn very fast,"" he told Reuters.

""It started in January, when we saw what was happening in China and how consumers were behaving. And we shared that immediately with all the 80 countries in which we operate.""

Shell's marketing profits were also helped by strong sales of premium fuels, which have higher margins, and lubricants.

BP and Total benefited from a boost at their retail divisions during the pandemic months too, helping to plug revenue shortfalls from lower fuel sales and reinforce their plans to expand rapidly into convenience stores and EV charging.

""We saw during the pandemic people shopping online and topping up in local stores like ours, but it's a long-term trend, too,"" said Emma Delaney, BP head of customers and products.

Total's Chief Financial Officer Jean-Pierre Sbraire told investors in October that retail sales in Europe were back at pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter, even though fuel sales remained very weak.

LOW VOLATILITY

BP's profit margins from convenience stores have risen 8% a year since 2015 and they delivered a gross margin of more than $1 billion in 2019, a figure the company aims to more than double by 2030, Delaney told Reuters.

BP's return on investment - or the return on average capital employed - at its convenience and mobility business, which includes sales of fuel and lubricants as well as its stores, was more than 20% in 2019.

Shell too had a return on investment of over 20% at its marketing division, which includes retail, business-to-business fuel sales and lubricants, and Vigeveno said it expects the business to grow 6% to 7% a year until 2025 and beyond.

""The volatility in retail is very low ... but the margin is high,"" said Mirko Rubeis of the Boston Consulting Group. (Graphic: Shell's marketing business delivers steady profits, https://graphics.reuters.com/OIL-RETAIL/yzdpxkzelvx/chart.png)

Investing.com -- prices soared to their highest since March on Tuesday, as optimism over the economic outlook for 2021 strengthened.

By 11:30 AM ET (1630 GMT), U.S. futures were up 46% at $45.04 a barrel, while the international benchmark was up 3.8% at $47.77 barrel.

U.S. futures were likewise sharply higher, rising 4.8% to $1.2623 a gallon, their highest since early September.

On a day of little industry-specific news, oil and other industrial commodities ripped higher as investors bought ever more aggressively into the notion that the distribution of vaccines to fight Covid-19 will lead to a vigorous snapback in growth next year. Three companies have so far declared that their experimental drugs have success rates of 90% or more in preventing the disease. None, however, has official regulatory approval from any jurisdiction yet.

The enthusiasm was reinforced by the sight of the political fog lifting over Washington, with President Donald Trump all-but conceding the election to Joe Biden in the wake of Michigan's certification of its results on Monday. Biden has reportedly named former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as his pick for Treasury Secretary, which has encouraged hope in a broadly expansionary fiscal policy next year. Those hopes overlook the fact that the Senate is still likely to remain in Republican hands, complicating any efforts to get major fiscal expansion passed.

Signs from the industry itself still appear mixed: Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Total both announced the closure of big refineries on Tuesday, one in Louisiana, the other in France, in a reflection of the collapse in refining margins in recent months.

The market was also encouraged by what it chose to take as hints of further cooperation between Russia and Saudi Arabia in keeping excess supply off world markets for the coming months. President Vladimir Putin held a telephone call with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman earlier Tuesday. The Kremlin's summary of the conversation nodded to what it called their ""effective"" coordination of oil supplies this year, strengthening expectations that the planned increase in production by the so-called OPEC+ bloc will be pushed back for perhaps as much as three months to the start of April Newswires reported Saudi and Russian officials downplaying suggestions of coordination ahead of next week's ministerial meeting, at which any such decisions will be taken.

NEW YORK/MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - China, the global oil market's lifeline this year, has stepped up purchases from exporters like Russia, the United States and Angola in recent weeks, while buyers elsewhere pare orders as coronavirus infections surge and fresh lockdowns are put in place.

China, the world's largest importer of crude, is the only major buyer expected to see increased oil demand this year as the pandemic destroyed consumption globally.

With China's imports expected to reach 12 million barrels per day (bpd) next year, sellers are lining up shipments to retain market share as worldwide oil consumption is expected to fall by nearly 9% in 2020.

(For graphic on Global oil demand by region during Q2 and Q3 2020: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/azgpojbjrvd/GlobalOilDemandQ2Q3.png)

This week, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ), Russian Lukoil's (MM: ) trading arm Litasco and Unipec, the trading arm of China's state-owned Sinopec (SS: ), have provisionally booked, or are looking to book supertankers to ship from the Gulf Coast to Asia in December, according to shipbrokers and Refinitiv Eikon data.

COVID-19 infections are rising worldwide, particularly in heavy fuel users like the United States and Europe.

For the last few months, that pushed the prices of key crude grades lower, allowing Chinese buyers to take advantage. The country is also ramping up commercial oil stockpiling, buying oil at low prices to increase reserves.

The International Energy Agency said last week that China was on track to be the only major country to boost its demand for oil year-on-year. It estimates global demand at 91.3 million bpd in 2020, down from 100.1 million bpd in 2019.

""Lockdowns will probably be in place in Europe for much of this winter. China has raised its quotas and (storage) capacity. It looks like the demand will be centered there in the near future,"" a trader at a European refiner said.

The premium for Russian January-loading ESPO Blend crude, one of the most popular grades for Chinese independent oil refiners, is at five-month highs.

U.S. crude grades are rebounding as well, with WTI in East Houston climbing to its highest in about two months this week. U.S. grades have been pressured due to a 12% drop in domestic fuel demand and as new COVID-19 infections hit daily records.

These come on the back of firmer Middle East crude prices, which makes up the baseload of Asia's demand. This week, Qatar sold January-loading al-Shaheen crude at the highest premiums in four months.

""Chinese demand is more visible now,"" one trader in the Russian Far East crude oil market told Reuters. ""Trading firms are very active as they expect more requests from China's independent oil refiners that will buy oil under new import quotas.""

A Chinese buyer said traders were offering U.S. crude, North Sea Forties and West African grades as they expected arbitrage economics to improve after sharp gains in Middle East prices.

(For graphic on China crude oil imports by region: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gjnpwbljrvw/ChinaOilImportsbyRegion.png)

Premiums for ESPO Blend firmed to $2.90 per barrel above Dubai quotes this week, their highest since June, as trading of January volumes began. Russia's Sokol crude cargoes loading in January also recently firmed to four-month highs.

Oil grades that have higher naphtha yields such as light, sweet U.S. crudes, are in higher demand from petrochemical buyers, one trader with an Asian refiner said. Light grades produce more gas oil, used for heating, which is also in greater demand, versus jet fuel, where consumption has collapsed.

One senior Chinese trader said heavier crude grades, such as in West Africa, were seeing less robust demand. In Angola, Africa's second biggest crude exporter, heavier grade Dalia is trading at a lower premium than medium grades Cabinda and Girassol, which were at multi-month highs.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/global-crude-market-finds-support-mainly-from-china-demand-2253476,0.115,0.817,0.068,-0.9864

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Can you put a price on pollution? Some of the world's biggest economies are doing just that as they wrestle with how to make good on grand pledges to tame planet-warming emissions.

Matters are coming to a head.

China, Japan and South Korea have all followed the European Union in pledging to cut emissions to ""net zero"" in recent weeks, where they release only as much as they remove from the air. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden made the same promise in his election campaign.

Next year they are set to lay out the first practical measures to meet these targets, as part of commitments under the Paris climate accord, and putting a price on carbon will be front and centre, experts told Reuters.

""Each country will have to come up with its own path to reaching net zero, but the expectation is carbon pricing is going to be a very important part,"" said Wendy Hughes, Carbon Markets and Innovation Manager at the World Bank.

The principle is simple: a carbon price establishes how much companies need to pay for their emissions. The higher the price, the greater the incentive to pollute less and invest in low-carbon technology.

Governments can force these payments through a carbon tax - a levy companies must pay when they pollute - or through an emissions-trading system (ETS).

An ETS sets a maximum cap on the amount of emissions that a sector, or group of sectors, can produce. It creates ""carbon permits"" for those emissions, which companies can buy for each tonne of CO2 they emit.

Many countries, from Europe and South Korea, to China and Kazakhstan have already launched schemes, of various scope.

More than fifth of global emissions are covered by 46 national carbon-pricing schemes operating today or in the planning stage, as well as 32 regional systems within countries, according to the World Bank.

The biggest of those - the EU carbon market - is preparing for a major overhaul.

Since the European system was launched in 2005, emissions from participating power plants and factories have dropped by 35% – a sharper drop than seen in sectors not covered by the scheme.

""The ETS has proven its efficiency,"" said Frans Timmermans, head of EU climate policy. ""The ETS shows how carbon pricing is a strong driver for immediate change in energy consumption.""

PRICE BALANCING ACT

In the power sector, the scheme helped make coal plants uneconomic, compared with less-polluting gas plants or renewables.

But the trick for these markets is to get the carbon price right. If it's too low, there's little incentive for companies to rein in emissions; too high, and risk knee-capping industry.

The EU, seeking steeper emissions reductions to meet its new 2030 climate targets, will propose to expand and reform its ETS from next year.

The changes would involve including more sectors, such as shipping, and curbing the free permits given to EU industry to help it compete with overseas companies that don't pay carbon costs.

The carbon price – currently at around 27 euros price per tonne of CO2 - needs to hit levels that push industry toward investing in emissions-cutting technologies like hydrogen, analysts say.

""The carbon price has to reach high enough to enable the European Union to reach net zero by 2050,"" said Mark Lewis, Chief Sustainability Strategist at BNP Paribas (PA: ).

""On this basis, I think around 90 euros a tonne is a reasonable expectation by 2030,"" he said.

GUARDING AGAINST SHOCKS

Other major economies are catching on. China, now the world's top greenhouse gas emitter, plans to launch its own national ETS, possibly as early as next year. That system would become the world's largest, and is expected to cover several billion tonnes of CO2 from power plants each year.

Experts say China's preparations for launching its ETS have sped up since President Xi Jinping's announcement in September that China would become carbon neutral by 2060.

""There is a sense of urgency that hasn't been seen for quite a long time,"" said Beijing-based lawyer Shawn He, who assists companies with carbon compliance.

The EU has worked with the country on developing carbon-pricing policies for more than a decade, both on the pilot regional markets China is now running and on a national scheme.

Jos Delbeke, a former senior EU climate policymaker who led the development of the bloc's trading scheme, said his advice to China had been to build a system that could gradually be reformed over time and could withstand economic shocks.

The EU learned that lesson after the 2008 financial crisis, when factors including a lack of flexible rules meant the market could not respond to a recession-induced drop in emissions, and became plagued by an oversupply of cheap permits.

The price of carbon permits didn't recover until 2018, when the EU said it would introduce a ""market-stability reserve"" from 2019 which removed excess permits from the system.

China's pilot schemes have already looked at using a similar reserve system, according to Huw Slater, senior carbon consultant with consultancy firm ICF in Beijing.

""It is a little early at the national stage to know whether they will do a similar thing, but it is quite possible.""

CARBON ACROSS BORDERS

Establishing a single, global price on carbon remains a distant prospect, however.

""The idea of a global carbon price was built on the assumption there would be dozens of linked trading systems. That hasn't happened,"" said David Hone, chief climate adviser at oil major Shell (LON: ), which uses an internal carbon price to help meet its own sustainability goals.

Internal carbon prices also help to protect investments from any future carbon-pricing policies.

Talks at the U.N. have failed for two years to agree a common set of rules for international carbon markets.

The lack of global coordination has led the EU to start drafting a carbon border-tax policy - a levy on imports into Europe of polluting goods like steel and cement. The aim is to protect European industry from cheaper imports from regions with lax climate policies.

In the United States, Biden has pledged to do the same, with a $2 trillion plan to cut emissions.

Making access to some of the world's biggest markets conditional on paying a CO2 price should prod countries with weak climate policies ""to begin figuring out how they are going to move in a low-carbon direction to remain competitive"", said the World Bank's Hughes.

""It is possible to create linkages across domestic trading systems,"" she added. ""In the longer term, a global carbon price is desirable ... the fact we don't see one immediately doesn't mean it's not moving in the right direction.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/analysis-carbon-pricing-rises-as-worlds-weapon-of-choice-in-climate-fight-2255931,0.047,0.875,0.078,0.9834

In the power sector, the scheme helped make coal plants uneconomic, compared with less-polluting gas plants or renewables.

But the trick for these markets is to get the carbon price right. If it's too low, there's little incentive for companies to rein in emissions; too high, and risk knee-capping industry.

The EU, seeking steeper emissions reductions to meet its new 2030 climate targets, will propose to expand and reform its ETS from next year.

The changes would involve including more sectors, such as shipping, and curbing the free permits given to EU industry to help it compete with overseas companies that don't pay carbon costs.

The carbon price – currently at around 27 euros price per tonne of CO2 - needs to hit levels that push industry toward investing in emissions-cutting technologies like hydrogen, analysts say.

""The carbon price has to reach high enough to enable the European Union to reach net zero by 2050,"" said Mark Lewis, Chief Sustainability Strategist at BNP Paribas (PA: ).

""On this basis, I think around 90 euros a tonne is a reasonable expectation by 2030,"" he said.

GUARDING AGAINST SHOCKS

Other major economies are catching on. China, now the world's top greenhouse gas emitter, plans to launch its own national ETS, possibly as early as next year. That system would become the world's largest, and is expected to cover several billion tonnes of CO2 from power plants each year.

Experts say China's preparations for launching its ETS have sped up since President Xi Jinping's announcement in September that China would become carbon neutral by 2060.

""There is a sense of urgency that hasn't been seen for quite a long time,"" said Beijing-based lawyer Shawn He, who assists companies with carbon compliance.

The EU has worked with the country on developing carbon-pricing policies for more than a decade, both on the pilot regional markets China is now running and on a national scheme.

Jos Delbeke, a former senior EU climate policymaker who led the development of the bloc's trading scheme, said his advice to China had been to build a system that could gradually be reformed over time and could withstand economic shocks.

The EU learned that lesson after the 2008 financial crisis, when factors including a lack of flexible rules meant the market could not respond to a recession-induced drop in emissions, and became plagued by an oversupply of cheap permits.

The price of carbon permits didn't recover until 2018, when the EU said it would introduce a ""market-stability reserve"" from 2019 which removed excess permits from the system.

China's pilot schemes have already looked at using a similar reserve system, according to Huw Slater, senior carbon consultant with consultancy firm ICF in Beijing.

""It is a little early at the national stage to know whether they will do a similar thing, but it is quite possible.""

CARBON ACROSS BORDERS

Establishing a single, global price on carbon remains a distant prospect, however.

""The idea of a global carbon price was built on the assumption there would be dozens of linked trading systems. That hasn't happened,"" said David Hone, chief climate adviser at oil major Shell (LON: ), which uses an internal carbon price to help meet its own sustainability goals.

Internal carbon prices also help to protect investments from any future carbon-pricing policies.

Talks at the U.N. have failed for two years to agree a common set of rules for international carbon markets.

The lack of global coordination has led the EU to start drafting a carbon border-tax policy - a levy on imports into Europe of polluting goods like steel and cement. The aim is to protect European industry from cheaper imports from regions with lax climate policies.

In the United States, Biden has pledged to do the same, with a $2 trillion plan to cut emissions.

Making access to some of the world's biggest markets conditional on paying a CO2 price should prod countries with weak climate policies ""to begin figuring out how they are going to move in a low-carbon direction to remain competitive"", said the World Bank's Hughes.

""It is possible to create linkages across domestic trading systems,"" she added. ""In the longer term, a global carbon price is desirable ... the fact we don't see one immediately doesn't mean it's not moving in the right direction.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/analysis-carbon-pricing-rises-as-worlds-weapon-of-choice-in-climate-fight-2255931#comments,0.047,0.875,0.078,0.9834

By Matthew Green and Simon Jessop

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are pushing major European companies to make sure the ""missing"" costs of climate change are properly reflected in their financial statements, a move that could wipe billions of dollars off the value of sectors from energy to aviation.

The European and U.S. investors, who manage $9 trillion in assets, have sent 36 carbon-heavy companies a document https://www.iigcc.org/download/investor-expectations-for-paris-aligned-accounts/?wpdmdl=4001&masterkey=5fabc4d15595d setting out how they should account for the likely impact of the 2015 Paris climate accord on their future profits.

The investors suspect that existing balance sheets rest on assumptions over variables such as oil prices, carbon taxes, and the lifespan of fossil fuel assets that are incompatible with a shift to net-zero carbon emissions under the Paris deal.

JPM Morgan Asset Management (part of JP Morgan Chase & Co (N: )), DWS (DE: ), Fidelity International and M&G Investments (L: ) were among 38 asset managers to back the document, according to a copy of an accompanying letter https://www.iigcc.org/download/iigcc-letter-to-european-companies-on-paris-aligned-accounts/?wpdmdl=4006&masterkey=5fabc9c5af24f shared with Reuters by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, an industry coalition.

In a statement published on Monday, the investors called on the companies to ""address missing climate change costs in financial accounts"".

""Either we get serious and start shifting capital flows towards activities aligned with the Paris Agreement, or we continue to talk about it,"" said Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at London-based asset manager Sarasin & Partners, who wrote the 23-page investor expectations document.

""Paris-aligned accounts are amongst the most important changes that will drive system-wide capital redeployment,"" Landell-Mills said.

Among the companies the investors wrote to were Germany's E.ON (DE: ) and Uniper (DE: ), Spain's Iberdrola (MC: ) and Endesa (MC: ), France's Air Liquide (PA: ), Austria's OMV (VI: ) and London-listed Anglo American (L: ).

When contacted for comment, the companies variously referred Reuters to existing commitments on sustainability and climate risk disclosure, emphasised they welcomed investor engagement, and said they needed time to study the requirements.

ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS

The campaign builds on a previous initiative led by Landell-Mills and an initial core of investors to challenge European oil majors and their auditors over their accounting assumptions in light of the Paris deal.

Landell-Mills said that engagement was vindicated in June when British major BP (L: ) said it would write off up to $17.5 billion from the value of its assets after revising down its long-term oil and gas price forecasts. Anglo-Dutch rival Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and France's Total (PA: ) booked smaller impairments.

Regulators have increasingly been encouraging companies to make voluntary disclosures of how they expect climate change to affect their businesses, and some countries, including Britain and New Zealand, are making these mandatory.

But the investors say that accountants and auditors may be failing in their existing legal duties to factor in foreseeable risks linked to both the prospect of rapid decarbonisation and physical impacts from climate change, meaning companies may be overstating their capital.

""Too many company accounts are leaving out material climate-related impacts, and this is not just putting shareholder capital at risk; it could have catastrophic consequences for our planet,"" according to the investors' document.

The document said investors could exert leverage on the issue by engaging directly with audit committees and company boards, by voting out directors and auditors, and by divesting shares.

Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship at the governance advisory arm of Federated Hermes, among the asset managers backing the campaign, said investors would review 2020 accounts for ""clear evidence"" of a response from both board directors and auditors.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/investors-tell-european-firms-to-reveal-missing-climate-costs-in-their-accounts-2251365,0.028,0.894,0.079,0.9681

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's Nyhamna gas export terminal has restarted production and is ramping up output following a shutdown triggered by a strike among workers, system operator Gassco said on Sunday.

Sunday's output loss was expected to amount to 40 million standard cubic metres (mcm) of gas, less than the 50 mcm loss on Saturday, while it was not yet clear if the outage would have any residual impact on Monday.

""Nyhamna has started and currently increasing export. Day ahead impact uncertain,"" Gassco said in a regulatory filing.

British gas prices for the coming week had spiked on Friday ahead of the strike on fears of a protracted conflict.

Gassco and Shell (LON: ), which provides technical service at Nyhamna, late on Saturday said a solution had been found however that allowed the plant to safely restart despite an ongoing strike among security guards.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Hourly employees at Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc’s Convent, Louisiana, refinery, scheduled for permanent closure as early as next week, received details this week of the severance package negotiated by their union and Shell, three people familiar with the agreement said on Friday.

Shell said on Nov. 5 it was closing the refinery after failing to find a buyer for the plant, which has been hit hard by crushed demand in the COVID-19 pandemic. A spokesman did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the agreement.

Shell put the Convent refinery up for sale in July, and was quick to pull the trigger on the closure, the sources said. Shell’s Anacortes, Washington, refinery and Saraland, Alabama, chemical plant, are still operating even though both have been for sale of a longer period of time, the sources said.

The Anacortes refinery has been on the market since at least January.

The United Steelworkers union (USW) and Shell agreed that employees will be paid three weeks for every year of service with a minimum of 12 weeks and a maximum of 78 weeks, the sources said. That offers an extra week of pay per year of service than other refiners which closed plants this year provided, two of the sources said.

About 350 workers are represented by the Steelworkers and can receive the package, they said.

The package for unionized workers is similar to what Shell salaried employees are being offered, they said. The number of salaried and hourly staff is about equal, the sources said. Another 400 contractors work at the Convent refinery.

The dismissed hourly workers can apply for jobs at Shell’s Norco, Louisiana, refinery and Geismar, Louisiana, chemical plant. Some workers will remain to clean up the refinery and some could work at the site into the third quarter of next year, the sources said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) PLC may begin the permanent shutdown of its 211,146 barrel-per-day Convent, Louisiana, refinery early next week, people familiar with plant operations said on Monday.

Shell announced on Nov. 5 the refinery, located 57 miles (92 km) west of New Orleans, was to close after the company failed to find a buyer amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

A Shell spokesman did not reply to a request for comment.

The Convent refinery is first U.S. Gulf Coast refinery to permanently close because of the pandemic-related decline in demand for refined products. Eight other North American plants have been idled or targeted for shutdowns.

The coronavirus pandemic cut fuel demand by up to 30% earlier this year, and even as economies recover the outbreak will likely reduce global demand by 4.7 million barrels per day (bpd) over the next five years, analysts have said.

Three U.S. oil refineries have shut already this year because of weak demand for jet fuel, diesel and gasoline amid a slowing economy.

In August, Calcasieu Refining idled its 135,500-bpd Lake Charles, Louisiana, facility, citing weak margins from falling demand. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE: ) has said it will not restart production at its refineries in Martinez, California, and Gallup, New Mexico.

Shell this month said it will halve its crude processing capacity at its 500,000 bpd Pulau Bukom plant in Singapore over the next three years. Plants in the U.S. and Europe are considering converting some facilities to produce biofuels.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON: )'s female employees in Britain earned 18% less on average than their male colleagues in 2020, with the pay gap slightly narrowing from the previous year.

In its annual UK diversity pay gap report, Shell also published for the first time data on ethnicity which revealed that the average pay and bonuses for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) employees was 8.5% lower than non-BAME staff.

Women represented 34% of the energy company's 6,000-strong British workforce in 2020, mostly due to the prevalence of men on offshore oil and gas facilities. BAME employees made up 21% of the workforce.

The gender pay gap stood at 18.7% in 2019, 18.6% in 2018 and 22.2% in 2017. Shell said it had achieved its ambition to have women in 30% of senior positions in the country.

Gender gap pay is defined as the difference in the average pay and bonuses of all men and women across an organisation.

(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is poised to add chipmaker SMIC and offshore oil-and-gas explorer CNOOC (NYSE: ) to a list of firms blocked from American investment due to military ties, Reuters reported, in the latest U.S. swipe at Beijing before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.

Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Corp. are among four Chinese companies to be added to a list of firms owned or controlled by the military, Reuters reported, citing a document seen and three unidentified people familiar with the matter. Their addition -- along with China Construction Technology Co. Ltd. and China International Engineering Consulting Corp. -- would bring the total number of firms on the blacklist to 35.

It wasn’t clear when the new list would be published in the Federal Register, Reuters said. The Defense Department didn’t respond to Reuters’ request for comment.

CNOOC didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment. Cnooc Ltd., the company’s listed unit, fell as much as 9.3% in Hong Kong. China Oilfield Services Ltd., its drilling subsidiary, fell as much as 11%.

“There will be huge impact on the company because the oil-and-gas value chain involves a lot of U.S. companies from upstream, mid-stream all the way to the gas side,” said Sengyick Tee, an analyst with SIA Energy. “This also means they cannot procure parts and software from U.S. companies.”

President Donald Trump, a Republican, has continued to roll out punitive measures against China despite losing the U.S. presidential election earlier this month to Biden, a Democrat. The actions will make it harder for the incoming administration to de-escalate tensions with Beijing, although they will also arguably give the U.S. side more leverage in future negotiations.

In a related executive order earlier this month, the U.S. said China was “increasingly exploiting” American capital for “the development and modernization of its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses,” posing a threat to the U.S. That order prohibits investment firms and pension funds from buying and selling shares of 31 Chinese companies designated by the Pentagon since June as having military ties.

In response to the previous order, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. of “viciously slandering” its military-civilian integration policies and vowed to protect the country’s companies. “This not only severely harms the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, but also the interests of foreign investors including U.S. ones,” ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at the time, urging the order’s withdrawal.

Exxon, Shell (LON: )

State-owned CNOOC, the country’s main deepwater oil and gas explorer, has ties to key global energy producers and projects. The firm is among Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ).’s partners in its Guyana project, owns a stake in a Royal Dutch Shell Plc LNG export terminal in Australia, and has a share in the U.K. North Sea’s Buzzard oil field.

CNOOC’s main base of operations are the coastal waters surrounding China, which account for more than 60% of its listed company’s production, with the majority coming from the Bohai Sea near Beijing.

Operations in the South China Sea, which account for about 29% of output, have at times run into controversy because China claims drilling rights in waters far from its borders, and within 200 miles of countries like Vietnam and the Philippines. The firm also owns interests in shale and deepwater projects in the U.S., accounting for production of about 67,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, according to its website.

SMIC was little changed after falling as much as 0.9% earlier. A company representative referred request for comment to a prior statement denying military connections.

SMIC Restrictions

In September, the U.S. Commerce Department separately imposed export restrictions on SMIC, requiring American firms to apply for a license to send certain products to China’s largest chipmaker. SMIC and its subsidiaries present “an unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end use,” the department’s Bureau of Industry and Security wrote.

SMIC represents a cornerstone in China’s vision of creating its own, world-class semiconductor industry, which the Communist Party sees as an essential foundation for a self-sufficient technology sector. The company is the country’s biggest contract manufacturer of chipsets and raised more than $7 billion to expand in a Shanghai stock offering in July.

SMIC still has far to go to catch up to rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).’s most advanced smartphones. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, is commercializing 5 nanometer technology, at least two generations ahead of SMIC’s capabilities.

A Trump administration blacklisting would make that effort more difficult -- if not impossible -- because SMIC could be barred from American suppliers, which tend to make the most advanced chip-making equipment.

Investing.com -- Crude oil prices extended their gains on Tuesday as the market continued to reassess the outlook for fuel demand in the wake of an announcement on Monday that encouraged hopes for an early end to the Covid-19 pandemic.

By 9:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), U.S. futures were up 1.5% at $40.88 a barrel, while futures, the international benchmark, were up 1.5% at $43.03 a barrel.

Both, however, were off intraday highs after Brent, notably, failed again to break a familiar resistance level at around $43.55, according to analysts at Saxo Bank.

Prices had soared on Monday after Pfizer (NYSE: ) announced its experimental Covid-19 drug had proved over 90% effective in preventing the coronavirus, citing results from a late-stage trial. Gains moderated as the market absorbed the fact that the vaccine’s safety and longevity still need to be proven.

Newswires quoted Russell Hardy, CEO of leading oil trader Vitol, as telling a conference Tuesday that he now sees oil prices heading back to $50 a barrel, as a recovery in demand leads to a faster drawdown in global inventories. Even so, he said there may be some “difficult months” before then.

Saxo analysts acknowledged that the Pfizer news was a major boost for oil, but noted that “with Covid-19 cases still surging, not least in the U.S. the short-term outlook remains challenging.”

The U.S. recorded its fourth straight day of over 100,000 new infections and surges from California to the Midwest and the Mexican border strongly suggest that the pandemic has veered out of control while the nation has been distracted by the election campaign.

The level at which inventories are being whittled down from their abnormally high levels remains the key variable in the market, with the OPEC+ bloc deliberately producing less than current demand to put pressure on stockpiles. The American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly estimate of U.S. stockpiles at 4:30 PM ET, as usual.

Elsewhere, Bloomberg reported that Chinese inventories had fallen substantially in recent weeks as the domestic economy recovers. That has led to the government increasing private refineries’ import quotas for next year, which will be a net support to global demand. Beijing has also put in place minimum prices for refined products to guarantee refinery margins, at a time when refining margins around the world are under acute pressure. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) said on Monday it would shut its Louisiana refinery after having failed to find a buyer.

Elsewhere later, the U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its regular Short-Term Energy Outlook, the first of three major surveys on the oil market this week.

(Reuters) - Democrat Joe Biden has won the November U.S. presidential election, according to several major networks. Here are some of the changes that could occur in U.S. energy policy under his administration:

INTERNATIONAL OIL SUPPLIES

Biden has shown an interest in multilateral diplomacy similar to previous Democratic administrations. That could mean an eventual path for OPEC members Iran and Venezuela to get out from under Washington’s sanctions and start pumping again, if the right conditions are met.

In Iran, that path could include a partnered approach between Washington and Europe, similar to a deal struck under Obama's administration.

In Venezuela, Biden appears likely to continue to favor sanctions to pressure the regime of President Nicolas Maduro, but could increase diplomatic efforts to end the impasse by negotiating a new election or power-sharing with the opposition.

Outgoing President Donald Trump's unilateral sanctions on the two countries have taken around 3 million barrels per day of off international markets, a little more than 3% of world supply.

Biden's campaign has not detailed how it would approach these issues.

LINE TO OPEC

Biden lacks the chummy rapport that Trump had developed with Saudi Arabia’s defacto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. That country is the biggest voice in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, meaning Biden may not engage as closely on the group’s production policy. He is also more likely to rely on quiet diplomatic channels for influencing OPEC than Trump's Twitter-centered approach.

Biden's campaign has not yet detailed how it would approach these issues, but any influence he would wield as president would likely be in service of the same goal - a moderate oil price. Any U.S. president needs affordable fuel for consumers. And for Biden, the price would need to be high enough to make clean energy alternatives to fossil fuels competitive in support of his ambitious climate plan.

Trump had been more engaged with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries than most of his predecessors. He has sometimes influenced OPEC policy with his tweets and phone calls, arguing for an oil price low enough for consumers but high enough for drillers.

His sanctions also weakened the influence of OPEC hawks Venezuela and Iran within the group, removing two big historical hurdles to a pro-Washington OPEC policy. That concentrated power with leading producer Saudi Arabia, along with Russia, part of the group known as OPEC+.

A GREEN TRANSITION?

A Biden administration would look to re-enter the Paris Climate Agreement, an international pact negotiated during the Obama administration to fight global warming that Trump pulled away from saying it could hurt the U.S. economy.

Biden has also vowed to bring U.S. emissions down to net zero by 2050, including by bringing emissions from the power industry to net zero by 2035 - a goal that will be tricky to accomplish without a Democratic majority in Congress.

Biden's view is that climate change is an existential threat to the planet, and that a transition from fossil fuels can be an economic opportunity if the United States moves fast enough to become a leader in the clean energy technology.

Trump's administration had acted to weaken or eliminate emissions targets, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's softening of vehicle emissions standards, and its rescinding of former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan requiring cuts from the electric power industry. Transport and electricity together make up around half the country’s greenhouse gas emissions.

While European oil and gas companies like BP (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) have already begun implementing strategies for a global energy transition, U.S. majors like Exxon Mobil (N: ) and Chevron (N: ) have remained focused on the traditional energy business - sheltered politically by Trump's leadership in Washington.

FEDERAL DRILLING

While Trump had sought to maximize domestic oil and gas production, Biden has promised to ban issuance of new drilling permits on federal lands and waters in order to fight global climate change.

The United States produced nearly 3 million barrels of crude oil per day from federal lands and waters in 2019, along with 13.2 billion cubic feet per day of , according to Interior Department data.

That amounts to about a quarter of total domestic oil output and more than an eighth of total U.S. production of gas. A federal ban on new permits would mean those numbers trend toward zero over a matter of years.

There would also be an impact on public revenue federal oil and gas production produced about $12 billion in public revenue in 2019, divided between the U.S. Treasury, states and counties, tribes, and cleanup funds.

New Mexico, for example, received $2.4 billion in disbursements last year, much of it going to its historically underfunded education system. The state’s Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham told Reuters this spring she would seek a waiver from Biden’s government to allow continued drilling if he was elected.

Biden’s camp has been mum on whether such a waiver program would exist.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/factbox-how-a-biden-presidency-would-transform-the-us-energy-landscape-2247233,0.057,0.849,0.095,0.9838

LONDON (Reuters) - A lawsuit launched by the Nigerian government against U.S. bank JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: ), claiming over $1.7 billion (1.29 billion pounds) for its role in a disputed 2011 oilfield deal, will proceed to trial, London's high court ruled on Thursday.

The suit filed in the English courts in 2017 relates to the purchase of the offshore OPL 245 oilfield in Nigeria by oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Eni (MI: ) in 2011, which is the subject of an ongoing trial in Milan.

The six-week London trial will start on the first available date after Nov. 1 next year, meaning that proceedings may not begin until 2022.

JP Morgan declined to comment.

Central to the case is a $1.3 billion payment from Shell and Eni to secure the block that was deposited into a Nigerian government escrow account managed by JP Morgan.

As part of the proceedings, JP Morgan will also have to disclose within 21 days which individuals at the bank made the final decision to transfer the funds in question.

""Nigeria is pleased that JP Morgan has agreed it will now confirm all the senior figures at the bank who were involved,"" a spokesman for the Nigerian government on this case said.

""This claim will move forward and Nigeria will hold JP Morgan accountable for its central role in the OPL 245 fraud.""

In the claim, Nigeria alleges JP Morgan was negligent in its decision to transfer the funds in escrow to a company controlled by the country's former oil minister Dan Etete instead of government coffers.

The damages sought include the monies allegedly sent to Etete, around $875 million paid out in three instalments, plus interest taking the total to $1.7 billion.

The decision is also likely to compel the bank to disclose details of its internal processes. JP Morgan sought to quash the case last year.

The Milan trial began in 2018. In July 2020, Italian prosecutors asked a Milan court for Eni and Shell to be fined and some of their present and former executives, including Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi, to be jailed.

They further requested Eni and Shell to be fined 900,000 euros ($1.06 million) each and sought to confiscate a total of $1.092 billion from all the defendants in the case, the equivalent of the bribes alleged to have been paid.

Final defence arguments from lawyers representing Shell, Eni and its executives are being made to the court. The next hearing is scheduled for Nov. 25.

(Bloomberg) -- Oil-rich Abu Dhabi will open a commodities exchange in March to rival those of Middle Eastern neighbors and allow investors to trade its crude using futures contracts for the first time.

The ICE Futures Abu Dhabi exchange will open on March 29 and offer contracts based on the emirate’s flagship Murban crude grade, pending regulatory approvals, Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ) Inc. said in a statement Monday. The Atlanta-based operator of trading and clearing platforms is setting up the exchange with government producer Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. and other oil suppliers.

Abu Dhabi is the capital of and holds most of the oil in the United Arab Emirates, the third-largest producer in OPEC. Murban crude, pumped from onshore fields, makes up more than half the sheikhdom’s crude output, now at around 2.6 million barrels daily.

By selling through futures, Abu Dhabi will let the market determine the price of its . It’s a significant change for a producer that until this year fixed its pricing retroactively, effectively telling buyers the cost of barrels purchased a month earlier.

Adnoc wants Murban futures to serve as a regional benchmark for Gulf barrels heading east. Benchmarks help buyers in Asia, the biggest and fastest-growing oil market, to compare crude from the U.S., Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

Oman and the UAE emirate of Dubai joined with CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ: ) in 2007 to start the Dubai Mercantile Exchange, which trades Omani crude futures. Oman, Dubai and Saudi Arabia price off those contracts. Most other producers in the Persian Gulf -- which pumps about a fifth of the world’s oil -- base their monthly pricing on Dubai and Oman crude-price assessments by S&P Global Platts.

Murban is lighter and contains less sulfur than most Middle Eastern crudes, making it easier to refine. It generally fetches higher prices and is similar in quality to , futures for which are traded on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange.

Vitol Group, BP (NYSE: ) Plc, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Total SE were among the nine oil traders and producers that joined as partners in the planned exchange last year. Adnoc pushed back the start from the first half of last year, initially due to the need for regulatory approvals and then as the coronavirus pandemic upended markets.

crude has doubled since April, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners agreed to cut output to meet plunging demand. But the global benchmark is still down about 39% this year.

(Reuters) - Shell (L: ) said on Thursday it will begin shutting down its 211,146-barrel-per- day refinery in Convent, Louisiana in November, the largest refinery to close as the coronavirus pandemic weighs on demand for fuels.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) will halve crude processing capacity and cut jobs at its Pulau Bukom oil refinery in Singapore as part of an overhaul to reduce the company's carbon dioxide (CO2)emissions to net zero by 2050, it said on Tuesday.

The refinery on Pulau Bukom, a small island in the Southeast Asian city-state, can process 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil and is Shell's largest wholly-owned refinery worldwide.

Shell has launched a broad review of its business aimed at cutting costs as it prepares to restructure its operations by reducing its oil and gas business and expanding its renewable energy and power division.

In September, Shell said it planned to cut up to 9,000 jobs globally, or more than 10% of its workforce.

As part of the plans, Shell is cutting the number of oil refining and petrochemical sites it will keep operating to six from 14. Besides Pulau Bukom, the other sites are in Texas, Louisiana, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada.

""Bukom will pivot from a crude-oil, fuels-based product slate towards new low-carbon value chains. We will reduce our crude processing capacity by about half and aim to deliver a significant reduction in CO2 emissions,"" Shell said.

The company will cut 500 jobs by the end of 2023 at the site, which now employs 1,300 staff, a Shell spokeswoman said.

""We will progressively make changes in our refinery configuration over the next three years,"" she said.

The company announced in August that it would convert its refinery in the Philippines into an import terminal as it was no longer economically viable.

In Singapore, Shell said it was studying the production of products that would still be viable following its energy transition, such as biofuels and specialities like bitumen.

It is also looking at using different raw materials, or feedstocks, such as recycled chemicals. Shell operates a plant at Bukom that produces 800,000 tonnes of ethylene a year.

In Singapore, Shell said it would expand its solar power generation, including utility-scale plants, build electric vehicle charging points, provide carbon-neutral solutions for its customers and study plastic waste recycling.

Shell is also expecting its first bunkering ship for liquefied (LNG) to arrive in Singapore later this year. It will be operated by FueLNG, a joint venture with Keppel Offshore & Marine.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/shell-to-cut-jobs-capacity-at-singapore-oil-refinery-its-largest-globally-2248406,0.05,0.909,0.041,-0.7184

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish wind energy group Iberdrola (MC: ) plans to invest 75 billion euros (67.7 billion pounds) in its renewable energy production, grids and retail operations by 2025 to capitalise on growing global demand for clean power, it said on Thursday.

Countries and companies the world over are seeking to cut emissions to combat climate change, buoying renewables-focused companies including Iberdrola.

Pursuing the opportunities created by the ""energy revolution"" facing the world's major economies should help to boost net profit by more than 40% from 2019 to 5 billion euros in 2025, Iberdrola said.

Shares rose throughout morning trade and were up 3.1% on the day at 1300 GMT, outperforming a positive Spanish stock index ( ) and taking Iberdrola's gains so far this year to around a quarter. It has become Spain's second biggest company after Zara owner Inditex (MC: ).

For years, renewable companies have struggled to generate big profits, while fossil fuels have provided easier margins, but as COVID-19 lockdowns have hobbled energy use and hammered oil and gas markets, the investment focus has been transformed.

Oil and gas companies, including Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), BP (L: ) and Total (PA: ), are moving towards renewable power, but Iberdrola's new spending plan eclipses their combined planned investments in low carbon.

Other utilities are joining Iberdrola in building green capacity and wind energy is set to reach record growth globally over the next five years.

Denmark's Orsted (CO: ) is in the midst of a $30 billion investment plan and Italy-based Enel (MI: ), the region's leader, has set aside 14.4 billion euros to build renewables capacity and phase out coal between 2020 and 2022.

Iberdrola promises steady earnings for its shareholders.

They will receive between 0.40 and 0.44 euros per share by 2025 as the company sets aside a total of 94 billion euros for both the investment plan and its dividend plan, Iberdrola Chief Financial Officer Jose Sainz said.

The money will mainly come from operations and cash management, but 19% will be from taking on debt, Sainz said.

Half the overall investment will be split between the United States, where it announced last month its local unit Avangrid (N: ) would buy utility PNM Resources (N: ), and Britain, where it owns Scottish Power.

At home in Spain, spending, mainly on renewables and networks, will more than double to 14.35 billion euros over the life of the plan.

Iberdrola hopes one costly Spanish project, building capacity to produce hydrogen from renewable sources, will get European Union funds as the bloc seeks to emerge from a coronavirus-induced recession by focusing spending on sustainability.

By 2030 Iberdrola aims to increase solar and onshore wind capacity by 2.5 times and offshore wind power by 4.5 times, to reach a total generation portfolio of 95 gigawatts (GW).",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/iberdrola-to-invest-67-billion-in-energy-revolution-by-2025-2246057,0.031,0.874,0.095,0.9806

(Reuters) - London stocks rose on Thursday after the government and Bank of England both ramped up stimulus programmes to cushion the struggling economy as England goes into a second national lockdown.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index ( ) closed 0.4% up, with shares in insurer RSA Insurance Group Plc (L: ) surging 45.7% after it reported a rise in underwriting profit and said pandemic-related exclusions would limit lockdown impacts.

The domestically focused mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) ended 0.7% higher after finance minister Rishi Sunak extended the government's costly coronavirus furlough scheme until the end of March and announced billions of pounds in other forms of support.

Earlier on Thursday, the BoE expanded its already huge asset purchase programme by a further 150 billion pounds helping the government to fund the surge in public spending.

""Today's announcements are vital steps to shelter the UK economy through a difficult winter. The extension of the furlough scheme will help provide a much needed bridge for households and businesses until the economy can reopen,"" said Ambrose Crofton, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

""However, the risk remains that for many businesses, faced with the uncertainty of how long this crisis may last, they may decide to make lasting decisions to either cut jobs or cease trading.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Most company accounts are not meeting the needs of investors in factoring in the related risks of climate change, Britain's audit watchdog has told the boards of British firms.

The Financial Reporting Council said in the letter published on Thursday that it expects them to do a better job of assessing areas such as the impact on asset impairments and fair value.

Some financial statements did not mention climate change even though narrative reporting elsewhere in a company's annual report suggested it could be having ""a significant impact on key financial statement assumptions"", the FRC said.

The move follows a campaign by some investors to push companies including oil majors BP (LON: ) and Shell (LON: ) to better reflect climate risk in their accounts.

Ahead of the next reports from companies the FRC said that where relevant financial statements should show how climate risk impacted key assumptions and disclosures.

As well as how climate impacts the impairment of individual assets and cash generating units, their fair value and likely useful economic life, other key data could include the potential scale and timeline for provisions.

Among other issues, the FRC said it also wanted companies to describe the impact of their businesses on the environment, including their supply chains - a key focus for investors as they look to manage climate risk in their portfolios.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/uk-watchdog-says-accounts-dont-meet-investor-needs-on-climate-risk-2250055,0.039,0.862,0.099,0.93

By Ron Bousso

LONDON (Reuters) -Shell is set to conclude nearly a century of operations in Nigerian onshore oil and gas after agreeing to sell its subsidiary there to a consortium of five mostly local companies for up to $2.4 billion.

The British energy giant pioneered Nigeria's oil and gas business beginning in the 1930s. It has struggled for years with hundreds of onshore oil spills as a result of theft, sabotage and operational issues that led to costly repairs and high-profile lawsuits.

Since 2021, Shell (LON: ) has sought to sell its Nigerian oil and gas business, but will remain active in Nigeria's more lucrative and less problematic offshore sector.

Shell's exit is part of a broader retreat by western energy companies from Nigeria as they focus on newer, more profitable operations. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), Italy's Eni and Norway's Equinor have struck deals to sell assets in the country in recent years.

The British major will sell The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) for a consideration of $1.3 billion, it said in a statement, while the buyers will make an additional payment of up to $1.1 billion relating to prior receivables at completion.

""This agreement marks an important milestone for Shell in Nigeria, aligning with our previously announced intent to exit onshore oil production in the Niger Delta, simplifying our portfolio and focusing future disciplined investment in Nigeria on our Deepwater and Integrated Gas positions,"" Shell head of upstream Zoë Yujnovich said.

The buyer, the Renaissance consortium comprises ND Western, Aradel Energy, First E&P, Waltersmith, all local oil exploration and production companies, and Petrolin, a Swiss-based trading and investment company.

The sale, which Renaissance confirmed, requires the approval of the Nigerian government.

SPILLS AND LAWSUITS

Renaissance will take over the responsibility for dealing with spills, theft and sabotage, said Shell, which has faced in recent years multiple lawsuits for compensation over damage caused as a result of spills in the Niger delta.

Nnimmo Bassey, Executive Director of Nigerian advocacy group Health of Mother Earth Foundation said: ""Shell must own up to its responsibility.""

""This means full payment for the remediation and restoration of the polluted areas as well as reparations to the host communities. They cannot walk away from the virtually irreparable harm they have caused,"" Bassey said in a statement.

Shell's SPDC Limited operates and has a 30% stake in the SPDC joint venture that holds 18 onshore and shallow water mining leases. Shell's resources in SPDC reached around 458 million barrels of oil equivalent by the end of 2022.

Other partners in the joint venture are the state's Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which holds 55%, TotalEnergies (LON: ), with 10% and Italy's Eni with 5%.

Apart from its operations and stakes in several fields deep offshore, Shell still has a liquefied plant and other assets in Nigeria.

SPDC, which remains the operator, was formed in 1979, incorporating assets of the older Shell-BP consortium, with its current partners entering at later stages.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/shell-agrees-to-sell-its-nigeria-onshore-oil-and-gas-business-3298980,0.078,0.843,0.079,-0.2073

Inflation remains above the central bank’s 2% target, but has dropped sharply from the 41-year high of 11.1% seen in October 2022, and thus policymakers could use this occasion to suggest that they are tentatively moving towards cutting interest rates.

The kept interest rates unchanged late Wednesday, but Chairman downplayed any hopes of early cuts, saying inflation is still running above the Fed's target and this would likely prevent policymakers from lowering rates at its next meeting in March.

Russ Mould at AJ Bell notes a ""strong showing from heavyweight oil stocks has helped make up for weakness elsewhere.”

“Oil prices advanced thanks to a renewed escalation in Middle East tensions, with a further attack on shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels and three US soldiers killed in a drone attack on a US service base on the border of Jordan and Syria,"" he explained.

Howeverm he pointed out that crude hitting its highest level since November ""feels ominous given it adds inflationary pressure at a time when borrowers and the markets are hoping to see interest rates cut.""

""Geopolitical factors seem to be propping up oil at a time when the wider dynamics of supply and demand look less than favourable for the energy market,"" he added.

Proactive Investors - Rachel Reeves, the Labour shadow chancellor, declared she and her party will ""unashamedly champion"" the UK's financial services sector.

Ahead of a general election this year, her comments mark a pivot from Labour's previously strained interactions with the financial industry in past leaderships.

Heavily influenced by advice from City veterans, Labour seeks to streamline regulation, leverage technological advancements like artificial intelligence (AI), and solidify the UK's position on the global financial stage.

Reeves is set to launch Labour’s plans for the City and financial services on Thursday at a business event expected to be attended by leaders from companies such as AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ) and Shell (LON: ).

Notably, the strategy stops short of proposing any drastic political changes, reflecting an understanding of the sector's desire for stability post-Brexit.

“The last thing we need is a massive upheaval,” said a Reeves supporter. “Rachel recognises that stability and security are needed.”

Under the plans, Labour would welcome Conservative changes such as Jeremy Hunt’s Edinburgh reforms and the changes to the Solvency II regime.

“Too often in the last decade, British politicians have sounded embarrassed about the sectors we excel in… That will change with Labour,” Reeves said.

Additionally, the plans will tackle regulating 'buy now pay later' (BNPL) schemes, a review of City regulation, building relationships with the EU and the rollout of ‘banking hubs’ for free access to financial services, according to reports.

Sharecast - The was steady at 7,684.18.

Investors were mulling the released overnight. They showed that officials saw rate cuts as likely this year but didn't give any details on when the central bank might start to loosen monetary policy.

Market participants were also digesting the latest data out of China, where the rose to 52.9 in December from 51.5 in November. This was above consensus expectations of 51.6 and marked the highest level since July. A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, while a reading below signals contraction.

Overall new orders rose 2.5 points to 53.7 - the highest since May - while the index for new export orders was up 0.7 points to 52.2.

On home shores, a survey out earlier showed that activity in the UK service sector rose at the fastest pace in six months in December.

The S&P Global/CIPS business activity index increased to 53.4 from 50.9 in December, coming in above the flash reading of 52.7.

Meanwhile, the final - which measures activity in both the service and manufacturing sector - came in at 52.1 in December, up from 50.7 the month before. This also marked the highest level since last June and was above the flash estimate of 51.7.

Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""December data indicated that the UK service sector ended last year on a high, with business activity growth accelerating to its fastest for six months as the turnaround in order books gained momentum. The recovery in client demand was attributed to hopes of lower borrowing costs and an improving global economic backdrop in 2024. However, many firms continued to cite challenging underlying business conditions due to the stagnating UK economy and strong pressure on margins from rising labour costs.

""Business activity expectations for the year ahead are now the most upbeat since last May, supported by signs of a rebound in clients' appetite to spend. Staff hiring was the main weak spot in December, with hiring freezes yet to be lifted as service providers sought to maintain a tight grip on headcount.""

Separate data released by the Bank of England showed that mortgage approvals rose more than expected in November, to their highest in five months as interest rate projections began to fall.

Net approvals for house purchases, a key indicator of future borrowing, totalled 50,100 in November, up from 47,900 in October and the highest level since June. This was ahead of the consensus estimate of 48,500.

Meanwhile, net approvals for remortgaging, which only include remortgaging with a different lender, increased from 24,000 to 27,000.

In equity markets, fashion retailer Next (LON: ) rallied as it lifted annual guidance after better-than-expected full-price sales during November and December. Full-price sales in the nine weeks to December 30 rose 5.7% year-on-year, £38m better than previous guidance of a 2% rise.

Annual pre-tax profit was lifted £20m to £905m. Of that, £17m came from the sales beat to date and £3m from an upgraded forecast for full-price sales in January.

Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""In all, Next has shown its mettle once more in a famously competitive environment, in which it is seen as something of a linchpin. Its share price performance has also defied the odds which tend to follow the retail sector, having risen by 35% over the last year, as compared to a gain of just 1.3% for the wider FTSE 100.

""The warm initial price reaction to the update could initiate some upgrades to a market consensus which has yet to break out of its range for a sustained period of time. Indeed, the general view of the shares as a hold, albeit a strong one, has tended to underestimate the strides which the company has been making.""

BP (LON: ) and Shell (LON: ) gushed higher as oil prices rose amid growing tensions in the Middle East.

Going the other way, JD Sports (LON: ) tumbled as it delivered a profit warning after second-half trading missed expectations due to milder autumn weather and heavier discounting over the peak holiday shopping season.

The company said the ""elevated level of promotional activity"" during the peak trading period meant that full-year gross margins would be slightly lower than last year, leading it to cut adjusted pre-tax profit guidance to between £915m and £935m, from £1.04bn at the half-year stage.

Sports Direct (LON: ) owner Frasers Group also lost ground.

Tullow Oil (LON: ) was on the back foot after a downgrade to ‘underperform’ from ‘hold’ at Jefferies.

Big Yellow, Dr Martens (LON: ) and Workspace (LON: ) were in the red as they traded without entitlement to the dividend.

""We now believe the inflection of fundamentals will take longer to come through, leading us to cut our estimates (by circa 30% at EPS for FY24/25E),"" GS said.

On the upside, Rightmove (LON: ) rallied after it lifted its full-year forecast for annual revenue per advertiser as it hailed strong demand for its products since it last reported. The company now expects ARPA growth to be between £112 and £116, up from previous guidance of £103 to £105.

West End landlord Shaftesbury Capital was also in the black as it hailed a ""strong"" start to the Christmas trading, with footfall high and sales tracking above the prior year. The company said customers reported sales up 12% on 2022 levels and 16% above 2019 levels.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Shell (LON: ) Plc has made a final investment decision to build a gas supply facility in Nigeria to feed a fertiliser plant owned by Africa's richest man Aliko Dangote, the company said in a statement.

The new facility will supply 100 million standard cubic feet of gas per day from the Iseni field to the Dangote Fertiliser and Petrochemical plant for 10 years, according to the deal agreed by Shell and its joint venture partners TotalEnergies (LON: ), Eni and the state oil firm NNPC Ltd.

The $2.5 billion plant, Africa's largest urea complex with a 3-million-tonne output per year, accounts for 65% of Nigeria's fertiliser needs and can supply all the major markets in the sub-region.

""The agreement is a critical step in pursuing the development of the gas-rich Iseni field, which is part of the Okpokunou Cluster in Oil Mining Lease 35"" in the oil-rich Bayelsa state, Shell's Nigeria chief, Osagie Okunbor, said in an email.

Nigeria holds Africa's largest gas reserves of more than 200 trillion cubic feet and is seeking to develop the reserves to boost supply to industries, power plants, and for exports.

Okunbor said the project will increase the delivery of gas to the domestic market and help stimulate economic growth.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-agrees-to-develop-nigeria-gas-field-for-dangote-fertiliser-3323200,0.009,0.91,0.081,0.9485

LONDON (Reuters) - Amsterdam-listed shares in energy company Shell (LON: ) hit their highest in over two decades in early trading on Wednesday.

At 0718 GMT the shares were 0.7% higher, having earlier risen as much as 1.2% to 31.62 euros ($33.54), their highest level since late 2001. Shell's London-listed shares were up 0.7% on the day, having hit their highest since mid-2019 earlier in the day.

The oil price, which surged by the most in one day since April on Monday after fighting erupted in Israel, has risen 2.5% so far this year, but at around $88 a barrel, is not far off its highest in 11 months.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Sixty percent of British firms feel that a slowing Chinese economy presents a bigger challenge to their operations in the Asian giant than strict COVID curbs in place until late last year, according to the British Chamber of Commerce in China.

While the ""peak pessimism"" recorded during the pandemic is easing, British businesses are delaying making new investment in China amid a stuttering economic recovery and are downgrading the importance of the world's No. 2 economy to their global operations, the chamber's annual sentiment survey released on Tuesday showed.

Foreign investors have been sour on China for most of this year due to factors such as a weaker-than-expected post-pandemic recovery, a series of office raids by Chinese authorities, cash-strapped local governments offering fewer investment incentives and higher investment yields in the United States.

""In previous years, 80% (of firms) were investing more because of market potential, but it feels like we're now entering a phase of real clarity,"" Julian Fisher, the chamber's chair said.

""(Firms) are a lot more pragmatic and there's a lot less speculation,"" he added.

AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ), BP (LON: ), Jaguar Land Rover and Shell (LON: ) are some of the chamber's members.

The chamber's findings, based on members' views over October and November, revealed that 60% of companies felt that doing business in China had become more difficult over the past year, with 78% of such firms blaming economic factors.

""(British) companies in China are effectively treading water, with many delaying key decisions around investment and market entry,"" the report read.

Over half the companies surveyed said geopolitics was also making it harder to operate in China, while 43% of firms were struggling with regulatory issues such as licence acquisition.

Foreign direct investment into China has slowed substantially since the country abandoned its strict COVID-19 curbs late last year, leading the country to record its first-ever quarterly deficit in foreign direct investment over July-September, suggesting capital outflow pressure.

The chamber said that while ""British businesses are experiencing a slow return in optimism,"" a trend in which firms are downgrading China's importance to their global operations ""appears to be stabilising.""

Just under half of the surveyed companies listed China as a ""medium priority"" or ""low priority,"" with only 40% of firms recording it as a ""high priority."" In comparison, fifty nine percent of companies saw China as a ""high priority"" over 2021-2022.

Trade between the UK and China was worth 111 billion pounds ($140 billion) last year, according to the British National Bureau of Statistics, making China the UK's fourth largest trading partner.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/uk-companies-pause-china-investment-decisions-as-economy-slows-survey-shows-3266316,0.06,0.899,0.042,-0.9009

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Shell is considering a sale of its Singapore refining and petrochemical plants as part of a broader strategic review and has hired investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) to explore a potential deal, said several sources close to the matter.

The global energy major's new CEO, Wael Sawan, is targeting spending cuts over the next two years to boost profitability while remaining committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.

Those efforts include the review of energy and chemicals assets on Singapore's Bukom and Jurong islands, announced in June, as the group seeks to repurpose its energy and chemical parks globally to offer more low-carbon solutions to customers.

""Our strategic review is ongoing and we are exploring several options including divestment,"" a Shell (LON: ) spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday.

Singapore's position as a regional trading and marketing hub remains important, she added.

Companies that are reviewing Shell's Singapore assets include Asia's largest refiner, China's Sinopec, as well as global trading companies Vitol and Trafigura, the sources said.

For trading companies, the site is seen as a potential oil storage and distribution hub, some of the sources said.

Goldman Sachs, Sinopec, Trafigura and Vitol declined to comment.

The Bukom refinery, Shell's only wholly owned refining and petrochemicals centre in Asia, can process 237,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude. Built in 1961, it was Singapore's first refinery.

The complex also houses a 1 million metric tons per year (tpy) ethylene cracker and a 155,000 tpy butadiene extraction unit. These are integrated with a monoethylene glycol (MEG) plant at Shell’s petrochemicals site on Jurong Island.

In March, Shell decided not to proceed with two projects it was studying to produce biofuels and base oils in Singapore.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/exclusiveshell-taps-goldman-sachs-to-explore-singapore-refinery-sale-sources-3132312,0.016,0.915,0.069,0.9149

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shell (LON: ) and Trinidad and Tobago's National Gas Company (NGC) are close to agreeing to credit Venezuela's state-run oil firm for its $1 billion investment in a gas field the three want to jointly develop, four people close to the discussions said.

If agreed, the move could help speed a long-stalled offshore development. The U.S. in January granted Venezuela's PDVSA, Shell and NGC a two-year authorization to revive the project, which could boost Trinidad and Tobago's gas processing and exports.

Negotiations between the trio initially had progressed little over a U.S. demand that the proposed Dragon gas project exclude cash payments to Venezuela or its state companies. That remains a hurdle, though Trinidad has asked the Biden administration to reconsider.

Much of the $1 billion that Venezuela wants recognized as its contribution belongs to a nearly-completed gas line connecting the offshore field to Venezuela's shore, two of the people said. The field is in Venezuelan waters and past efforts to find partners for its development stumbled over PDVSA's demands for compensation.

Shell and NGC have not given final word to PDVSA on the reimbursement, but are prepared to pay for ""all legitimate claims,"" one of the sources said.

PDVSA in 2013 finished testing gas output at Dragon, whose reserves it estimated at 4.2 trillion cubic feet. But the field has never been commercially active due to Venezuela's lack of capital and, more recently, U.S sanctions.

Shell and NGC confirmed the parties are holding negotiations, but declined to elaborate.

""Discussions on the Dragon project involving the governments of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago and Shell are ongoing and commercially confidential,"" Shell told Reuters.

Trinidad's Energy Minister Stuart Young met Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro last week, the Venezuelan government said on social media.

PDVSA, Venezuela's oil ministry and Trinidad's energy ministry did not reply to requests for comment. The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson said its overall Venezuela sanctions policy remains in place to limit revenue flows to Maduro with the goal of ""encouraging a return to democracy in Venezuela.""

SHOW ME THE MONEY

Trinidad's Prime Minister Keith Rowley in January suggested it could pay for the gas in humanitarian goods, including food and medicine.

Venezuela, however, has insisted it will not accept any deal exclusively based on barter, the sources said.

""PDVSA has said they want part of the payment for the gas in cash and the other part in kind,"" a sources said.

In May, Trinidad's government asked U.S. officials to amend some license terms related to Dragon's expected proceeds.

But Washington has remained reluctant to consider any license changes until there is further progress in negotiations, another person said.

Under the terms agreed to date, Shell would become field operator with NGC and PDVSA holding equity stakes. PDVSA, which holds a license issued by Venezuela for development, would bring in Shell and NGC as partners under that authorization.

The parties are considering two separate gas lines: A line now partially built to transport PDVSA's portion of the gas to Guiria, on Venezuela's eastern coast. A second could connect to Shell's Hibiscus field on Trinidad's side, allowing gas to flow to Trinidad, the people said.

Venezuela also has suggested that all the gas pass through Guiria, so only an additional short pipeline would be needed to link Guiria to Point Fortin, home of Trinidad's liquefied export plants.

That option would allow PDVSA to transport and process the gas on Venezuela's shore, keeping what it needs to supply the domestic market and exporting gas liquids that could be produced in future project stages.

However, the other parties have not preferred that option, the people said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusiveshell-trinidad-weigh-venezuelas-natural-gas-investment-demands-3143828,0.024,0.905,0.071,0.9818

JPMorgan (NYSE: ) has recently upgraded its rating on global energy stocks from Neutral to Overweight, predicting a supply-demand gap after 2025 and improving sector fundamentals. The bank anticipates that major companies will outperform midcaps and has upgraded Eni to Overweight while maintaining Overweight on Shell (LON: ), TotalEnergies (EPA: ), and Neste. Repsol (OTC: ) was also lifted to Neutral.

Analysts led by Christyan Malek suggest the sector is experiencing a structural up-cycle, with oil prices and energy equities expected to fluctuate within a wider range. This reflects an effective higher weighted average cost of capital due to increased price volatility and concerns around environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues and peak demand.

The analysts argue against peak demand fears within their investment horizon through 2030, citing the immaturity of the clean energy system in catering to end customers effectively. They warn that without an increase in oil and gas capital expenditure (capex), there's a risk of energy deficits and significant inflation across commodities. This situation could potentially lead to severe oil-led energy crises this decade, which could be worse than Europe's gas crisis in 2022.

Interestingly, the analysts do not view oil prices in the $100-to-$120 range as destructive to demand, as it would still represent less than 4% of the world economy. They believe this situation could bolster OPEC's control over the global oil market and help regulate sharp price fluctuations.

Key stocks expected to outperform on a global scale include Eni, Shell, TotalEnergies, Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL: ), Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), Marathon Petroleum (NYSE: ), Tenaris, Baker Hughes, Cenovus, Prio, PetroChina, Beach Energy (OTC: ), and Ampol. Despite a 30% surge in oil prices recently, European energy stocks have only seen a 10% increase.

In other market movements, European stocks were adjusting to Wall Street's sharp decline on Thursday, with the U.K.'s remaining steady, while and 40 experienced decreases. Ubisoft Entertainment shares increased by 4% following provisional approval from the U.K. competition regulator for the Microsoft-Activision deal, which would grant the French video games maker cloud rights to Activision games.

Benzinga - by Benzinga Insights, Benzinga Staff Writer. Shell's (NYSE:SHEL) short percent of float has fallen 44.44% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 3.44 million shares sold short, which is 0.1% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 1.0 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Shell Short Interest Graph (3 Months)

As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Shell has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.

Comparing Shell's Short Interest Against Its Peers Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.

According to Benzinga Pro, Shell's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 1.69%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.

Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.

Investing.com -- Shell PLC's (AS: ) first quarter gas trading will resemble the posted in the final three months of 2022, the oil major said in an update on Thursday.

In the statement, Europe's biggest oil and gas company predicted that trading and optimization at its key integrated gas division would be ""at a similar level"" compared to the fourth quarter.

Shell also forecast that quarterly production at the unit would be in the range of 930,000 to 970,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from 917,000 in the prior three months.

Integrated gas, which includes the world's largest trading operations, reported $6 billion in adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter, thanks largely to soaring energy prices caused by the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.

These prices have since moderated from the surges seen in 2022, although both and benchmarks have gained this week following a surprise decision by OPEC and its allies - including Russia - to slash output.

Analysts at RBC said the statement looked ""positive overall"" for Shell given concerns over the impact of weaker gas prices on the 115-year-old business.

LONDON (Reuters) -Shell said on Thursday it is seeking partners to invest in renewable assets developed and operated by its Indian business Sprng Energy as part of CEO Wael Sawan's effort to boost profits.

Sprng, which Shell (LON: ) acquired from Actis in August 2022 for $1.55 billion, develops and supplies solar and wind power to electricity distribution companies in India, seen as a major growth market in the power sector in the coming decades.

""We continue to develop new projects (of the Sprng Energy group) while exploring partnering opportunities with investors who want to deploy capital on de-risked operational assets, with Shell retaining a stake in such assets,"" Shell said in a statement to Reuters.

""This focus on capital discipline will enable Shell to further accelerate growth of our renewables portfolio.""

The move is part of Sawan's plan to boost Shell's performance and returns, which includes doubling down on oil and gas operations and scaling back some investments in renewables.

Shell has in recent months sold its UK power retail business, placed two refineries in Singapore and Germany under strategic review, and pulled out of several low-carbon projects.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Oil and gas major Shell (LON: ) plans to put Germany's sonnen up for sale, German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Thursday, with the solar storage manufacturer saying it had no comment but was focused on pursuing global growth of its business.

Shell paid around 500 million euros ($536 million) for sonnen four years ago, but like its rivals has had to grapple with falling retail profit margins as wholesale energy prices have risen exceptionally following last year's supply crisis.

Last week, Shell said that it would sell its home energy retail business in the UK and Germany to British energy supplier Octopus Energy Group.

Handelsblatt's report cited several people familiar with the matter as saying sonnen could be valued at 1.35 to 1.8 billion euros, which is three to four times its expected 2023 sales of 450 million euros.

Spokespeople for Shell and sonnen declined to comment.

""Please understand that we will not comment on reports about Shell's business deals. In principle, sonnen is continuing its global growth course in the rapidly expanding storage market,"" a sonnen spokesperson said.

Sonnen, which provides storage batteries for rooftop solar systems, said last month that it has connected 25,000 homes to the grid, amassing 250 megawatt hours (MWh) of capacity in a latest milestone for the digital, renewable power community it is building up amongst its customers.

While 250 MWh is a tiny fraction of the power demand in Western countries, it puts sonnen in the top league of European electricity storage providers.

(Bloomberg) -- One morning in early June, a fire broke out at an obscure facility in Texas that takes from US shale basins, chills it into a liquid and ships it overseas. It was extinguished in 40 minutes or so. No one was injured.

It sounds like a story for the local press, at most — except that more than three weeks later, financial and political shockwaves are still reverberating across Europe, Asia and beyond.

That’s because natural gas is the hottest commodity in the world right now. It’s a key driver of global inflation, posting price jumps that are extreme even by the standards of today’s turbulent markets — some 700% in Europe since the start of last year, pushing the continent to the brink of recession. It’s at the heart of a dawning era of confrontation between the great powers, one so intense that in capitals across the West, plans to fight climate change are getting relegated to the back-burner.

In short, natural gas now rivals oil as the fuel that shapes geopolitics. And there isn’t enough of it to go around.

It’s the war in Ukraine that catalyzed the gas crisis to a new level, by taking out a crucial chunk of supply. Russia is cutting back on pipeline deliveries to Europe — which says it wants to stop buying from Moscow anyway, if not quite yet. The scramble to fill that gap is turning into a worldwide stampede, as countries race to secure scarce cargoes of liquefied natural gas ahead of the northern-hemisphere winter.

The New Oil?

Germany says gas shortfalls could trigger a Lehman Brothers-like collapse, as Europe’s economic powerhouse faces the unprecedented prospect of businesses and consumers running out of power. The main Nord Stream pipeline that carries Russian gas to Germany is due to shut down on July 11 for ten days of maintenance, and there’s growing fear that Moscow may not reopen it. Group of Seven leaders are seeking ways to curb Russia’s gas earnings, which help finance the invasion of Ukraine — and backing new LNG investments. And poorer countries that built energy systems around cheap gas are now struggling to afford it.

“This is the 1970s for natural gas,” says Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners LLC, a Washington-based research firm. “The world is now thinking about gas as it once thought about oil, and the essential role that gas plays in modern economies and the need for secure and diverse supply have become very visible.”

Natural gas used to be a sleepy commodity that changed hands in fragmented regional markets. Now, even though globalization appears to be in retreat across much of the world economy, the gas trade is headed in the opposite direction. It’s globalizing fast — but maybe not fast enough.

Many countries have turned to natural gas as part of a transition to cleaner energy, as they seek to phase out use of dirtier fossil fuels like coal and in some cases nuclear power too. Major producers — like the US, which has quickly risen up the ranks of LNG exporters to rival Qatar as the world’s biggest — are seeing surging demand for their output. Forty-four countries imported LNG last year, almost twice as many as a decade ago. But the fuel is much harder to shift around the planet than oil, because it has to be liquefied at places like the Freeport plant in Texas.

And that’s why a minor explosion at a facility seen as nothing special by industry insiders — it’s not the biggest or most sophisticated of the seven terminals that send LNG from American shores – had such an outsized impact.

‘The Current Crisis’

Gas prices in and Asia surged more than 60% in the weeks since Freeport was forced to temporarily shut down, a period that’s also seen further supply cuts by Russia. In the US, by contrast, prices for the fuel plunged almost 40% — because the outage means more of the gas will remain available for domestic use.

There were already plenty of signs of extreme tightness in the market. War and Covid may be roiling every commodity from wheat to aluminum and zinc, but little compares to the stomach-churning volatility of global gas prices. In Asia, the fuel is now about three times as expensive as a year ago. In Europe, it’s one of the main reasons why inflation just hit a fresh record.

Natural gas remains cheaper in the US — but even there, futures had more than doubled this year before the Freeport shutdown. With key political allies from Germany to Ukraine desperate to buy American gas, US manufacturers warn that more sales abroad will mean higher costs at home. The market reaction to the Freeport fire illustrates a “clear connection between LNG exports and the inflationary impacts to domestic prices for natural gas and electricity,” says Paul Cicio, president of the Industrial Energy Consumers of America.To meet all the new demand will require a massive wave of investment in supply. That’s already under way, and it got a boost at last week’s meeting of the Western world’s biggest economies, where G-7 leaders vowed to back public investments in gas projects — saying they’re “necessary in response to the current crisis.”

Among the urgent infrastructure needs:

Export facilities: The rush for LNG is accelerating projects in North America and beyond. Last month, Cheniere Energy (NYSE: ) greenlighted a terminal expansion in Texas. In April, a Canadian LNG project backed by Indonesian tycoon Sukanto Tanoto got the go-ahead to begin construction. In Qatar, Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: ) and Shell (AS: ) are among energy giants with stakes in a $29 billion project to boost LNG exports. “You have global gas prices so high that they incentivize the signing of new long-term contracts,” says Samantha Dart, head of natural gas research at Goldman Sachs. “We are seeing those announcements coming left and right, with a lot of US proposed liquefaction facilities.”

Germany, which has no LNG terminals, has allocated about $3 billion to charter four floating ones and connect them to the country’s network. The first one is supposed to go online around the end of this year. Emphasizing the need for speed, Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck pointed out that Tesla managed to build a factory near Berlin in just two years, and said it’s time to cut through German red tape. “First, dig the trench where the pipe is to go in,” he said. “Then, the permit comes.” China, the world’s top LNG buyer last year, is in the midst of one of the largest buildouts the industry has ever witnessed. Ten new import terminals are slated to come online in 2023 alone, and capacity will roughly double in the five years through 2025, according to BloombergNEF.

Pipelines: Even with more capacity to receive shipments of LNG and turn it back into gas form — a process known as regasification — Europe lacks infrastructure to move it where it might be needed. Spain, for example, has Europe’s biggest regasification facilities — but it only has two pipeline connections to France via the Pyrenees, capable of carrying little more than one-tenth of those volumes, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

Tankers: Shipyards in South Korea, where most of the world’s LNG tankers are built, are seeing a surge in orders that’s leaving them short of skilled labor. They’ve been forced to look outside the country to places like Thailand for welders, electricians and painters, raising their quotas for migrant workers.

In some cases all of this means a U-turn away from policies aimed at combating climate change -– especially in Europe. Government-backed lenders like the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which had been focused on financing renewable energy, have signaled a shift and said they’re now more willing to back gas projects.But Europe’s breakneck efforts won’t be enough, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, which calculates that LNG imports could meet 40% of the region’s gas needs by 2026 — double last year’s figure, but still far short of the volumes that Russia has been supplying.

‘Never More Evident’

That’s why warnings of a gas-driven slump in Europe’s economies are escalating.

Last week, Germany’s government said it’s in talks to bail out utility Uniper SE (ETR: ), which is losing some 30 million euros ($31 million) a day because it has to cover the missing Russian gas at soaring spot-market prices. Companies like chemicals giant BASF SE (OTC: ) say they may have to cut output. Deutsche Bank cited growing risks of an “imminent German recession on the back of energy rationing,” and pointed to soaring power prices in Italy and France too. Morgan Stanley predicted the whole euro area will be in a downturn by year-end.

For some emerging economies — which increasingly have to compete with rich countries like Germany in bidding for LNG cargoes, as gas goes global — the consequences have already been disastrous.

In Pakistan, which built its energy system on cheap LNG, planned blackouts are plunging regions into darkness during the sweltering summer months. Shopping malls and factories in major cities have been ordered to shut early, and government officials are working shorter hours.

Thailand is curbing LNG imports due to surging prices, potentially putting the country at risk of fuel shortages. Myanmar, which is grappling with political instability, stopped all LNG purchases late last year when prices started to rally. India and China have also cut back imports.

“Where once natural gas markets were largely regionally siloed, we now have a globalized spot market that has connected the world’s exposure to the fuel that has become critical to many economies,” said James Whistler, Singapore-based managing director at Vanir Global Markets, an energy and environmental brokerage. “This has never been more evident than in the past few months.”

Investing.com – Oil was down on Thursday morning in Asia as the latest COVID-19 outbreaks and fears of more lockdowns in China drove fuel demand fears.

slid 1.44% to $103.44 by 12:31 AM ET (4:31 AM GMT) and fell 1.36% to $100.63.

The Chinese capital city of Beijing reported 48 new symptomatic and two new asymptomatic COVID-19 cases for April 27, CCTV reported on Thursday. The city began a mass testing program to avoid a lockdown like the one that has been in place in Shanghai for a month.

The city of Hangzhou will also conduct mass COVID testing from Apr. 28, according to state media reported on Wednesday.

Concerns about tightening energy supplies globally added some support to the market. The tightening follows Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and subsequent sanctions on Russia by the U.S. and its allies. Russian energy giant Gazprom (MCX: ) also followed through on its threat to halt gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland on Wednesday.

Shell (AS: ) said in trading documents that it would no longer accept refined oil blended with Russian products. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) also said it had declared force majeure on its Sakhalin-1 operations in Russia’s far east.

Meanwhile, Wednesday’s showed a build of 692,000 barrels for the week to Apr. 22. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a build of 2 million barrels, while an 8.020-million-barrel draw was recorded during the previous week.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open largely unchanged Thursday after the Federal Reserve concluded its latest policy-setting meeting and as the corporate earnings season continues.

At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the contract in Germany traded flat, in France rose 0.1% and the contract in the U.K. was flat.

Investors have been parsing through the Federal Reserve , released late Wednesday, with the U.S. central bank saying that ""progress"" had been made toward its economic goals, potentially bringing forward the time when it might start reining in its bond-buying program. That currently runs at $120 billion a month.

That said, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear, in his subsequent press conference, that the U.S. economy still had to make substantial progress on jobs before any form of tapering, a more dovish tone that the statement suggested.

“Powell hinted that the Fed has already reached one out of two targets and that full employment and inflation ‘moderately exceeding the 2% target’ are not prerequisites for a taper decision. Interesting months are upcoming,” said analysts at Nordea in a note to clients.

European markets have received a positive handover from Asia after reports that Chinese authorities tried to calm market fears about a regulatory clampdown by calling banks overnight. This could allow European investors to concentrate more fully on the ongoing reporting season.

Airbus (PA: ), the world’s largest commercial planemaker, sharply raised its forecasts for full-year deliveries and earnings after reporting better-than-expected half-year results. Royal Dutch Shell (AS: ) also beat estimates, while Volkswagen (DE: ) raised its profit forecasts for the year and Anglo American PLC (LON: ) increased its stock buyback program by another $2 billion.

Credit Suisse (SIX: ) is also likely to be in the spotlight Thursday after the Swiss banking giant revealed that an independent external investigation into the Archegos scandal showed that it had failed “to effectively manage risk” but it had not been involved in any “fraudulent or illegal conduct”. Still, it posted a 78% fall in second-quarter net profit, hit by a sharp drop in its investment banking revenues.

In economic news, and for July are due later in the session, but eyes will also be on the release of the of last week's European Central Bank meeting.

Elsewhere, oil prices rose Thursday, helped by supplies falling to their lowest level since January 2020, resuming their downward trend after last week’s surprise build.

Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, released late Wednesday, showed that dropped by just over 4 million barrels during the week to July 23.

These stocks rose for the first time in nine weeks the previous week, prompting concerns that demand was peaking in the world’s largest consumer.

At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $72.72 a barrel, while the contract rose 0.4% to $74.17.

By Tom Bergin and Ron Bousso

(Reuters) -Bermuda and the Bahamas aren’t exactly big players in the oil-and-gas world. They don’t produce any of the fuels at all. Yet the islands are deep wells of profit for European oil giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc.

In 2018 and 2019, Shell earned more than $2.7 billion - about 7% of its total income in those years - tax-free by reporting profits in companies located in Bermuda and the Bahamas that employed just 39 people and generated the bulk of their revenue from other Shell entities, company filings show.

If the oil-and-gas major had booked the profits through its headquarters in the Netherlands, it could have faced a tax bill of about $700 million based on the Dutch corporate tax rate of 25%. The bill would have been much steeper if the income were reported in oil-producing countries - some of which levy rates exceeding 80%.

Shell and other oil majors are avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes in countries where they drill by shifting profits to thinly staffed insurance and finance affiliates based in tax havens, according to a Reuters review of corporate filings and rating agency reports. Shell, BP (LON: ) Plc, Chevron and Total use subsidiaries in the Bahamas, Switzerland, Bermuda, the UK Channel Islands and Ireland to provide their global operations with banking, insurance and oil-trading services, the documents show. These subsidiaries, in turn, book profits that go lightly taxed or entirely tax-free.

Such arrangements are not illegal. But they highlight the ability of international oil corporations to game global tax systems and avoid handing over revenue to nations where they conduct their core business, according to academics who study corporate taxation.

The profits generated by those offshore units are enormous, despite their tiny operations. BP’s so-called captive insurer - meaning it serves only other BP entities - had $6.5 billion in cash on hand at the end of 2018 after years of robust annual profits, according to insurance rating agency AM Best Co. The insurer, Jupiter Insurance Ltd, has accounted for as much as 14% of BP’s global annual profits in recent years, according to AM Best figures and BP’s financial statements. Jupiter has six directors but no employees; BP outsources insurance administration to a brokerage located in Guernsey, a tax haven in the UK Channel Islands.

Located about 75 miles south of the British coastline, Guernsey is not part of the UK but is a British crown dependency and sets its own tax rates. It charges no tax on corporate profits derived from revenues generated outside the island.

BP spokesman David Nicholas said Jupiter ""is a UK tax resident and therefore is subject to UK tax.""

But BP's insurer paid no UK taxes at all in 2019, according to the oil company's 2019 Tax Report, which was released Wednesday, the same day this story was published. BP offset Jupiter's taxable income with losses from other UK-based affiliates, which the BP report called a typical arrangment. BP said it released the tax report - for the first time - out of a desire to be more transparent about taxation.

The report said the company does not ""engage in artificial tax arrangements.""

The big oil firms’ captive insurers are far more profitable than a typical insurance company. That’s because the amount they pay in claims accounts for a far lower proportion of the money collected in premiums - all from other affiliates of the oil giants - than is the case at other insurers, Industry data shows. That means the captive insurance units absorb part of the revenue made by the oil majors’ subsidiaries elsewhere - often in high-tax countries where they extract oil and gas - and shift it to operations located in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions.

The oil companies have also transferred capital to tax havens to establish banking units that lend money to sister companies. Shell established an oil trader in the Bahamas that generates revenue primarily by buying and selling oil among other Shell affiliates.

The companies named in this story all said they followed tax rules of the nations where they do business. Their subsidiaries in tax havens, the companies said, were located there for commercial or operational reasons rather than to avoid taxation.

Shell denied that its arrangements constituted tax avoidance and said the location of its subsidiaries were driven by business rather than tax reasons.

Profit-shifting among affiliated companies has long been a concern among the Group of 20 nations, which have asked the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which helps coordinate international taxation rule-making, to find ways to rein in corporate tax avoidance. The organization in February issued new guidance on the treatment of intra-group financial transactions, advising nations to limit deductions on such payments.

Critics of corporate tax planning say oil firms’ profit-shifting undermines their claims to responsible corporate governance and exacerbates the deep budgetary problems that many oil-producing countries face amid the coronavirus pandemic and a related drop in oil prices.

“These companies are deliberately exploiting gaps in tax law and weak enforcement, and they are doing so in order to make enormous profits,” said Raymond Baker, president of Global Financial Integrity, a Washington D.C.-based not-for-profit organization that has lobbied for stricter international action against corporate tax avoidance. “The victims are the countries and their budgets and their people.”

Nations such as Angola, Brazil and Trinidad, who rely heavily on oil tax revenues, have had to moderate spending and increase borrowing to respond to the health crisis.

Nigeria is another country that relies heavily on oil tax revenues. Waziri Adio - executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which advocates for stronger governance of oil revenues - said the practices of oil companies may be legal but aren't fair.

“This is something that robs Nigeria of legitimate revenues and will affect the ability of the government to deliver badly needed services to its citizens,” Adio said.

The governments of Nigeria, Angola, Brazil and Trinidad did not respond to requests for comment.

Tax advisors said companies owe it to their shareholders to pay the lowest-possible tax bill.

“Tax planning is a legitimate part of business,” said Bryan Kelly, a partner with law firm Withers in Los Angeles. “The board of directors has a fiduciary duty to maximize profits.”

‘THE NUMBERS DON’T MAKE SENSE’

Shell booked $1.3 billion in 2018 and 2019 profits through Bermuda-based banking and insurance subsidiaries that together employed three people, according to the company’s ‘Tax Contribution Reports’ published in November this year and December 2019 which detail tax payments.

The tiny firms provide insurance and loans to Shell oil-producing facilities worldwide, although Shell said in its most recent tax report, published last month, that it ceased the intra-group lending from Bermuda in 2020 for reasons the company did not disclose. In 2018, the companies derived 96% of their revenues from other Shell companies.

The operations appear to exist primarily for tax purposes, said Richard Murphy, professor of political economy at City University of London. The high profitability of the Bermudan units – along with their heavy reliance on revenue from affiliates – suggests that they are designed to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions, he said.

“The numbers don’t make sense. If Shell is so good at making money in insurance and lending, why doesn’t it sell its services to outside companies and make even more money?” Murphy said.

Shell denied that its Bermuda operations are designed for tax avoidance. “Where Shell entities operate in low-tax jurisdictions, they are there for commercial and substantive reasons,” the company said in a statement.

Over $1.8 billion of Shell’s 2018 and 2019 tax-haven profits were booked by Shell Western Supply and Trading Ltd, a Bahamas-based oil trading operation employing 36 people, Shell said in its tax reports. The company buys oil from Shell fields and other producers in West Africa, Brazil and Guyana and sells two-thirds of the crude to other Shell affiliates.

The in-house oil trader outperforms other big oil merchants. Its annual profits were almost equal to the total $992 million that was earned through the end of September 2019 by independent oil trader Trafigura Group PTE Ltd - which employed 5,106 staff that year, Trafigura’s financial statements show. Shell Western enjoyed a profit margin of 4.1% across 2018 and 2019, according to its tax report. That’s more than four times the level independent oil traders typically report, according to financial statements of the three of the biggest industry players - The Vitol Group, Trafigura and Mercuria Energy Trading BV.

Margaret Cooper, a researcher at Henley Business School near London who studies multinational firms’ tax planning strategies, said that in-house oil trader’s location, its relative high profits and its dependence on trading with affiliated firms suggests that its dealings are designed to avoid taxes.

“I can’t think of any other reason than tax reasons why the company is located where it is,” Cooper said.

Shell declined to comment on whether Shell Western pays any taxes or to answer questions about whether its oil-trading operation is designed for tax avoidance. The company said in a statement that Shell Western’s profits are commensurate with its commercial activities.

BIG INSURANCE PROFITS, LOW TAXES FOR BP

BP’s unusually profitable insurer is housed in the picturesque St Peters Port, the largest town on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel.

A 2019 report from insurance rating agency AM Best noted strong underwriting profits and operating results over the past five years, resulting in a “very strong” balance sheet, with $6.5 billion in cash at the end of 2018.

AM Best reports from previous years include more details on the operation - including immense profits that would be the envy of any insurer.

In 2014, Jupiter had an operating ratio - which includes pay-outs and other costs as a share of premiums - of just 1.3%. That compares to more than 90% for most U.S. insurers, according to data from the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group. Jupiter booked profits totaling $5.8 billion from 2010 to 2013, the last year for which AM Best published profit figures. In 2013, Jupiter’s earnings amounted to 14% of the operating profit reported by BP in financial disclosures.

Jupiter’s profit margins remained exceptional through those years despite the explosion of BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig and subsequent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, one of the worst industrial accidents in history. The incident caused $70 billion in damages, but Jupiter’s payouts to affiliated companies were capped at $1.5 billion for any one event. So, the insurer kept a loss ratio under 15% of premium income for the years 2009 to 2013, according to a 2014 AM Best report.

BP group retained access to Jupiter’s hefty cash pile because the captive insurer lends 98% of its reserves back to Jupiter’s parent, London-based BP International Ltd, for terms of a year or less, according to AM Best. BP pays interest on the money back to Jupiter, adding to the insurer’s low-tax or no-tax profits.

Murphy, the University of London professor, estimates Jupiter could save BP hundreds of millions of dollars annually given its high profitability and the high tax rates that many countries place on oil production.

Jupiter’s registered office is on the first floor of Albert House on the Esplanade, overlooking the harbor in St Peter Port. The offices are not BP’s but belong to a multinational insurance brokerage and advisory company, Willis Towers.

Richard Parris Smith, head of office at Willis Towers Management Guernsey, said his firm manages Jupiter on behalf of BP and has 30 employees that serve all of its clients. Willis Towers lists 35 other captive insurers as clients on a sign outside its office door.

CHEVRON'S BERMUDA INSURER

California-based Chevron Corp (NYSE: ) operates a captive insurer in Bermuda. Until 2015, AM Best issued reports on Heddington Insurance Ltd and rated it highly due to its “good loss history” and “very strong investment income” made through high-interest loans to other Chevron companies. The rating agency did not report specific profit figures or operating ratios for Chevron’s insurer.

Chevron said it formed Heddington to reduce insurance costs and provide broader coverage than what is available in the commercial insurance market. The company said the insurer paid U.S. taxes but declined to detail how much or the effective rate.

Other oil firms have tax-haven subsidiaries through which they self-insure their facilities. France’s Total SA (PA: ) operates Swiss-based Omnium Reinsurance Company S.A., its financial filings show. Total did not respond to requests for comment about Omnium. Switzerland offers captive insurers special tax treatment and rates of less than 10%.

Italy’s Eni SpA operates an Irish-based insurer which covers the company’s facilities in places including Algeria and Nigeria. Like Shell and BP’s insurers, Dublin-based Eni Insurance DAC enjoys lower pay-out costs as a percentage of revenue than insurance industry averages. It reported a profit of 56 million euros in 2018, on which it paid tax at a rate of just 12.5% – half the Italian rate, and a fraction of the amount it would face in oil producing countries.

Eni Insurance DAC says in its financial statements that it aims to reduce insurance costs for the Eni group. Eni said its insurer generates strong profits because it does not have marketing costs to recruit clients like most insurers. The company said in a statement that the insurer’s premiums are in line with market rates and denied the business is designed for tax avoidance.

“The decision to establish the Eni Captive headquarters in Ireland was solely driven by business reasons,” the company said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/special-reporthow-oil-majors-shift-billions-in-profits-to-island-tax-havens-2264071,0.056,0.844,0.101,0.9991

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil companies such as BP (LON: ) and Shell (LON: ) are nurturing nature as a future revenue stream, betting on an expected rise in carbon credit prices as their fossil fuel profits ebb.

BP last year put $5 million into Finite Carbon, a company that connects forestry owners with companies seeking to offset their climate-warming emissions via-tree planting.

The Californian firm expects to generate $1 billion for landowners over the next 10 years, after a 20-40% cut of the proceeds, its chief executive Sean Carney said.

And as companies and countries have rushed over the last year to pledge new net-zero global warming pledges, that forecast may be too conservative, Carney said.

""When you put it next to all the announcements and all the talk, it's a really small number. We might be thinking too low here given the commitments,"" he told Reuters.

Climate change goals, agreed in Paris in 2016, have fuelled a growing, but still immature, market for carbon offsets as companies and countries seek to fall in line.

European oil majors say investing in projects to create more credits is simply good business, offering new revenue streams at a time when oil prices have collapsed and appetite for new exploration evaporates.

""Investing in carbon sequestration, at a time when the world is increasingly carbon constrained, over time will prove to make good commercial, business sense,"" Duncan van Bergen, Shell's head of Nature Based Solutions, told Reuters.

Big oil's involvement has split environmentalists.

Sarah Leugers at the non-profit Gold Standard Registry welcomed interest from large emitters in nature conservation, but added:

""I do worry that they're initiating projects in a market that they can profit from that's attempting to solve a problem that they've largely created,"" Leugers said.

Others note the cash is going toward projects of universal benefit.

""Why would it be OK to make money with digging out fossil fuels, but not with saving the planet?"" said Renat Heuberger, CEO of the leading climate project developer South Pole, which typically takes a 10% cut from credits it develops and sells.

CARBON KLONDIKE

Although some industries are covered by carbon-trading schemes enshrined in law, such as in the European Union, California and Australia, most of the world has no such government-backed markets.

That leaves most emitters with only a handful of small, voluntary carbon offset markets launched over the last 15 years.

And as more seek credits, the price is expected to rise.

Shell's budgets, for example, are based on a carbon price of $85, or around 70 euros, a tonne by 2050 which is more than twice the current price of just under 30 euros on the EU carbon-trading scheme.

While each ""registry"", or voluntary market, has its own rules for entry, they generally work by certifying credits for carbon-reducing projects which preserve forests or wetlands or help swap out wood or coal burning stoves with ones using cleaner fuels.

The entire voluntary carbon offset market last year was worth around $300 million, trading offsets for around 104 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), according to Ecosystem Marketplace, the main aggregator of these data.

However, that compares with the 33 billion tonnes of CO2e emitted by the energy sector alone in 2019, of which 2.1 billion tonnes came from products made by European energy majors, International Energy Agency and Reuters calculations show.

Graphic: How small is the voluntary carbon offset market?: https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/OIL-CARBONCREDITS/oakvexkkmpr/chart.png

A November report by a taskforce of investors and emitters led by former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the voluntary market would have to grow 15-fold to meet the goal of avoiding catastrophic climate change.

Oil majors are playing a growing role in this as they seek to establish themselves in the new carbon neutral world order, with France's Total earmarking $100 million a year for nature-based solutions, including an unspecified amount toward creating credits.

Shell plans to spend $100 million on average over the next year or two on nature-based carbon offsets and van Bergen expects emissions cuts from nature-based solutions or carbon sinks will be ""material"" by 2030 or 2035.

In August it bought Select Carbon which helps farmers in Australia modify their land use and certifies credits for use in a government-managed scheme or sold on the secondary market.

BP's investment in Finite Carbon went toward software that allows landowners to monetise the planting of new trees or preservation of existing woodlands.

Using machine learning, remote sensing and digital payments, the software is aimed at landowners with parcels as small as 40 acres, too small to take part in many carbon markets.

For BP's head of ventures Nacho Gimenez, the Finite Carbon investment fits with a responsibility to rein in emissions.

""As long as someone is investing in something positive, that's the baseline,"" Gimenez told Reuters.

Such nature-based offsets could remove up to 12 billion tonnes of emissions a year on the back of $120-$360 billion spending by emitters, British bank Barclays (LON: ) estimates.

But with no global standard for evaluating the carbon impact of a project or for pricing credits, a credit from the same project can fetch a higher price in one sale than in another.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/big-carbon-oil-majors-turn-to-nature-to-help-plug-revenue-gap-2263156,0.036,0.845,0.119,0.9973

At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the in Germany traded 0.9% lower, the in France fell 0.7% and the U.K.'s index dropped 1.1%.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made it clear at a conference on Thursday that the central bank wouldn’t be changing its ultra-loose monetary policy any time soon.

These comments prompted Treasury yields to rise close to last week’s highs, something that may bush borrowing costs for households and business higher, crimping the recovery.

The February U.S. is due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and will be studied closely, with the addition of 182,000 payrolls expected, compared with just 49,000 in January.

Adding to the concerns Friday were worries about a global fight for Covid-19 vaccines after a shipment of 250,000 doses of AstraZeneca’s drug that were destined for Australia was blocked by Italy under a new European Union regulation. Italy is one of a number of EU countries to have experienced a rise in Covid-19 cases over the last two weeks.

The World Health Organization warned that the number of new coronavirus infections globally rose last week for the first time in seven weeks.

Oil and gas stocks outperformed as crude prices pushed higher, following the decision of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies not to increase output in April. Equinor stock rose 1.8% to its highest in over a year, while Royal Dutch Shell (AS: ) stock and Total (PA: ) stock edged down by less than half a percent each.

The group, known collectively as OPEC+, approved the continuation of current curbs on production at its ministerial meeting on Thursday, with small exemptions for Russia and Kazakhstan.

UBS (SIX: ) stock fell 1.6% after the Swiss banking giant’s net profit dropped marginally last year from the unaudited results, while compensation for its executives soared.

Aggreko (LON: ) stock rose 1.2% after the temporary power provider backed a 2.3 billion pound ($3.2 billion) takeover bid from private equity firms, while London Stock Exchange (LON: ) stock fell 4.5% despite the financial information company reporting a healthy rise in 2020 profit and declaring an increased dividend.

Investing.com -- Stocks rose modestly on Wednesday as big tech earnings surprises rolled in.

Google parent Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: ) helped lift the broader market after better-than-expected profit and revenue as ad spending returned to YouTube and Search businesses.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ), on the other hand, fell slightly after news its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos was stepping away from day to day management later this year.

The biggest influence in the market is a report that President Joe Biden is considering compromises on his proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus, including sending checks to a smaller group of Americans.

The apparent olive branch could potentially sway some Republicans to warm up to the idea of backing the bill, helping Democrats secure the GOP votes that would be needed in the Senate.

The economic recovery continues to strengthen, according to job and other data that will be confirmed by the government’s official job report for January this Friday.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. Earnings from big pharma and big oil

Pharmaceutical giants Merck & Company Inc (NYSE: ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: ) report earnings on Thursday, as does oil giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) PLC Class A (AS: ).

Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect Merck to report earnings per share of $1.38 on revenue of $12.7 billion. Bristol Myers is seen with EPS of $1.41 on sales of $10.7 billion. Shell is expected to have EPS of 14 cents on revenue of $53 billion.

2. Jobless claims

More jobless data is due out Thursday at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), namely in the form of unemployment benefit claims. are expected to be 830,000 and claims are expected to be 4.7 million.

On Wednesday, ADP (NASDAQ: ) said private-sector employment rose by 174,000 last month, surpassing the 70,000 job gains expected.

3. Zoom Video gets a competitor

The software IPO boom continues with Wednesday’s debut of video-marketing company ON24 Inc (NYSE: ). The shares surged 45% on their first trading day after pricing to above $70 after pricing at $50.

ON24 raised $315 million in the offering. The pandemic-winning online communication company Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ) also jumped big-time after its 2019 IPO.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (LON: ) may face calls to pay compensation or a fine when an Australian parliamentary inquiry releases an interim report on Wednesday into how the firm legally destroyed ancient sacred rock shelters for an iron ore mine, industry sources said.

The inquiry into the destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelter in May has heard testimony from dozens of people and more than 140 submissions from miners, heritage specialists and Aboriginal and civil society groups.

The committee is due to table its report to the Senate on Wednesday afternoon, after COVID-19 disruptions delayed hearings, and is now more likely to finish in the second half of 2021 once it has heard testimony from other states, an official told Reuters.

It is widely expected to castigate Rio on its failures as well as propose mining industry and legal reform. Its findings may also include a call for compensation.

""I think the only risk is that Rio has to pay some form of restitution,"" said analyst Glyn Lawcock of UBS in Sydney.

Even then, in the context of Rio Tinto's $123 billion valuation, the amount was not likely to be material; however recommendations to overhaul legislation could result in delays to industry mine expansion plans in the years ahead, he said.

""That could slow the process down and that will have an impact on global supply and demand at the end of the day,"" he said. Western Australia supplies 55% of China's iron ore needs.

Rio is also expected to announce its new chief executive any day, after Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two other senior leaders agreed to step down in August due to the procedural failings it found led to the disaster and the way it was initially managed.

Front runners for the new job include Shell (LON: ) Australia chairman Zoe Yujnovich, who once ran Rio's Canadian iron ore business, former BP (LON: ) Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary, Anglo American (LON: ) finance director Stephen Pearce, OZ Minerals CEO Andrew Cole, and former Fortescue Metals Group CEO Nev Power.

MILAN (Reuters) - Shell (LON: )'s former international upstream head Malcolm Brinded had no reason to think that the awarding of the OPL-245 oilfield license in Nigeria was illegal, his lawyer said on Wednesday.

In a court hearing in Milan, Marco Calleri said his client believed the deal would bring money and benefits to Nigeria and its government and that it was lawful and correct.

""I stand by my view that there is absolutely no basis for the charges against me,"" Brinded said in a comment sent by email.

Brinded is one of four former Shell executives caught up in a long-running bribery case revolving around the purchase of the OPL 245 offshore field in 2011 for about $1.3 billion.

Prosecutors allege that about $1.1 billion of that was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen.

Eni, Shell and a series of other present and former executives, including Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi, are also standing trial in the case.

Investing.com -- Crude oil prices came off eight-month highs in early trading in New York on Friday, but held on to almost all of the gains posted in reaction to a reassuring show of discipline and restraint from the world’s biggest producer nations.

By 11:20 AM ET (1545 GMT), futures were up 1.0% at $46.09 a barrel, while the international benchmark was up 0.8% at $49.10 a barrel. Brent had come within 14 cents of the psychologically important $50 mark in the overnight session, but weakened after the U.S. labor market report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring in the U.S. economy that bodes ill for short-term demand. Nonfarm payrolls grew by only 245,000 in the month through mid-November, the smallest gain in employment since the pandemic erupted earlier this year.

There was slightly better news from U.S. factory orders, which eked out a gain of 1.0% in November, a gentler decline than expected.

Prices appear to be heading into a new, higher range after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia removed the tail risk of a new price war over output policy, with the decision to allow a small increase in production from the end of this year.

The development of multiple vaccines that are expected to allow a return to normal life next year, coupled with the fact that the dip in demand caused by the latest wave has not been as severe as many feared, allowed the OPEC+ bloc to accommodate pressure from countries led by the United Arab Emirates who had argued for raising the production ceiling.

However, the fact remains that the bloc had been expected at the start of this week to freeze output levels for another three months. As such, the market is now rallying on a negative supply shock, something that some analysts are finding hard to swallow. With stocks also rallying on the day of a weak labor market, many are taking this as another sign of the ""Labrador market"" that is simply delighted with everything it sees.

""OPEC raise production? Yay! Bullish on less spare capacity!"" Paul Sankey of Sankey research wrote - ironically - in emailed comments.

But even after the recent surge - up over 30% since the start of November - oil prices still aren't high enough to encourage private investment in production, John Hofmeister, the former head of Royal Dutch Shell (LON: )'s U.S. operations, told Fox Business News earlier this week. Chevron (NYSE: ) became the latest oil major to make further cuts to its capital spending plans on Thursday, a trend that will make it harder for them to sustain production at current levels in future.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/crude-oil-prices-come-off-highs-as-opec-removes-tail-risk-2261930,0.089,0.81,0.101,0.8186

MILAN (Reuters) - The sale of a Nigerian oilfield to Eni and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) was legally ""perfect"" and there was no proof of any corruption, a lawyer for former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete said on Wednesday.

Antonio Secci told a Milan court that prosecutors in the case had been unable to show exactly what role Etete was meant to have had in the alleged corruption of Nigerian public officials - if he had corrupted politicians or had simply been an intermediary between the two majors and the Abuja government.

Eni and Shell acquired the offshore OLP 245 field in 2011 for about $1.3 billion from Malabu, a company owned by the former Nigerian oil minister.

Prosecutors allege that about $1.1 billion of that money was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen, half of it to Etete himself.

Shell says the 2011 agreement was a settlement of long-standing litigation, following the previous allocation of the block by the Nigerian government to Shell and Malabu.

Secci told the court the money had first been paid into an escrow account owned by the Nigerian government before then being transferred to Malabu ""without any corruption (involving Nigerian public officials) emerging.""

He called for his client to be acquitted.

Besides Eni and Shell, another 13 people, including current Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi, are involved in the long-running graft case.

All the defendants have denied any wrongdoing, saying the purchase price was paid into an official Nigerian government account with all subsequent transfers being beyond their control.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Environmentalists seeking to drive down emissions produced by energy giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) told a Dutch court on Thursday the Netherlands was the right place to hear their case.

Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and five other groups are demanding that Shell drastically cut emissions of greenhouse gases in a lawsuit filed in 2019 in the Netherlands, where the company has its headquarters.

Lawyers for the company, which has subsidiaries around the world, said any damage caused by any emissions should be judged in countries where those emissions took place.

""Decisions made in the Netherlands determine Shell's investments and divestments and shape the company's energy portfolio,"" the lawyer representing the environmental groups, Roger Cox, told the district court in The Hague.

""This makes the head office the cause of any environmental damage, now and in the future,"" he said.

The groups filed the case on behalf of more than 17,000 Dutch citizens who say the oil major is threatening human rights by investing billions of dollars in producing fossil fuels.

A lawyer acting for Shell, Jan de Bie Leuveling Tjeenk, told the court in response: ""Emissions are caused by Shell's subsidiaries and by users of Shell's products.""

He added: ""The place where Shell's policies are made is not where the emissions occurred. Damage should be judged by courts in the countries where it was suffered.""

The environmentalists are demanding Shell cuts its greenhouse gas emissions almost in half by 2030 and to zero by 2050, seeking to force the Anglo-Dutch firm to move swiftly away from oil and gas and direct investment to sustainable sources of energy.

Shell has said it aimed to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 30% by 2035, compared with 2016 levels. Environmentalists say that is not enough.

The green groups have cited a 2019 case in which the Dutch High Court ordered the government to step up the fight against climate change, saying a lack of action was putting Dutch citizens in danger.

""If the state is responsible for the emissions of Dutch society as a whole, than Shell's parent company should be held responsible for all the emissions by its subsidiaries,"" Cox said.

(Reuters) - London's rose to a nine-month high on Friday as a jump in oil prices boosted energy stocks, while investors remained focussed on Brexit trade talks with only four weeks left for Britain's transition period out of the bloc to end.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 rose 0.8%, with BP (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) among the biggest gainers as major oil producers agreed to continue production cuts to overcome coronavirus-induced demand concerns.

The FTSE 100 has soared 17% in the past five weeks as news that a working COVID-19 vaccine would be available before year-end sparked hopes of a swift economic recovery, but analysts have cautioned about the near-term damage to the economy from sweeping business restrictions.

""The vaccine is truly a wonderful development, but it's not going to instantaneously change the short-term economic performance,"" said Brian Hilliard, chief UK economist at SocGen.

Data on Thursday showed activity in the UK services sector in November suffered its first fall since June following a four-week partial lockdown across England.

The mid-cap , considered a barometer of Brexit sentiment, rose 0.2%, led by the real estate, technology and consumer staples sectors.

Brexit trade talks are in a difficult phase and a deal can only be struck if the European Union accepts that Britain is a sovereign nation, a British minister said on Friday after London indicated that the chance of a breakthrough was receding.

""This is not a seamless imperceptible transition to a new trading arrangement (and) there will be an impact on UK trade,"" Hilliard said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's top energy companies have slashed the value of their oil and gas assets by around $80 billion (60.05 billion pounds) in recent months after revising lower the long-term outlook for fuel prices in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic and the energy transition.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), the largest U.S. oil company, announced on Monday it would write down the value of properties by $17 billion to $20 billion, its biggest ever impairment following the sharp drop in energy prices this year.

It follows similar steps by rivals including Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), BP (LON: ) and Chevron (NYSE: ) since late 2019.

For graphic of Downsizing: https://graphics.reuters.com/OIL-WRITEDOWNS/qmypmxlrovr/chart.png

The so-called oil majors are ""acknowledging overly optimistic commodity price views of yesteryear,"" said Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint.

Most of Exxon's impairments focused on legacy assets from its $30 billion acquisition of U.S. shale producer XTO Energy in 2010, a deal former CEO Rex Tillerson had previously said was ""ill-timed.""

Following the impairments, companies will focus on the parts of the business that are able to withstand the lowest oil and gas prices, Clint said.

""Balance sheets now reflect the lowest portfolio break-evens in two decades and therefore the most resilient to future commodity price shocks.""

Exxon did not disclose its new commodity price outlook. The value of the oil majors plummeted in 2020 after energy demand collapsed due to the pandemic.

The shares of Exxon, Shell and BP have lost over 45% so far this year, more than benchmark prices that have lost around 27% and stand today near $48 a barrel.

The impairments made by the European majors also came after they lowered their long-term oil prices forecasts as they prepare to increasingly switch to renewable energy in the coming decades to reduce carbon emissions to net zero.

The revisions might nevertheless lead to a sharp rise in oil prices in the coming years as a result of lower investments in new projects, Clint said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian pipe-laying vessel Akademik Cherskiy stopped on Saturday near the construction site of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea, Refinitiv Eikon data showed on Saturday.

The consortium led by Gazprom (MCX: ) building the 1,230 kilometre (km) pipeline said last month that work would resume after it was suspended a year ago when U.S. sanctions targeted companies involved in the construction.

The U.S. ambassador to Berlin called on the German government and the European Union to put a temporary halt to construction work on the pipeline to send a signal to Moscow.

Washington says the pipeline, which has become a flashpoint in relations between Russia and the West that have sunk to post-Cold War lows, compromises European energy security.

""This pipeline is not just an economic project, but the Kremlin's political tool to bypass Ukraine and divide Europe,"" Robin Quinville, acting U.S. ambassador to Berlin, told Germany's Handelsblatt daily.

Eikon data showed the Russian pipe-laying vessel has stopped north of Poland and Germany. Swiss-Dutch company Allseas suspended pipe-laying last December following the threat of sanctions from Washington.

The maritime authority in the German city of Stralsund has informed shippers there will be pipeline-laying activities from Dec. 5 through Dec. 31 in the Baltic Sea area where Nord Stream 2 will make landfall.

It did not say when the work would be finished or how the other remaining sections of the pipeline would be laid, adding that it will name the vessel, which would lay pipes, later. It declined to comment further on Friday.

The $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, led by Russian state energy company Gazprom and aimed at doubling the existing Nord Stream pipeline's capacity, is more than 90% complete.

However, the annual U.S. defence policy bill unveiled by lawmakers late on Thursday contains sanctions that backers say will halt Nord Stream 2.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) will face a Dutch court on Tuesday in the first hearing of a case brought on by environmentalist and human rights groups who demand the energy firm cuts its reliance on fossil fuels.

Seven activist groups, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth Netherlands, filed the lawsuit in April last year on behalf of over 17,000 Dutch citizens who demand that Shell cuts its greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.

The plaintiffs say that Shell is threatening human rights by knowingly undermining international climate goals, as it keeps investing billions in the exploitation of fossil fuels.

""We are confident that the judge’s final verdict will force Shell to adhere to international climate goals and stop causing dangerous climate change"", Friends of the Earth Netherlands director Donald Pols said on the eve of the hearing.

Anglo-Dutch Shell has repeatedly said it supports the goals set out in the 2015 Paris agreement to combat climate change and has promised to cut the carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 30% by 2035, compared with 2016 levels, and by 65% in 2050.

But the action groups demand at least a 45% reduction by 2030, relative to the pollution caused in 2019, as a step towards carbon-neutral production two decades later.

The groups feel strengthened by the so-called 'Urgenda' case, in which the Dutch High Court last year ordered its government to step up the fight against climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions faster than planned.

The district court of The Hague, home of Shell's Dutch headquarters, has planned four days of hearings in the case in December.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-faces-dutch-court-as-climate-change-activists-demand-end-to-emissions-2259474,0.076,0.862,0.062,-0.1901

LONDON (Reuters) - For Big Oil, coffee and chocolate could be the new black gold.

Under pressure from investors and governments alike to cut emissions, major European oil companies are ploughing billions into renewable energy but are struggling to craft business plans that promise the returns shareholders have come to expect.

Europe's big oil firms, however, have another card to play: their vast global networks of filling stations.

BP (LON: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Total all say they are betting on higher profits from sales of groceries and snacks at their retail networks, which will still be an essential port of call for motorists in an electric era.

Paying at the pump to fill up with petrol may only take a few minutes, but even with the fastest electric vehicle (EV) chargers, customers would have at least 10 to 15 minutes to kill - plenty of time to grab a coffee and do some shopping.

While the so-called marketing operations of big oil firms - retail sales of fuel, lubricants, groceries and TV dinners - usually contribute a smaller slice of profits than oil and gas production, they typically have higher margins.

The renewable energy and power businesses oil companies are moving into, however, tend to have lower returns on investment, making it important for firms such as BP and Shell to find ways to boost their overall returns in low-carbon economies.

That's why Shell plans to expand its retail network by more than 20% to 55,000 sites worldwide by 2025. BP aims to increase its network of filling stations by nearly 50% to 29,000 by 2030 and boost its EV charging network to 70,000 points.

Total, meanwhile, is planning to increase its EV charging network in Europe to 150,000 points by 2025 from 18,000 now.

Subway and McDonald's, the world's two biggest food chains, both have fewer outlets than Shell. U.S. giant Walmart (NYSE: ), the world's biggest retailer by sales, has 11,510 stores globally.

BP and Shell are also betting that daily contact with tens of millions of customers will give it masses of data that it can use to tailor sales for shoppers in small towns, cities or even specific petrol stations throughout the world.

LOCKDOWN PREVIEW

While there are relatively few electric cars on the road now, oil companies have already had a glimpse of the potential of their retail networks during coronavirus lockdowns this year.

Fuel sales slumped as travel restrictions kicked in, but people still nipped to nearby petrol stations with convenience stores to stock up on daily necessities.

In fact, Shell's retail division, known as ""marketing"", which has the world's biggest network of filling stations, had its best quarter on record in the three months to Sept. 30, bringing in $1.6 billion in adjusted earnings.

So far in 2020, Shell's marketing division has contributed 60% of its overall earnings, which are traditionally dominated by its upstream oil and integrated gas businesses.

Huibert Vigeveno, Shell's head of refining, chemicals and marketing, said the company holds a daily call to check on customer preferences for anything from engine oil to croissants so it can constantly adapt.

""Having 45,000 retail sites over more than 80 countries allowed us to learn very fast,"" he told Reuters.

""It started in January, when we saw what was happening in China and how consumers were behaving. And we shared that immediately with all the 80 countries in which we operate.""

Shell's marketing profits were also helped by strong sales of premium fuels, which have higher margins, and lubricants.

BP and Total benefited from a boost at their retail divisions during the pandemic months too, helping to plug revenue shortfalls from lower fuel sales and reinforce their plans to expand rapidly into convenience stores and EV charging.

""We saw during the pandemic people shopping online and topping up in local stores like ours, but it's a long-term trend, too,"" said Emma Delaney, BP head of customers and products.

Total's Chief Financial Officer Jean-Pierre Sbraire told investors in October that retail sales in Europe were back at pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter, even though fuel sales remained very weak.

LOW VOLATILITY

BP's profit margins from convenience stores have risen 8% a year since 2015 and they delivered a gross margin of more than $1 billion in 2019, a figure the company aims to more than double by 2030, Delaney told Reuters.

BP's return on investment - or the return on average capital employed - at its convenience and mobility business, which includes sales of fuel and lubricants as well as its stores, was more than 20% in 2019.

Shell too had a return on investment of over 20% at its marketing division, which includes retail, business-to-business fuel sales and lubricants, and Vigeveno said it expects the business to grow 6% to 7% a year until 2025 and beyond.

""The volatility in retail is very low ... but the margin is high,"" said Mirko Rubeis of the Boston Consulting Group. (Graphic: Shell's marketing business delivers steady profits, https://graphics.reuters.com/OIL-RETAIL/yzdpxkzelvx/chart.png)

Return on investment has been in the spotlight since oil majors such as BP announced this year that it plans to cut its fossil fuel production and invest more heavily in low-carbon energy sources such as wind and solar power.

Shell is also looking to accelerate its shift towards low-carbon energy and is due to announce its long-term transition strategy in February.

While big oil firms typically target a return on oil investments of about 15%, returns on low-carbon electricity are expected to be far lower and investors are wondering how they will square the circle.

IS DATA THE NEW OIL?

When it comes to retail, fuel sales already produce lower profit margins than convenience stores sales, which are often in partnership with well-known grocery brands, and that's one of the reasons for the push into areas dominated by supermarkets.

""Redefining convenience is about much more than fuel. Sure, convenient fuel payment via our app works, but customers on the go want much more than fuel. And so we bake pastries, brew coffee, package deliveries for customers,"" Delaney said.

BP works with Marks & Spencer in Britain while Shell has a partnership with British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to offer a range of deli food. In the United States, BP has teamed up with food and drink outlet ampm.

During the months of the pandemic, convenience sales at hundreds of sites were also helped by deliveries to homes using online apps such as Deliveroo and Uber (NYSE: ) Eats, Vigeveno said.

BP estimates that more than half the customers who visit Marks & Spencer at its filling stations come for convenience shopping only. Shell's Vigeveno, meanwhile, said half of their sales in northwest Europe were non-fuel.

Even with a retail push, fierce competition among power companies, supermarket giants such as Tesco (LON: ) in Britain or Carrefour (PA: ) in France and new entrants in the EV charging sector could also narrow profit margins in the future.

And with oil consumption possibly already near its peak, energy companies will need to radically rethink their retail businesses to keep making money.

""To successfully adapt, fuel retailers must embrace a new mindset. Making modest changes or tweaks to the business will not suffice,"" said Boston Consulting Group's Rubeis, adding that the customer data they amass could be crucial.

BP aims to double the daily number of ""customer touchpoints"" in its retail business over the next decade to 20 million while Shell is aiming for 40 million by 2025 from 30 million now.

""Retail is the only thing in the oil and gas value chain that gets you closer to the customer. If you want to have insight into the future trends of mobility, energy transition and so on, that's the only thing that can get you data,"" Rubeis said. ""Customer data is the new oil.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/the-new-black-gold-big-oil-bets-on-retail-networks-in-an-electric-era-2260762,0.029,0.889,0.082,0.9972

While the so-called marketing operations of big oil firms - retail sales of fuel, lubricants, groceries and TV dinners - usually contribute a smaller slice of profits than oil and gas production, they typically have higher margins.

The renewable energy and power businesses oil companies are moving into, however, tend to have lower returns on investment, making it important for firms such as BP and Shell to find ways to boost their overall returns in low-carbon economies.

That's why Shell plans to expand its retail network by more than 20% to 55,000 sites worldwide by 2025. BP aims to increase its network of filling stations by nearly 50% to 29,000 by 2030 and boost its EV charging network to 70,000 points.

Total, meanwhile, is planning to increase its EV charging network in Europe to 150,000 points by 2025 from 18,000 now.

Subway and McDonald's, the world's two biggest food chains, both have fewer outlets than Shell. U.S. giant Walmart (NYSE: ), the world's biggest retailer by sales, has 11,510 stores globally.

BP and Shell are also betting that daily contact with tens of millions of customers will give it masses of data that it can use to tailor sales for shoppers in small towns, cities or even specific petrol stations throughout the world.

LOCKDOWN PREVIEW

While there are relatively few electric cars on the road now, oil companies have already had a glimpse of the potential of their retail networks during coronavirus lockdowns this year.

Fuel sales slumped as travel restrictions kicked in, but people still nipped to nearby petrol stations with convenience stores to stock up on daily necessities.

In fact, Shell's retail division, known as ""marketing"", which has the world's biggest network of filling stations, had its best quarter on record in the three months to Sept. 30, bringing in $1.6 billion in adjusted earnings.

So far in 2020, Shell's marketing division has contributed 60% of its overall earnings, which are traditionally dominated by its upstream oil and integrated gas businesses.

Huibert Vigeveno, Shell's head of refining, chemicals and marketing, said the company holds a daily call to check on customer preferences for anything from engine oil to croissants so it can constantly adapt.

""Having 45,000 retail sites over more than 80 countries allowed us to learn very fast,"" he told Reuters.

""It started in January, when we saw what was happening in China and how consumers were behaving. And we shared that immediately with all the 80 countries in which we operate.""

Shell's marketing profits were also helped by strong sales of premium fuels, which have higher margins, and lubricants.

BP and Total benefited from a boost at their retail divisions during the pandemic months too, helping to plug revenue shortfalls from lower fuel sales and reinforce their plans to expand rapidly into convenience stores and EV charging.

""We saw during the pandemic people shopping online and topping up in local stores like ours, but it's a long-term trend, too,"" said Emma Delaney, BP head of customers and products.

Total's Chief Financial Officer Jean-Pierre Sbraire told investors in October that retail sales in Europe were back at pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter, even though fuel sales remained very weak.

LOW VOLATILITY

BP's profit margins from convenience stores have risen 8% a year since 2015 and they delivered a gross margin of more than $1 billion in 2019, a figure the company aims to more than double by 2030, Delaney told Reuters.

BP's return on investment - or the return on average capital employed - at its convenience and mobility business, which includes sales of fuel and lubricants as well as its stores, was more than 20% in 2019.

Shell too had a return on investment of over 20% at its marketing division, which includes retail, business-to-business fuel sales and lubricants, and Vigeveno said it expects the business to grow 6% to 7% a year until 2025 and beyond.

""The volatility in retail is very low ... but the margin is high,"" said Mirko Rubeis of the Boston Consulting Group. (Graphic: Shell's marketing business delivers steady profits, https://graphics.reuters.com/OIL-RETAIL/yzdpxkzelvx/chart.png)

Return on investment has been in the spotlight since oil majors such as BP announced this year that it plans to cut its fossil fuel production and invest more heavily in low-carbon energy sources such as wind and solar power.

Shell is also looking to accelerate its shift towards low-carbon energy and is due to announce its long-term transition strategy in February.

While big oil firms typically target a return on oil investments of about 15%, returns on low-carbon electricity are expected to be far lower and investors are wondering how they will square the circle.

IS DATA THE NEW OIL?

When it comes to retail, fuel sales already produce lower profit margins than convenience stores sales, which are often in partnership with well-known grocery brands, and that's one of the reasons for the push into areas dominated by supermarkets.

""Redefining convenience is about much more than fuel. Sure, convenient fuel payment via our app works, but customers on the go want much more than fuel. And so we bake pastries, brew coffee, package deliveries for customers,"" Delaney said.

BP works with Marks & Spencer in Britain while Shell has a partnership with British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to offer a range of deli food. In the United States, BP has teamed up with food and drink outlet ampm.

During the months of the pandemic, convenience sales at hundreds of sites were also helped by deliveries to homes using online apps such as Deliveroo and Uber (NYSE: ) Eats, Vigeveno said.

BP estimates that more than half the customers who visit Marks & Spencer at its filling stations come for convenience shopping only. Shell's Vigeveno, meanwhile, said half of their sales in northwest Europe were non-fuel.

Even with a retail push, fierce competition among power companies, supermarket giants such as Tesco (LON: ) in Britain or Carrefour (PA: ) in France and new entrants in the EV charging sector could also narrow profit margins in the future.

And with oil consumption possibly already near its peak, energy companies will need to radically rethink their retail businesses to keep making money.

""To successfully adapt, fuel retailers must embrace a new mindset. Making modest changes or tweaks to the business will not suffice,"" said Boston Consulting Group's Rubeis, adding that the customer data they amass could be crucial.

BP aims to double the daily number of ""customer touchpoints"" in its retail business over the next decade to 20 million while Shell is aiming for 40 million by 2025 from 30 million now.

""Retail is the only thing in the oil and gas value chain that gets you closer to the customer. If you want to have insight into the future trends of mobility, energy transition and so on, that's the only thing that can get you data,"" Rubeis said. ""Customer data is the new oil.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/the-new-black-gold-big-oil-bets-on-retail-networks-in-an-electric-era-2260762#comments,0.029,0.889,0.082,0.9972

Investing.com -- prices soared to their highest since March on Tuesday, as optimism over the economic outlook for 2021 strengthened.

By 11:30 AM ET (1630 GMT), U.S. futures were up 46% at $45.04 a barrel, while the international benchmark was up 3.8% at $47.77 barrel.

U.S. futures were likewise sharply higher, rising 4.8% to $1.2623 a gallon, their highest since early September.

On a day of little industry-specific news, oil and other industrial commodities ripped higher as investors bought ever more aggressively into the notion that the distribution of vaccines to fight Covid-19 will lead to a vigorous snapback in growth next year. Three companies have so far declared that their experimental drugs have success rates of 90% or more in preventing the disease. None, however, has official regulatory approval from any jurisdiction yet.

The enthusiasm was reinforced by the sight of the political fog lifting over Washington, with President Donald Trump all-but conceding the election to Joe Biden in the wake of Michigan's certification of its results on Monday. Biden has reportedly named former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as his pick for Treasury Secretary, which has encouraged hope in a broadly expansionary fiscal policy next year. Those hopes overlook the fact that the Senate is still likely to remain in Republican hands, complicating any efforts to get major fiscal expansion passed.

Signs from the industry itself still appear mixed: Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Total both announced the closure of big refineries on Tuesday, one in Louisiana, the other in France, in a reflection of the collapse in refining margins in recent months.

The market was also encouraged by what it chose to take as hints of further cooperation between Russia and Saudi Arabia in keeping excess supply off world markets for the coming months. President Vladimir Putin held a telephone call with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman earlier Tuesday. The Kremlin's summary of the conversation nodded to what it called their ""effective"" coordination of oil supplies this year, strengthening expectations that the planned increase in production by the so-called OPEC+ bloc will be pushed back for perhaps as much as three months to the start of April Newswires reported Saudi and Russian officials downplaying suggestions of coordination ahead of next week's ministerial meeting, at which any such decisions will be taken.

NEW YORK/MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - China, the global oil market's lifeline this year, has stepped up purchases from exporters like Russia, the United States and Angola in recent weeks, while buyers elsewhere pare orders as coronavirus infections surge and fresh lockdowns are put in place.

China, the world's largest importer of crude, is the only major buyer expected to see increased oil demand this year as the pandemic destroyed consumption globally.

With China's imports expected to reach 12 million barrels per day (bpd) next year, sellers are lining up shipments to retain market share as worldwide oil consumption is expected to fall by nearly 9% in 2020.

(For graphic on Global oil demand by region during Q2 and Q3 2020: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/azgpojbjrvd/GlobalOilDemandQ2Q3.png)

This week, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ), Russian Lukoil's (MM: ) trading arm Litasco and Unipec, the trading arm of China's state-owned Sinopec (SS: ), have provisionally booked, or are looking to book supertankers to ship from the Gulf Coast to Asia in December, according to shipbrokers and Refinitiv Eikon data.

COVID-19 infections are rising worldwide, particularly in heavy fuel users like the United States and Europe.

For the last few months, that pushed the prices of key crude grades lower, allowing Chinese buyers to take advantage. The country is also ramping up commercial oil stockpiling, buying oil at low prices to increase reserves.

The International Energy Agency said last week that China was on track to be the only major country to boost its demand for oil year-on-year. It estimates global demand at 91.3 million bpd in 2020, down from 100.1 million bpd in 2019.

""Lockdowns will probably be in place in Europe for much of this winter. China has raised its quotas and (storage) capacity. It looks like the demand will be centered there in the near future,"" a trader at a European refiner said.

The premium for Russian January-loading ESPO Blend crude, one of the most popular grades for Chinese independent oil refiners, is at five-month highs.

U.S. crude grades are rebounding as well, with WTI in East Houston climbing to its highest in about two months this week. U.S. grades have been pressured due to a 12% drop in domestic fuel demand and as new COVID-19 infections hit daily records.

These come on the back of firmer Middle East crude prices, which makes up the baseload of Asia's demand. This week, Qatar sold January-loading al-Shaheen crude at the highest premiums in four months.

""Chinese demand is more visible now,"" one trader in the Russian Far East crude oil market told Reuters. ""Trading firms are very active as they expect more requests from China's independent oil refiners that will buy oil under new import quotas.""

A Chinese buyer said traders were offering U.S. crude, North Sea Forties and West African grades as they expected arbitrage economics to improve after sharp gains in Middle East prices.

(For graphic on China crude oil imports by region: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gjnpwbljrvw/ChinaOilImportsbyRegion.png)

Premiums for ESPO Blend firmed to $2.90 per barrel above Dubai quotes this week, their highest since June, as trading of January volumes began. Russia's Sokol crude cargoes loading in January also recently firmed to four-month highs.

Oil grades that have higher naphtha yields such as light, sweet U.S. crudes, are in higher demand from petrochemical buyers, one trader with an Asian refiner said. Light grades produce more gas oil, used for heating, which is also in greater demand, versus jet fuel, where consumption has collapsed.

One senior Chinese trader said heavier crude grades, such as in West Africa, were seeing less robust demand. In Angola, Africa's second biggest crude exporter, heavier grade Dalia is trading at a lower premium than medium grades Cabinda and Girassol, which were at multi-month highs.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/global-crude-market-finds-support-mainly-from-china-demand-2253476,0.115,0.817,0.068,-0.9864

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Can you put a price on pollution? Some of the world's biggest economies are doing just that as they wrestle with how to make good on grand pledges to tame planet-warming emissions.

Matters are coming to a head.

China, Japan and South Korea have all followed the European Union in pledging to cut emissions to ""net zero"" in recent weeks, where they release only as much as they remove from the air. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden made the same promise in his election campaign.

Next year they are set to lay out the first practical measures to meet these targets, as part of commitments under the Paris climate accord, and putting a price on carbon will be front and centre, experts told Reuters.

""Each country will have to come up with its own path to reaching net zero, but the expectation is carbon pricing is going to be a very important part,"" said Wendy Hughes, Carbon Markets and Innovation Manager at the World Bank.

The principle is simple: a carbon price establishes how much companies need to pay for their emissions. The higher the price, the greater the incentive to pollute less and invest in low-carbon technology.

Governments can force these payments through a carbon tax - a levy companies must pay when they pollute - or through an emissions-trading system (ETS).

An ETS sets a maximum cap on the amount of emissions that a sector, or group of sectors, can produce. It creates ""carbon permits"" for those emissions, which companies can buy for each tonne of CO2 they emit.

Many countries, from Europe and South Korea, to China and Kazakhstan have already launched schemes, of various scope.

More than fifth of global emissions are covered by 46 national carbon-pricing schemes operating today or in the planning stage, as well as 32 regional systems within countries, according to the World Bank.

The biggest of those - the EU carbon market - is preparing for a major overhaul.

Since the European system was launched in 2005, emissions from participating power plants and factories have dropped by 35% – a sharper drop than seen in sectors not covered by the scheme.

""The ETS has proven its efficiency,"" said Frans Timmermans, head of EU climate policy. ""The ETS shows how carbon pricing is a strong driver for immediate change in energy consumption.""

Graphic: Verified emissions under the EU ETS excluding aviation: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/yzdvxkkkopx/Pasted%20image%201605865949677.png

PRICE BALANCING ACT

In the power sector, the scheme helped make coal plants uneconomic, compared with less-polluting gas plants or renewables.

But the trick for these markets is to get the carbon price right. If it's too low, there's little incentive for companies to rein in emissions; too high, and risk knee-capping industry.

The EU, seeking steeper emissions reductions to meet its new 2030 climate targets, will propose to expand and reform its ETS from next year.

The changes would involve including more sectors, such as shipping, and curbing the free permits given to EU industry to help it compete with overseas companies that don't pay carbon costs.

The carbon price – currently at around 27 euros price per tonne of CO2 - needs to hit levels that push industry toward investing in emissions-cutting technologies like hydrogen, analysts say.

""The carbon price has to reach high enough to enable the European Union to reach net zero by 2050,"" said Mark Lewis, Chief Sustainability Strategist at BNP Paribas (PA: ).

""On this basis, I think around 90 euros a tonne is a reasonable expectation by 2030,"" he said.

GUARDING AGAINST SHOCKS

Other major economies are catching on. China, now the world's top greenhouse gas emitter, plans to launch its own national ETS, possibly as early as next year. That system would become the world's largest, and is expected to cover several billion tonnes of CO2 from power plants each year.

Experts say China's preparations for launching its ETS have sped up since President Xi Jinping's announcement in September that China would become carbon neutral by 2060.

""There is a sense of urgency that hasn't been seen for quite a long time,"" said Beijing-based lawyer Shawn He, who assists companies with carbon compliance.

The EU has worked with the country on developing carbon-pricing policies for more than a decade, both on the pilot regional markets China is now running and on a national scheme.

Jos Delbeke, a former senior EU climate policymaker who led the development of the bloc's trading scheme, said his advice to China had been to build a system that could gradually be reformed over time and could withstand economic shocks.

The EU learned that lesson after the 2008 financial crisis, when factors including a lack of flexible rules meant the market could not respond to a recession-induced drop in emissions, and became plagued by an oversupply of cheap permits.

The price of carbon permits didn't recover until 2018, when the EU said it would introduce a ""market-stability reserve"" from 2019 which removed excess permits from the system.

China's pilot schemes have already looked at using a similar reserve system, according to Huw Slater, senior carbon consultant with consultancy firm ICF in Beijing.

""It is a little early at the national stage to know whether they will do a similar thing, but it is quite possible.""

CARBON ACROSS BORDERS

Establishing a single, global price on carbon remains a distant prospect, however.

""The idea of a global carbon price was built on the assumption there would be dozens of linked trading systems. That hasn't happened,"" said David Hone, chief climate adviser at oil major Shell (LON: ), which uses an internal carbon price to help meet its own sustainability goals.

Internal carbon prices also help to protect investments from any future carbon-pricing policies.

Talks at the U.N. have failed for two years to agree a common set of rules for international carbon markets.

The lack of global coordination has led the EU to start drafting a carbon border-tax policy - a levy on imports into Europe of polluting goods like steel and cement. The aim is to protect European industry from cheaper imports from regions with lax climate policies.

In the United States, Biden has pledged to do the same, with a $2 trillion plan to cut emissions.

Making access to some of the world's biggest markets conditional on paying a CO2 price should prod countries with weak climate policies ""to begin figuring out how they are going to move in a low-carbon direction to remain competitive"", said the World Bank's Hughes.

""It is possible to create linkages across domestic trading systems,"" she added. ""In the longer term, a global carbon price is desirable ... the fact we don't see one immediately doesn't mean it's not moving in the right direction.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/analysis-carbon-pricing-rises-as-worlds-weapon-of-choice-in-climate-fight-2255931,0.047,0.875,0.078,0.9834

By Matthew Green and Simon Jessop

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are pushing major European companies to make sure the ""missing"" costs of climate change are properly reflected in their financial statements, a move that could wipe billions of dollars off the value of sectors from energy to aviation.

The European and U.S. investors, who manage $9 trillion in assets, have sent 36 carbon-heavy companies a document https://www.iigcc.org/download/investor-expectations-for-paris-aligned-accounts/?wpdmdl=4001&masterkey=5fabc4d15595d setting out how they should account for the likely impact of the 2015 Paris climate accord on their future profits.

The investors suspect that existing balance sheets rest on assumptions over variables such as oil prices, carbon taxes, and the lifespan of fossil fuel assets that are incompatible with a shift to net-zero carbon emissions under the Paris deal.

JPM Morgan Asset Management (part of JP Morgan Chase & Co (N: )), DWS (DE: ), Fidelity International and M&G Investments (L: ) were among 38 asset managers to back the document, according to a copy of an accompanying letter https://www.iigcc.org/download/iigcc-letter-to-european-companies-on-paris-aligned-accounts/?wpdmdl=4006&masterkey=5fabc9c5af24f shared with Reuters by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, an industry coalition.

In a statement published on Monday, the investors called on the companies to ""address missing climate change costs in financial accounts"".

""Either we get serious and start shifting capital flows towards activities aligned with the Paris Agreement, or we continue to talk about it,"" said Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at London-based asset manager Sarasin & Partners, who wrote the 23-page investor expectations document.

""Paris-aligned accounts are amongst the most important changes that will drive system-wide capital redeployment,"" Landell-Mills said.

Among the companies the investors wrote to were Germany's E.ON (DE: ) and Uniper (DE: ), Spain's Iberdrola (MC: ) and Endesa (MC: ), France's Air Liquide (PA: ), Austria's OMV (VI: ) and London-listed Anglo American (L: ).

When contacted for comment, the companies variously referred Reuters to existing commitments on sustainability and climate risk disclosure, emphasised they welcomed investor engagement, and said they needed time to study the requirements.

ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS

The campaign builds on a previous initiative led by Landell-Mills and an initial core of investors to challenge European oil majors and their auditors over their accounting assumptions in light of the Paris deal.

Landell-Mills said that engagement was vindicated in June when British major BP (L: ) said it would write off up to $17.5 billion from the value of its assets after revising down its long-term oil and gas price forecasts. Anglo-Dutch rival Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and France's Total (PA: ) booked smaller impairments.

Regulators have increasingly been encouraging companies to make voluntary disclosures of how they expect climate change to affect their businesses, and some countries, including Britain and New Zealand, are making these mandatory.

But the investors say that accountants and auditors may be failing in their existing legal duties to factor in foreseeable risks linked to both the prospect of rapid decarbonisation and physical impacts from climate change, meaning companies may be overstating their capital.

""Too many company accounts are leaving out material climate-related impacts, and this is not just putting shareholder capital at risk; it could have catastrophic consequences for our planet,"" according to the investors' document.

The document said investors could exert leverage on the issue by engaging directly with audit committees and company boards, by voting out directors and auditors, and by divesting shares.

Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship at the governance advisory arm of Federated Hermes, among the asset managers backing the campaign, said investors would review 2020 accounts for ""clear evidence"" of a response from both board directors and auditors.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/investors-tell-european-firms-to-reveal-missing-climate-costs-in-their-accounts-2251365,0.028,0.894,0.079,0.9681

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's Nyhamna gas export terminal has restarted production and is ramping up output following a shutdown triggered by a strike among workers, system operator Gassco said on Sunday.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Hourly employees at Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc’s Convent, Louisiana, refinery, scheduled for permanent closure as early as next week, received details this week of the severance package negotiated by their union and Shell, three people familiar with the agreement said on Friday.

Shell said on Nov. 5 it was closing the refinery after failing to find a buyer for the plant, which has been hit hard by crushed demand in the COVID-19 pandemic. A spokesman did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the agreement.

Shell put the Convent refinery up for sale in July, and was quick to pull the trigger on the closure, the sources said. Shell’s Anacortes, Washington, refinery and Saraland, Alabama, chemical plant, are still operating even though both have been for sale of a longer period of time, the sources said.

The Anacortes refinery has been on the market since at least January.

The United Steelworkers union (USW) and Shell agreed that employees will be paid three weeks for every year of service with a minimum of 12 weeks and a maximum of 78 weeks, the sources said. That offers an extra week of pay per year of service than other refiners which closed plants this year provided, two of the sources said.

About 350 workers are represented by the Steelworkers and can receive the package, they said.

The package for unionized workers is similar to what Shell salaried employees are being offered, they said. The number of salaried and hourly staff is about equal, the sources said. Another 400 contractors work at the Convent refinery.

The dismissed hourly workers can apply for jobs at Shell’s Norco, Louisiana, refinery and Geismar, Louisiana, chemical plant. Some workers will remain to clean up the refinery and some could work at the site into the third quarter of next year, the sources said.

Shell plans to continue seeking a buyer for the refinery.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-convent-louisiana-refinery-workers-get-severance-package-details--sources-2258355,0.029,0.927,0.043,0.7096

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) PLC may begin the permanent shutdown of its 211,146 barrel-per-day Convent, Louisiana, refinery early next week, people familiar with plant operations said on Monday.

Shell announced on Nov. 5 the refinery, located 57 miles (92 km) west of New Orleans, was to close after the company failed to find a buyer amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

A Shell spokesman did not reply to a request for comment.

The Convent refinery is first U.S. Gulf Coast refinery to permanently close because of the pandemic-related decline in demand for refined products. Eight other North American plants have been idled or targeted for shutdowns.

The coronavirus pandemic cut fuel demand by up to 30% earlier this year, and even as economies recover the outbreak will likely reduce global demand by 4.7 million barrels per day (bpd) over the next five years, analysts have said.

Three U.S. oil refineries have shut already this year because of weak demand for jet fuel, diesel and gasoline amid a slowing economy.

In August, Calcasieu Refining idled its 135,500-bpd Lake Charles, Louisiana, facility, citing weak margins from falling demand. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE: ) has said it will not restart production at its refineries in Martinez, California, and Gallup, New Mexico.

Shell this month said it will halve its crude processing capacity at its 500,000 bpd Pulau Bukom plant in Singapore over the next three years. Plants in the U.S. and Europe are considering converting some facilities to produce biofuels.

U.S. refineries in August ran at 78.8% of their 18.6 million barrels per day (bpd) capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, down from 83.1% in March.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-may-permanently-shut-louisiana-refinery-next-week--sources-2258313,0.072,0.922,0.006,-0.9509

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON: )'s female employees in Britain earned 18% less on average than their male colleagues in 2020, with the pay gap slightly narrowing from the previous year.

In its annual UK diversity pay gap report, Shell also published for the first time data on ethnicity which revealed that the average pay and bonuses for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) employees was 8.5% lower than non-BAME staff.

Women represented 34% of the energy company's 6,000-strong British workforce in 2020, mostly due to the prevalence of men on offshore oil and gas facilities. BAME employees made up 21% of the workforce.

The gender pay gap stood at 18.7% in 2019, 18.6% in 2018 and 22.2% in 2017. Shell said it had achieved its ambition to have women in 30% of senior positions in the country.

Gender gap pay is defined as the difference in the average pay and bonuses of all men and women across an organisation.

(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is poised to add chipmaker SMIC and offshore oil-and-gas explorer CNOOC (NYSE: ) to a list of firms blocked from American investment due to military ties, Reuters reported, in the latest U.S. swipe at Beijing before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.

Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Corp. are among four Chinese companies to be added to a list of firms owned or controlled by the military, Reuters reported, citing a document seen and three unidentified people familiar with the matter. Their addition -- along with China Construction Technology Co. Ltd. and China International Engineering Consulting Corp. -- would bring the total number of firms on the blacklist to 35.

It wasn’t clear when the new list would be published in the Federal Register, Reuters said. The Defense Department didn’t respond to Reuters’ request for comment.

CNOOC didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment. Cnooc Ltd., the company’s listed unit, fell as much as 9.3% in Hong Kong. China Oilfield Services Ltd., its drilling subsidiary, fell as much as 11%.

“There will be huge impact on the company because the oil-and-gas value chain involves a lot of U.S. companies from upstream, mid-stream all the way to the gas side,” said Sengyick Tee, an analyst with SIA Energy. “This also means they cannot procure parts and software from U.S. companies.”

President Donald Trump, a Republican, has continued to roll out punitive measures against China despite losing the U.S. presidential election earlier this month to Biden, a Democrat. The actions will make it harder for the incoming administration to de-escalate tensions with Beijing, although they will also arguably give the U.S. side more leverage in future negotiations.

In a related executive order earlier this month, the U.S. said China was “increasingly exploiting” American capital for “the development and modernization of its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses,” posing a threat to the U.S. That order prohibits investment firms and pension funds from buying and selling shares of 31 Chinese companies designated by the Pentagon since June as having military ties.

In response to the previous order, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. of “viciously slandering” its military-civilian integration policies and vowed to protect the country’s companies. “This not only severely harms the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, but also the interests of foreign investors including U.S. ones,” ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at the time, urging the order’s withdrawal.

Exxon, Shell (LON: )

State-owned CNOOC, the country’s main deepwater oil and gas explorer, has ties to key global energy producers and projects. The firm is among Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ).’s partners in its Guyana project, owns a stake in a Royal Dutch Shell Plc LNG export terminal in Australia, and has a share in the U.K. North Sea’s Buzzard oil field.

CNOOC’s main base of operations are the coastal waters surrounding China, which account for more than 60% of its listed company’s production, with the majority coming from the Bohai Sea near Beijing.

Operations in the South China Sea, which account for about 29% of output, have at times run into controversy because China claims drilling rights in waters far from its borders, and within 200 miles of countries like Vietnam and the Philippines. The firm also owns interests in shale and deepwater projects in the U.S., accounting for production of about 67,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, according to its website.

SMIC was little changed after falling as much as 0.9% earlier. A company representative referred request for comment to a prior statement denying military connections.

SMIC Restrictions

In September, the U.S. Commerce Department separately imposed export restrictions on SMIC, requiring American firms to apply for a license to send certain products to China’s largest chipmaker. SMIC and its subsidiaries present “an unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end use,” the department’s Bureau of Industry and Security wrote.

SMIC represents a cornerstone in China’s vision of creating its own, world-class semiconductor industry, which the Communist Party sees as an essential foundation for a self-sufficient technology sector. The company is the country’s biggest contract manufacturer of chipsets and raised more than $7 billion to expand in a Shanghai stock offering in July.

SMIC still has far to go to catch up to rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).’s most advanced smartphones. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, is commercializing 5 nanometer technology, at least two generations ahead of SMIC’s capabilities.

A Trump administration blacklisting would make that effort more difficult -- if not impossible -- because SMIC could be barred from American suppliers, which tend to make the most advanced chip-making equipment.

Investing.com -- Crude oil prices extended their gains on Tuesday as the market continued to reassess the outlook for fuel demand in the wake of an announcement on Monday that encouraged hopes for an early end to the Covid-19 pandemic.

By 9:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), U.S. futures were up 1.5% at $40.88 a barrel, while futures, the international benchmark, were up 1.5% at $43.03 a barrel.

Both, however, were off intraday highs after Brent, notably, failed again to break a familiar resistance level at around $43.55, according to analysts at Saxo Bank.

Prices had soared on Monday after Pfizer (NYSE: ) announced its experimental Covid-19 drug had proved over 90% effective in preventing the coronavirus, citing results from a late-stage trial. Gains moderated as the market absorbed the fact that the vaccine’s safety and longevity still need to be proven.

Newswires quoted Russell Hardy, CEO of leading oil trader Vitol, as telling a conference Tuesday that he now sees oil prices heading back to $50 a barrel, as a recovery in demand leads to a faster drawdown in global inventories. Even so, he said there may be some “difficult months” before then.

Saxo analysts acknowledged that the Pfizer news was a major boost for oil, but noted that “with Covid-19 cases still surging, not least in the U.S. the short-term outlook remains challenging.”

The U.S. recorded its fourth straight day of over 100,000 new infections and surges from California to the Midwest and the Mexican border strongly suggest that the pandemic has veered out of control while the nation has been distracted by the election campaign.

The level at which inventories are being whittled down from their abnormally high levels remains the key variable in the market, with the OPEC+ bloc deliberately producing less than current demand to put pressure on stockpiles. The American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly estimate of U.S. stockpiles at 4:30 PM ET, as usual.

Elsewhere, Bloomberg reported that Chinese inventories had fallen substantially in recent weeks as the domestic economy recovers. That has led to the government increasing private refineries’ import quotas for next year, which will be a net support to global demand. Beijing has also put in place minimum prices for refined products to guarantee refinery margins, at a time when refining margins around the world are under acute pressure. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) said on Monday it would shut its Louisiana refinery after having failed to find a buyer.

Elsewhere later, the U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its regular Short-Term Energy Outlook, the first of three major surveys on the oil market this week.

(Reuters) - Democrat Joe Biden has won the November U.S. presidential election, according to several major networks. Here are some of the changes that could occur in U.S. energy policy under his administration:

INTERNATIONAL OIL SUPPLIES

Biden has shown an interest in multilateral diplomacy similar to previous Democratic administrations. That could mean an eventual path for OPEC members Iran and Venezuela to get out from under Washington’s sanctions and start pumping again, if the right conditions are met.

In Iran, that path could include a partnered approach between Washington and Europe, similar to a deal struck under Obama's administration.

In Venezuela, Biden appears likely to continue to favor sanctions to pressure the regime of President Nicolas Maduro, but could increase diplomatic efforts to end the impasse by negotiating a new election or power-sharing with the opposition.

Outgoing President Donald Trump's unilateral sanctions on the two countries have taken around 3 million barrels per day of off international markets, a little more than 3% of world supply.

Biden's campaign has not detailed how it would approach these issues.

LINE TO OPEC

Biden lacks the chummy rapport that Trump had developed with Saudi Arabia’s defacto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. That country is the biggest voice in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, meaning Biden may not engage as closely on the group’s production policy. He is also more likely to rely on quiet diplomatic channels for influencing OPEC than Trump's Twitter-centered approach.

Biden's campaign has not yet detailed how it would approach these issues, but any influence he would wield as president would likely be in service of the same goal - a moderate oil price. Any U.S. president needs affordable fuel for consumers. And for Biden, the price would need to be high enough to make clean energy alternatives to fossil fuels competitive in support of his ambitious climate plan.

Trump had been more engaged with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries than most of his predecessors. He has sometimes influenced OPEC policy with his tweets and phone calls, arguing for an oil price low enough for consumers but high enough for drillers.

His sanctions also weakened the influence of OPEC hawks Venezuela and Iran within the group, removing two big historical hurdles to a pro-Washington OPEC policy. That concentrated power with leading producer Saudi Arabia, along with Russia, part of the group known as OPEC+.

A GREEN TRANSITION?

A Biden administration would look to re-enter the Paris Climate Agreement, an international pact negotiated during the Obama administration to fight global warming that Trump pulled away from saying it could hurt the U.S. economy.

Biden has also vowed to bring U.S. emissions down to net zero by 2050, including by bringing emissions from the power industry to net zero by 2035 - a goal that will be tricky to accomplish without a Democratic majority in Congress.

Biden's view is that climate change is an existential threat to the planet, and that a transition from fossil fuels can be an economic opportunity if the United States moves fast enough to become a leader in the clean energy technology.

Trump's administration had acted to weaken or eliminate emissions targets, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's softening of vehicle emissions standards, and its rescinding of former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan requiring cuts from the electric power industry. Transport and electricity together make up around half the country’s greenhouse gas emissions.

While European oil and gas companies like BP (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) have already begun implementing strategies for a global energy transition, U.S. majors like Exxon Mobil (N: ) and Chevron (N: ) have remained focused on the traditional energy business - sheltered politically by Trump's leadership in Washington.

FEDERAL DRILLING

While Trump had sought to maximize domestic oil and gas production, Biden has promised to ban issuance of new drilling permits on federal lands and waters in order to fight global climate change.

The United States produced nearly 3 million barrels of crude oil per day from federal lands and waters in 2019, along with 13.2 billion cubic feet per day of , according to Interior Department data.

That amounts to about a quarter of total domestic oil output and more than an eighth of total U.S. production of gas. A federal ban on new permits would mean those numbers trend toward zero over a matter of years.

There would also be an impact on public revenue federal oil and gas production produced about $12 billion in public revenue in 2019, divided between the U.S. Treasury, states and counties, tribes, and cleanup funds.

New Mexico, for example, received $2.4 billion in disbursements last year, much of it going to its historically underfunded education system. The state’s Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham told Reuters this spring she would seek a waiver from Biden’s government to allow continued drilling if he was elected.

Biden’s camp has been mum on whether such a waiver program would exist.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/factbox-how-a-biden-presidency-would-transform-the-us-energy-landscape-2247233,0.057,0.849,0.095,0.9838

LONDON (Reuters) - A lawsuit launched by the Nigerian government against U.S. bank JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: ), claiming over $1.7 billion (1.29 billion pounds) for its role in a disputed 2011 oilfield deal, will proceed to trial, London's high court ruled on Thursday.

The suit filed in the English courts in 2017 relates to the purchase of the offshore OPL 245 oilfield in Nigeria by oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Eni (MI: ) in 2011, which is the subject of an ongoing trial in Milan.

The six-week London trial will start on the first available date after Nov. 1 next year, meaning that proceedings may not begin until 2022.

JP Morgan declined to comment.

Central to the case is a $1.3 billion payment from Shell and Eni to secure the block that was deposited into a Nigerian government escrow account managed by JP Morgan.

As part of the proceedings, JP Morgan will also have to disclose within 21 days which individuals at the bank made the final decision to transfer the funds in question.

""Nigeria is pleased that JP Morgan has agreed it will now confirm all the senior figures at the bank who were involved,"" a spokesman for the Nigerian government on this case said.

""This claim will move forward and Nigeria will hold JP Morgan accountable for its central role in the OPL 245 fraud.""

In the claim, Nigeria alleges JP Morgan was negligent in its decision to transfer the funds in escrow to a company controlled by the country's former oil minister Dan Etete instead of government coffers.

The damages sought include the monies allegedly sent to Etete, around $875 million paid out in three instalments, plus interest taking the total to $1.7 billion.

The decision is also likely to compel the bank to disclose details of its internal processes. JP Morgan sought to quash the case last year.

The Milan trial began in 2018. In July 2020, Italian prosecutors asked a Milan court for Eni and Shell to be fined and some of their present and former executives, including Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi, to be jailed.

They further requested Eni and Shell to be fined 900,000 euros ($1.06 million) each and sought to confiscate a total of $1.092 billion from all the defendants in the case, the equivalent of the bribes alleged to have been paid.

Final defence arguments from lawyers representing Shell, Eni and its executives are being made to the court. The next hearing is scheduled for Nov. 25.

(Bloomberg) -- Oil-rich Abu Dhabi will open a commodities exchange in March to rival those of Middle Eastern neighbors and allow investors to trade its crude using futures contracts for the first time.

The ICE Futures Abu Dhabi exchange will open on March 29 and offer contracts based on the emirate’s flagship Murban crude grade, pending regulatory approvals, Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ) Inc. said in a statement Monday. The Atlanta-based operator of trading and clearing platforms is setting up the exchange with government producer Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. and other oil suppliers.

Abu Dhabi is the capital of and holds most of the oil in the United Arab Emirates, the third-largest producer in OPEC. Murban crude, pumped from onshore fields, makes up more than half the sheikhdom’s crude output, now at around 2.6 million barrels daily.

By selling through futures, Abu Dhabi will let the market determine the price of its . It’s a significant change for a producer that until this year fixed its pricing retroactively, effectively telling buyers the cost of barrels purchased a month earlier.

Adnoc wants Murban futures to serve as a regional benchmark for Gulf barrels heading east. Benchmarks help buyers in Asia, the biggest and fastest-growing oil market, to compare crude from the U.S., Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

Oman and the UAE emirate of Dubai joined with CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ: ) in 2007 to start the Dubai Mercantile Exchange, which trades Omani crude futures. Oman, Dubai and Saudi Arabia price off those contracts. Most other producers in the Persian Gulf -- which pumps about a fifth of the world’s oil -- base their monthly pricing on Dubai and Oman crude-price assessments by S&P Global Platts.

Murban is lighter and contains less sulfur than most Middle Eastern crudes, making it easier to refine. It generally fetches higher prices and is similar in quality to , futures for which are traded on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange.

Vitol Group, BP (NYSE: ) Plc, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Total SE were among the nine oil traders and producers that joined as partners in the planned exchange last year. Adnoc pushed back the start from the first half of last year, initially due to the need for regulatory approvals and then as the coronavirus pandemic upended markets.

crude has doubled since April, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners agreed to cut output to meet plunging demand. But the global benchmark is still down about 39% this year.

(Reuters) - Shell (L: ) said on Thursday it will begin shutting down its 211,146-barrel-per- day refinery in Convent, Louisiana in November, the largest refinery to close as the coronavirus pandemic weighs on demand for fuels.

The company failed to secure a buyer for the refinery, which it announced it was marketing in July, the Shell said.

“After looking at all aspects of our business, including financial performance, we made the difficult decision to shut down the site,” Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said in a statement.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) will halve crude processing capacity and cut jobs at its Pulau Bukom oil refinery in Singapore as part of an overhaul to reduce the company's carbon dioxide (CO2)emissions to net zero by 2050, it said on Tuesday.

The refinery on Pulau Bukom, a small island in the Southeast Asian city-state, can process 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil and is Shell's largest wholly-owned refinery worldwide.

Shell has launched a broad review of its business aimed at cutting costs as it prepares to restructure its operations by reducing its oil and gas business and expanding its renewable energy and power division.

In September, Shell said it planned to cut up to 9,000 jobs globally, or more than 10% of its workforce.

As part of the plans, Shell is cutting the number of oil refining and petrochemical sites it will keep operating to six from 14. Besides Pulau Bukom, the other sites are in Texas, Louisiana, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada.

""Bukom will pivot from a crude-oil, fuels-based product slate towards new low-carbon value chains. We will reduce our crude processing capacity by about half and aim to deliver a significant reduction in CO2 emissions,"" Shell said.

The company will cut 500 jobs by the end of 2023 at the site, which now employs 1,300 staff, a Shell spokeswoman said.

""We will progressively make changes in our refinery configuration over the next three years,"" she said.

The company announced in August that it would convert its refinery in the Philippines into an import terminal as it was no longer economically viable.

In Singapore, Shell said it was studying the production of products that would still be viable following its energy transition, such as biofuels and specialities like bitumen.

It is also looking at using different raw materials, or feedstocks, such as recycled chemicals. Shell operates a plant at Bukom that produces 800,000 tonnes of ethylene a year.

In Singapore, Shell said it would expand its solar power generation, including utility-scale plants, build electric vehicle charging points, provide carbon-neutral solutions for its customers and study plastic waste recycling.

Shell is also expecting its first bunkering ship for liquefied (LNG) to arrive in Singapore later this year. It will be operated by FueLNG, a joint venture with Keppel Offshore & Marine.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/shell-to-cut-jobs-capacity-at-singapore-oil-refinery-its-largest-globally-2248406,0.05,0.909,0.041,-0.7184

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish wind energy group Iberdrola (MC: ) plans to invest 75 billion euros (67.7 billion pounds) in its renewable energy production, grids and retail operations by 2025 to capitalise on growing global demand for clean power, it said on Thursday.

Countries and companies the world over are seeking to cut emissions to combat climate change, buoying renewables-focused companies including Iberdrola.

Pursuing the opportunities created by the ""energy revolution"" facing the world's major economies should help to boost net profit by more than 40% from 2019 to 5 billion euros in 2025, Iberdrola said.

Shares rose throughout morning trade and were up 3.1% on the day at 1300 GMT, outperforming a positive Spanish stock index ( ) and taking Iberdrola's gains so far this year to around a quarter. It has become Spain's second biggest company after Zara owner Inditex (MC: ).

For years, renewable companies have struggled to generate big profits, while fossil fuels have provided easier margins, but as COVID-19 lockdowns have hobbled energy use and hammered oil and gas markets, the investment focus has been transformed.

Oil and gas companies, including Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), BP (L: ) and Total (PA: ), are moving towards renewable power, but Iberdrola's new spending plan eclipses their combined planned investments in low carbon.

Other utilities are joining Iberdrola in building green capacity and wind energy is set to reach record growth globally over the next five years.

Denmark's Orsted (CO: ) is in the midst of a $30 billion investment plan and Italy-based Enel (MI: ), the region's leader, has set aside 14.4 billion euros to build renewables capacity and phase out coal between 2020 and 2022.

Iberdrola promises steady earnings for its shareholders.

They will receive between 0.40 and 0.44 euros per share by 2025 as the company sets aside a total of 94 billion euros for both the investment plan and its dividend plan, Iberdrola Chief Financial Officer Jose Sainz said.

The money will mainly come from operations and cash management, but 19% will be from taking on debt, Sainz said.

Half the overall investment will be split between the United States, where it announced last month its local unit Avangrid (N: ) would buy utility PNM Resources (N: ), and Britain, where it owns Scottish Power.

At home in Spain, spending, mainly on renewables and networks, will more than double to 14.35 billion euros over the life of the plan.

Iberdrola hopes one costly Spanish project, building capacity to produce hydrogen from renewable sources, will get European Union funds as the bloc seeks to emerge from a coronavirus-induced recession by focusing spending on sustainability.

By 2030 Iberdrola aims to increase solar and onshore wind capacity by 2.5 times and offshore wind power by 4.5 times, to reach a total generation portfolio of 95 gigawatts (GW).",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/iberdrola-to-invest-67-billion-in-energy-revolution-by-2025-2246057,0.031,0.874,0.095,0.9806

(Reuters) - London stocks rose on Thursday after the government and Bank of England both ramped up stimulus programmes to cushion the struggling economy as England goes into a second national lockdown.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index ( ) closed 0.4% up, with shares in insurer RSA Insurance Group Plc (L: ) surging 45.7% after it reported a rise in underwriting profit and said pandemic-related exclusions would limit lockdown impacts.

The domestically focused mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) ended 0.7% higher after finance minister Rishi Sunak extended the government's costly coronavirus furlough scheme until the end of March and announced billions of pounds in other forms of support.

Earlier on Thursday, the BoE expanded its already huge asset purchase programme by a further 150 billion pounds helping the government to fund the surge in public spending.

""Today's announcements are vital steps to shelter the UK economy through a difficult winter. The extension of the furlough scheme will help provide a much needed bridge for households and businesses until the economy can reopen,"" said Ambrose Crofton, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

""However, the risk remains that for many businesses, faced with the uncertainty of how long this crisis may last, they may decide to make lasting decisions to either cut jobs or cease trading.""

Focus was also on the U.S. presidential election race, with Democrat Joe Biden edging closer to victory, while incumbent President Donald Trump pursued a litigation strategy as election officials tallied votes in the handful of states that will decide the outcome.

LONDON (Reuters) - Most company accounts are not meeting the needs of investors in factoring in the related risks of climate change, Britain's audit watchdog has told the boards of British firms.

The Financial Reporting Council said in the letter published on Thursday that it expects them to do a better job of assessing areas such as the impact on asset impairments and fair value.

Some financial statements did not mention climate change even though narrative reporting elsewhere in a company's annual report suggested it could be having ""a significant impact on key financial statement assumptions"", the FRC said.

The move follows a campaign by some investors to push companies including oil majors BP (LON: ) and Shell (LON: ) to better reflect climate risk in their accounts.

Ahead of the next reports from companies the FRC said that where relevant financial statements should show how climate risk impacted key assumptions and disclosures.

As well as how climate impacts the impairment of individual assets and cash generating units, their fair value and likely useful economic life, other key data could include the potential scale and timeline for provisions.

Among other issues, the FRC said it also wanted companies to describe the impact of their businesses on the environment, including their supply chains - a key focus for investors as they look to manage climate risk in their portfolios.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/uk-watchdog-says-accounts-dont-meet-investor-needs-on-climate-risk-2250055,0.039,0.862,0.099,0.93

(Bloomberg) -- Oil extended its biggest monthly decline since March after a surge in coronavirus infections in the U.S. and Europe dented prospects for a rebound in demand.

Futures in New York declined 0.4%, after hitting their lowest since June on Thursday. The Covid-19 surge in the U.S. Midwest rose to a record, and the seven-day average in the Northeast reached the most since May. Elsewhere, Italy reached another daily record in virus cases, potentially facing new restrictions on movement.

Crude found some support from data showing a record, yet temporary, surge in U.S. economic growth in the third quarter, while European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde signaled a new package of monetary stimulus in December.

The demand outlook is still bleak with the European Union’s two biggest economies set to impose month-long movement restrictions as nations across the continent post record coronavirus cases. A boost to consumption in the form of U.S. stimulus will likely have to wait until after Nov. 3, with both sides at a standstill a week out from the election. The forward market structure is also flashing warning signs, with the strip for 2021 closing at its weakest level since May.

For fragile oil markets, the outcome of next week’s U.S. election poses yet another risk: the prospect that major producer Iran may regain its role in international trade.

Meanwhile, U.S. Gulf operators are still dealing with the effects of Tropical Storm Zeta, with Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc shutting crude and production overnight in the Mars Corridor due to downstream impacts from the storm.

The industry continues to suffer in the face of the pandemic, with Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). announcing plans to slash its global workforce by 15% by the end of 2022, an unprecedented culling by North America’s biggest oil explorer as it struggles to preserve dividends.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil and gas companies worldwide are taking an axe to their employment rolls, shedding workers to survive what is expected to be a prolonged stretch of weak demand.

Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ) said it will cut its workforce by 15%, or about 14,000 people, along with oil majors Chevron Corp (N: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ).

All told, more than 400,000 oil and gas sector jobs have been cut this year, according to Rystad Energy, with about half of those in the United States, where several big exploration companies and most large oil service companies are headquartered.

Coronavirus has devastated swathes of the global economy, with energy, travel and hospitality among the industries hit hardest. Energy companies were already struggling with weak returns, particularly those operating in U.S. shale regions, but have had to double down on cost cuts as investors pressure companies to improve margins.

""The COVID-era reality across the oil industry is austerity on an epic scale. There is no escaping the fact that this means, among other things, job losses,"" said Pavel Molchanov, analyst at Raymond James.

In addition to Exxon, Chevron Corp, Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd (AX: ) and Canada's Cenovus Energy Inc (TO: ) all announced plans in recent weeks to cut staff.

Global fuel demand slumped by more than a third in the spring. While consumption has recovered somewhat, it remains lower than a year ago with major economies resuming lockdowns to contain the pandemic.

The downturn has been particularly harsh in the United States, the world's largest crude oil producer. The nation has recorded the most deaths from coronavirus, and the damage from the pandemic has sent unemployment to about 8%.

U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said it is unlikely to return to the peak, near 13 million barrels per day, reached in 2019, largely through the use of fracking technology used by shale companies. The shale industry has been hit hard by the pandemic because it is easy for oil firms to cut staff and spending in the sector.

Fracking has become a hot-button issue in the U.S. presidential campaign. Democratic challenger Joe Biden wants to limit fracking on federal lands, while incumbent President Donald Trump has pushed for more drilling, and argues Biden's position would destroy jobs.

Consolidation is helping drive job cuts. Chevron plans to eliminate roughly 25% of the staff acquired with Noble Energy, which it acquired this month. Shell said its oil output likely peaked last year, and it plans to cut roughly 10% of its workforce. Cenovus said it will cut 25% after it buys rival Husky Energy Inc (TO: ).

In Australia, more than 2,000 oil industry jobs have been cut since March, including at Exxon and Chevron. Top independent gas producer Woodside said earlier this month that it would cut around 8% of its workforce.

Mohammad Barkindo, secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, recently expressed concern that the pace of oil demand is below expectations, potentially requiring major producers to maintain production cuts.

Not all companies are throttling back. PetroChina Co Ltd (SS: ), Asia's largest oil and gas producer, reported a 350% surge in profit from a year earlier.

In an outlook released earlier this month, BP Plc laid out two scenarios that suggest world oil consumption, roughly 100 million barrels per day, peaked last year. BP Plc (L: ) recently cut about 50% of its exploration team as it shifts operations towards renewable energy development.

Currently, futures markets suggest crude prices ( ) ( ) may not advance beyond $40 a barrel for at least two more years due to weak demand, and that could limit hiring.

""The practical reality is when you have oil prices in the $30 to $40 range, I don't think many companies have the luxury to wait for a recovery,"" said Alex Pourbaix, chief executive at Cenovus.",https://uk.investing.com//news/coronavirus/coronavirus-consolidation-taking-toll-on-energy-jobs-2242582,0.11,0.826,0.064,-0.9892

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Power plants fuelled by will not be classed as a sustainable investment in Europe, unless they meet an emissions limit that none currently comply with, according to draft European Union regulations seen by Reuters.

The landmark EU rules, due to be finalised this year, will force providers of financial products to disclose from the end of 2021 which investments meet climate criteria, and can therefore be marketed as ""sustainable"".

The aim is to steer billions of euros in much-needed private funding into low-carbon projects to help the EU hit ambitious climate goals, and limit so-called greenwashing by stopping the labelling of investments that do not meet the criteria as ""green"".

The draft rules say that to be classed as a sustainable investment - one that makes a ""substantial"" contribution to curbing climate change - gas power plants must not produce more than 100 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour.

Even Europe's most efficient gas plants produce more than three times this limit, according to estimates by industry and independent climate think tank Ember.

To comply, plants could use carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology - currently, no European gas plants do so, although companies such as Equinor (OL: ) and Shell (L: ) are developing local CCS projects in industrial sectors.

""The gas lobby has had its core request conclusively rejected,"" said Rebecca Vaughan, an analyst tracking industry lobbying for InfluenceMap.

Gas industry groups ramped up lobbying efforts after most gas plants and pipelines were excluded from a provisional list published in March. Companies including BP (L: ), Total (PA: ) and Equinor signed an open letter to EU leaders this month calling for the green finance rules to build on the existing gas market and network as the backbone of the bloc's future energy system.

The Commission declined to comment on the draft rules, which are subject to change before publication.

The rules would not ban companies from investing in projects that don't meet the EU's ""sustainable"" criteria but industry groups have warned that excluding gas plants could mean they will struggle to raise finance - even for investments to reduce emissions.

The EU rules use a tighter emissions limit than the 250g of CO2 per kwh threshold used by the European Investment Bank to screen investments. The EIB will stop financing unabated fossil fuel projects by end-2021.

""Having a threshold that is not in line with the EIB suggests a lack of joined up rules between public and private lending, which is perverse,"" Eurogas Secretary General James Watson told Reuters.

The draft rules would label certain pipeline investments as sustainable - including refurbishments to enable gas pipelines to carry more low-carbon gases like hydrogen, or repairs to plug methane leaks.

However, investments in new pipelines would only count as sustainable if they are dedicated to transporting low-carbon gas.

Rules on nuclear power investments will be added following a Commission analysis.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/eu-set-to-deny-gas-power-plants-a-green-investment-label--draft-2242312,0.037,0.922,0.041,0.5429

(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). posted a loss for a third straight quarter, a day after the the oil giant announced it will cut 15% of its workforce in an attempt to shield its dividend.

Exxon is confronting one of its biggest crises since Saudi Arabia began nationalizing its oilfields in the 1970s. The company lost $680 million, or 15 cents a share, during the third quarter, compared with the 25-cent per-share loss forecast in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The company’s crude-refining business was hit particularly hard by weak fuel demand and prices.

Blindsided by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods abruptly ditched an ambitious rebuilding effort and imposed widespread job cuts that are unprecedented in Exxon’s modern history.

The firings and layoffs, announced less than 24 hours after Exxon declared a $3.7 billion payout to shareholders, will affect 1,900 U.S. workers and thousands more around the world. Pandemic-induced lockdowns have crushed demand for oil, and chemicals, sending Exxon’s finances into a tailspin. Prior to 2020, the company hadn’t posted a quarterly loss in at least three decades.

Although third-quarter results outperformed expectations, the company is still struggling to generate enough cash to fund dividend payments and capital projects.

Exxon’s cash flow has all but evaporated, Woods’s aggressive rebuilding plan has ground to a halt, and criticism is growing over the company’s climate strategy. The most immediate question for investors is how long the $15 billion-a-year in dividends survive.

Exxon follows rivals Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ), BP (NYSE: ) Plc and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc is disclosing just how trying the third quarter proved. Chevron disclosed a surprise profit after slashing capital spending almost in half. Meanwhile, BP (LON: ) narrowly avoided a loss but warned that any recovery will be a long, slow slog.

Shell, for its part, exceeded all analysts’ forecasts by posting almost $1 billion in adjusted profit. The Anglo-Dutch giant also dangled the promise of fattening the dividend that’s dwindled to less than half of its year-ago value. Total SE also surpassed estimates.

Exxon has plunged about 50% this year, lagging U.S. rival Chevron Corp. but ahead of Shell and BP. The drop has sent Exxon’s dividend yield soaring to more than 10%, a level that indicates investors expect the payout to be cut.

To defend the dividend and appease investors, Woods is implementing an extensive internal cost-cutting drive. Exxon cut $10 billion in capital spending in April and delayed some marquee projects. That slowdown is translating into job cuts, Woods said in a recent email to staff, adding to layoffs in Europe and Australia.

As if its financial performance wasn’t enough to worry about, Exxon is under pressure from critics to reset its climate strategy. Its European rivals have all committed to some form of carbon neutrality by mid-century but earlier this month Woods underscored his faith in fossil fuels. Oil and gas will still make up about half the global energy mix in 2040 and provide the most cost-effective pathway to development in poor countries, Woods told employees in the email.

Exxon is scheduled to host a conference call with analysts and investors at 9:30 a.m. New York time. Andrew Swiger and Jack Williams (NYSE: ), both senior vice presidents and members of Woods’s inner circle, will speak during the call.

LONDON (Reuters) - Developers across the world are for the first time testing the use of hydrogen to power ships as the maritime industry races to find technologies to cut emissions and confidence grows the fuel is safe to use commercially.

To reach goals for the shipping industry set by the United Nations, industry leaders say the first net-zero ships must enter the global fleet by 2030. Ships powered by green hydrogen could help meet the target.

Made from electrolysis to split water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity from renewable energy, green hydrogen is emissions free.

Oil major Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) last month reiterated its commitment to hydrogen, which it saw as ""advantaged over other potential zero-emissions fuels for shipping"".

While hydrogen's green credentials make it attractive to industrial users, including ship owners and oil majors, it is far less dense than other fuels, meaning more onboard fuel storage capacity is needed. That makes it more feasible, for now, for use in vessels on short voyages.

Swiss-headquartered technology group ABB is working on hydrogen fuel cell systems, including for passenger and cargo ships. One of its projects involves developing a fuel cell-based power and propulsion system for a new-build river vessel along France's Rhone river.

""ABB sees short-distance shipping as the first adopters of the fuel cell technology,"" said Juha Koskela, division president, ABB Marine & Ports.

FUEL SYSTEM PILOTS

Green hydrogen fuel costs around 4-8 times the price of very low sulphur fuel oil, estimates by risk management firm DNV GL find.

Other types of hydrogen are cheaper, but that is because they are produced using fossil fuel, which means they are not emissions free.

Green hydrogen is expected to fall in price over the next couple of decades as the cost of renewable energy and electrolysers falls.

For companies to invest en masse, however, the associated infrastructure for refuelling and transportation, including electrolysers, compressors, storage, tanks and pipelines, must also be in place.

Christos Chryssakis, of DNV GL, said it took around 20 years to establish liquefied refuelling infrastructure. He said the process could be quicker for hydrogen, but industry estimates find many billions in investment would be needed.

In Norway, regulations could accelerate the process.

Cruise ships and ferries sailing through the country's heritage-protected fjords must be emissions-free by 2026, which is prompting shipping companies to consider fuel combinations including hydrogen.

Norwegian-headquartered ship designer and ship yard Ulstein is working on building a support ship for the offshore oil sector that would use hydrogen as one power option.

""Rather than wait for hydrogen bunker infrastructure to be matured, we went for a hybrid design using a containerised solution for the hydrogen storage tanks,"" Ulstein's Nick Wessels said.

The company is also working on a separate hydrogen project for wind installation turbine vessels, he said.

Municipalities in Norway have launched a tender process, which includes the development of hydrogen-powered, high-speed vessels by 2022, officials say.

Other countries are also making strides.

Belgium's Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB) built its first hydrogen-powered passenger shuttle boat, which hit the waters in 2017 in Belgium. It will provide a hydrogen ferry for Japan by April next year - the first hydrogen ferry in Asia - and is involved in a tug boat project with the port of Antwerp, CMB's chief executive Alexander Saverys said.

Other ports are working on hydrogen options at terminals.

The Spanish port of Valencia said it will deploy prototype machinery, including for box container handling operations, early in 2021, while Britain's Felixstowe port is looking into hydrogen, based on its proximity to offshore windfarms and a nuclear power plant.

SHORT TRIPS VERSUS OCEAN TRADE

The shipping industry, which is responsible for 2.89% of global CO2 emissions, is in the midst of a transition to fuels that would reduce those emissions by 50% by 2050 from 2008 levels.

A study by the non-profit Global Maritime Forum (GMF), which mapped out 66 projects looking at zero emissions in shipping, showed 19 of the 21 initiatives relating to fuel production used hydrogen in some form.

The majority of these anticipated using hydrogen to make other products, such as ammonia, methanol or ethanol, to improve the schemes' viability. Seven are pure hydrogen projects.

Some in the shipping industry remain unconvinced hydrogen is safe as a power source for larger vessels carrying large amounts of fuel onboard.

But for many, the bigger question is economics.

""The big challenge using hydrogen for deep sea shipping is the cargo volume you would lose to have enough hydrogen stored for long voyages, which could be a commercial killer,"" Kasper Søgaard, GMF head of research, said.

Ulstein's Wessels expects the need for backup fuel options will persist until there leap in technology and infrastructure.

""I don’t think you can build a completely hydrogen-powered vessel of large size at this point in time. There will still need to be another accessible power source like diesel,"" he said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/first-wave-of-ships-explore-green-hydrogen-as-route-to-net-zero-2242700,0.013,0.924,0.062,0.9891

(Reuters) - London stocks fell on Thursday as concerns that a resurgence in coronavirus cases might derail a fragile economic recovery, offsetting a clutch of positive earnings from Royal Dutch Shell and Lloyds Bank.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index ( ) ended flat in choppy trading, with oil major Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) gaining 3.6% after it posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and increased its dividend.

Lloyds Banking Group Plc (L: ) added 2.3% after the domestic lender posted a forecast-beating quarterly profit, boosted by a home-loan boom.

After rising as much as 0.6% in the morning trade, the domestically focussed FTSE 250 ( ) ended 0.4% lower, dragged down by aero ( ) and retailer ( ) stocks.

""Because we're now heading into Q4 which looks much more uncertain in terms of back to lockdowns and restrictions, people can be much more wary about buying into equities when we're going into a second wave, the duration and scope of which we don't know anything about at the moment,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.

The UK market has come under pressure this week on concerns that an accelerating second wave of infections could prompt more drastic lockdown restrictions. Both the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 are set for their biggest weekly declines since early June.

Housing minister Robert Jenrick said a second national lockdown in Britain was not inevitable and the government will do everything to avoid one, even as a study by Imperial College showed England's COVID-19 infections doubled every nine days.

In company news, BT Group Plc (L: ) reversed course to close 2.5% lower after Britain's biggest fixed-line and mobile operator said profits probably wouldn't get back to pre-pandemic levels until 2022-23.

Standard Chartered Plc (L: ) tumbled 7.7% after the lender warned it would take longer to hit a key profitability target due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/ftse-100-edges-higher-on-strong-lloyds-bank-shell-earnings-2241785,0.046,0.898,0.056,0.7787

LONDON (Reuters) - Spanish wind energy group Iberdrola (MC: )'s plans to spend around $88 billion (67.5 billion pounds) on renewable power by 2025 eclipse Europe's top oil companies' combined planned investments in low-carbon over the same period.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), BP (LON: ), Total, Norway's Equinor, Spain's Repsol (MC: ) and Italy's Eni aim to grow their low-carbon businesses after setting out plans to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades.

The group's combined spending on renewables such as offshore wind and solar power as well as retail businesses in some cases is set to grow nearly 10-fold over the next five years from $7.35 billion in 2020 to $69.2 billion by 2025, according to company announcements and Reuters estimates.

Iberdrola said on Thursday it plans to invest 75 billion euros (67.7 billion pounds) in its renewable energy production, grids and retail business by 2025 to capitalise on growing global demand for clean power.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) estimates that Europe's Big Oil companies could spend close to half of their capital expenditure on low carbon activities compared with 10% to 15% in 2019.

Their installed power capacity is expected to grow 20 fold from 7 gigawatt (GW) currently to over 140 GW by 2030, the bank said in a note in September.

Investing.com -- A rotten week for European stocks is ending with a semblance of stabilization, as some positive-looking updates from cyclical companies in particular restore a little hope to markets battered by the second wave of the pandemic.

By 6:25 AM ET (1025 GMT), the benchmark was down a relatively modest 0.2%, after falling some 5.7% over the four previous sessions as Germany and France, the region’s two biggest economies, both tightened restrictions on economic and social life.

The measures have cemented widespread expectations that Europe will have to repeat its full lockdown measures from the spring in order to flatten the infection curve, even though the measures announced this week leave schools, factories and, in the case of Germany, almost all retail open.

Markets got a moderate degree of support from better-than-expected results from cyclicals such as Total, which rose 3.1% after the French oil and gas major again kept its dividend unchanged from pre-pandemic levels. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Equinor had raised their payouts on Thursday, confident that their restructuring measures had strengthened their balance sheets enough to justify the move.

In addition, French aero engine maker Safran (PA: ) stock rose 2.8% after confirming its guidance for the year. German rival MTU Aero Engines (DE: ) also said its margin before interest and taxes will be at the top end of its forecast 9%-10% range. MTU stock still slid 0.3%, however.

Germany’s continued to underperform with a 0.4% decline, due in part to weakness in growth and momentum stocks. That was an echo of the reaction to Big Tech’s earnings on Thursday, in which investors reacted negatively to the lack of optimistic guidance, even though earnings from Apple (NASDAQ: ), Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and especially Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) beat expectations.

For most of the year, investors have been content to buy into a halfway-convincing growth story at any price, driving such stocks to valuation multiples last seen during the tech bubble in 1999.

Delivery Hero and stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (DE: ), two of the four best-performing stocks in the DAX this year, led the losers with declines of over 2%. Delivery Hero, which has never turned a profit, currently trades at 10 times its expected revenue this year.

Better-than-expected growth figures for the third quarter, while welcome, did little to change an overall gloomy mood. Eurostat reported Eurozone gross domestic product rebounded 12.7% in the third quarter, considerably more than the 9.4% expected. As with the U.S. figures released on Thursday, the rebound still leaves GDP considerably below pre-pandemic levels and down 4.7% from a year earlier.

GDP figures are always backward-looking, but this particular quarter’s had been rendered obsolete by the European Central Bank on Thursday, whose President Christine Lagarde said all the data point to “a significant softening in economic activity in the final quarter of the year.”

Lagarde succeeded on Thursday in anchoring bond yields with a promise of fresh monetary stimulus in December. That has helped support bank stocks, which continue to report quarterly results broadly ahead of expectations. Spain’s BBVA (MC: ) was the latest to do so, pushing its stock up 2.8%.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Thursday, bouncing off Wednesday’s sharp losses, helped by some positive corporate news and ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting.

At 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the in France rose 0.1%, while the U.K.'s index climbed 0.1%.

The announcement of additional measures to try and combat the new surge in Covid-19 cases, with France closing all non-essential businesses and Germany shutting its hospitality industry for a month, hit European stock markets hard Wednesday, with the DAX, for example, closing 4.2% lower.

But positive corporate updates have helped to steady the ship on Thursday.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) stock rose 3.3% after the oil major reported a larger-than-expected profit for the third quarter and raised its dividend, just six months after slashing it for the first time since the Second World War.

Lloyds (LON: ) stock rose 2% after the U.K. bank blew expectations away with its third quarter profit, after receiving its biggest quarterly increase in mortgage applications since 2008.

Volkswagen (DE: ) stock rose 1.9% after the German car manufacturer returned to profit in the third quarter, helped by surging Chinese demand for luxury cars, while Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR: ) gained 2.7% as the world’s largest brewer reported impressive earnings on the back of strong demand in the U.S. and Brazil.

It wasn’t all good news though, as Nokia (NYSE: ) stock fell over 12% after the Finnish telecom network equipment maker reported disappointing third-quarter underlying profits in its first earnings report under new Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark.

Later in the session, investors will look to the European Central Bank for guidance after its governing council meeting.

“The ECB is moving closer towards more action, but it is too early to do so this month. While we look for a dovish bias and hints at more asset purchases (to come in December) this should not catch markets off guard,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.

Also of interest later in the session will be a reading of how the , the world’s largest, performed in the third quarter, as well as earnings from tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Facebook (NASDAQ: ).

Oil prices retreated Thursday, as traders returned to fretting about the outlook for global demand in the wake of the new Covid-driven restrictions in Europe after Hurricane Zeta hit the coast of Louisiana and weakened.

Additionally, U.S. Energy Information Administration Wednesday showed stockpiles rose by 4.3 million barrels last week, adding to worries about a potential supply glut.

U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $37.10 a barrel, while the international benchmark contract was down 0.7% at $39.36. Both contracts fell around 5% on Wednesday.

Elsewhere, were flat at $1,879.20/oz, while traded 0.1% lower at 1.1733.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/european-stocks-edge-higher-corporate-news-helps-ahead-of-ecb-2241794,0.066,0.847,0.087,0.9635

(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). will slash its global workforce by 15% over the next two years, an unprecedented culling by North America’s biggest oil explorer as it struggles to preserve dividends.

The cuts will include 1,900 U.S. jobs, mostly in Houston, as well as reductions in contractors and layoffs previously announced in Europe and Australia. Personnel reductions are Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods’s latest effort to curtail spending and halt the worst string of quarterly losses since Exxon assumed its modern form with the 1999 takeover of Mobil Corp.

“These actions will improve the company’s long-term cost competitiveness and ensure the company manages through the current unprecedented market conditions,” the company said in a statement on Thursday.

Exxon rose 3% to $32.51 at 12:34 p.m. in New York and was the day’s best-performing exploration stock in the S&P 500 Index.

Exxon’s total reduction will affect about 14,000 people, split between employees and contractors, spokesman Casey Norton said by email. The cuts will come through attrition, targeted redundancy programs in 2021, and scaled-back hiring in some countries.

Exxon’s Big Oil rivals are also cutting thousands of jobs in response to the pandemic-induced demand slump. BP (NYSE: ) Plc plans to slash 10,000 jobs, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc will cut as many as 9,000 roles and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ) has announced around 6,000 reductions.

Exxon’s workforce stood at about 88,000 people, including 75,000 in-house employees and the rest comprised of contractors, as of year-end 2019, Norton said.

Suburban Campus

In the U.S., the pain will be particularly acute at the suburban Houston location where Exxon opened a sprawling, glass-walled campus in 2014 to house 9,000 employees from exploration, chemicals and other units that had previously been dispersed throughout the metro area. The company’s corporate headquarters remains in the Dallas area.

The fact that Exxon is cutting at all is a sign of its weakened financial position compared to its former status as the S&P 500 Index’s biggest company less than a decade ago and a profit powerhouse used to riding out oil-price cycles.

This year’s downturn has been particularly damaging because it affected refining, usually a cushion in times of low oil prices, and because it came at a time when Exxon was already increasing borrowing to fund a large expansion program. The company was forced to retreat on these plans in April, reducing capital spending by $10 billion and delaying or scaling back most of major projects.

The stock has plunged more than 50% this year. Its dividend yield is now more than 10%, indicating that investors are anticipating a cut. Exxon maintained the quarterly payout on Wednesday, and is expected to post its third consecutive quarterly loss when it reports earnings tomorrow.

Investing.com -- Big Tech reports in the shape of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: ); the U.S. will publish third-quarter GDP figures that will break records but not bring GDP back to where it was before the pandemic; weekly jobless claims will give a more up-to-date look at the state of the economy; the European Central Bank meets a day after France and Germany tightened their public health measures to stop the coronavirus, and central banks became net sellers of gold for the first time in a decade in the third quarter. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, October 29th.

1. Big Tech Earnings

It’s peak earnings season, with Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet all reporting after the close. The earnings again come only a day after some of their CEOs were in Congress, the timing thus sparing them the embarrassment of having to defend their monopoly profits at a time of widespread hardship across the economy.

The sell-off in Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) stock after it beat expectations on Tuesday night has generated some caution among analysts, amid signs that investors are starting to worry about sky-high valuations for a bunch of Big Tech names that have been seen by many as a safe haven from the rout elsewhere in the market this year.

Of interest to Apple may be news overnight that rival Samsung (KS: ) posted its biggest profit in 18 months, thanks to a rebound in smartphone sales and strong demand for memory chips. The company is also positioning itself to substitute for Huawei in parts of the wireless networks business.

2. Q3 GDP, jobless claims due

The U.S. will report figures for the third quarter at 8:30 AM ET, along with the weekly report.

Of the two, there’s no question which is the more important as regards the current dynamic of the economy: the weekly jobless numbers are much more up to date and have a more direct impact on consumer and voter sentiment with less than a week to go before the elections.

However, it’s the GDP figures that will likely grab more attention, if only because of the exaggerated numbers generated by annualizing the numbers. Analysts expect an annualized increase of 31% that, while unprecedented in superficial terms, still won’t bring actual GDP back up to its pre-pandemic level.

If anyone still has attention to spare after that, data are due at 10 AM ET.

3. Stocks set for weak bounce; old economy updates supportive

U.S. stocks are set to open with the weakest of bounces after their worst day in four months on Wednesday, helped by some reassuring corporate updates overnight but still overshadowed by the spread of the Covid-19 virus across the U.S. and Europe.

By 7:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), were up 63 points, or 0.2%, while were up 0.4% and were up 0.7%.

Even before the Big Tech earnings-fest this evening, there are plenty of updates to grab the attention: Comcast (NASDAQ: ) beat expectations thanks in part to a strong debut for its Peacock streaming service, while Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE: ) rose 3.2% in Europe after reporting strong sales in the U.S. and Brazil that overshadowed a dividend cut. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) meanwhile raised its dividend, only six months after an epoch-making cut.

Shopify (NYSE: ) and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: ) also reported stronger-than-expected sales for the quarter, while Tiffany's (NYSE: ) deal with LVMH (OTC: ) will go ahead after the two sides agreed a modest cut in LVMH’s offer price.

4. ECB set to meet as BoJ cuts growth forecast

The European Central Bank meets in Frankfurt, with the big question being whether it will react immediately to the tightening of restrictions on economic and social life in Germany and France that was announced on Wednesday.

Consensus is still that the ECB will wait until December to announce any new moves. But to keep markets happy, Christine Lagarde may signal an increase in bond purchases through the 1.35 trillion euro ($1.5 trillion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program at her , which begins at 9:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).

Overnight, the Bank of Japan made no change to its monetary policy, but said the Japanese economy will shrink by 5.5% in the year through March, more than the 4.7% contraction it had previously forecast.

5. Central banks sell gold for first time in a decade

Central banks were net sellers of gold in the third quarter for the first time in over a decade, cashing in on the record high prices created by investor demand for hedging against pandemic risks.

According to the World Gold Council, the central banks of Turkey and Uzbekistan – both of which face intense balance of payments challenges – were the biggest sellers.

Central banks had fueled the rally in gold between 2014 and 2018, bolstering their reserves as confidence in the world economy led the previous rally in bullion to unwind. The other main pillar of demand for physical gold, from jewelry buyers in China and India, has also weakened markedly in recent months as prices have soared, the WGC said. Indian jewelry demand, in particular, was down by around 50%.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/gdp-jobless-claims-ecb-and-big-tech-earnings--whats-up-in-markets-2241975,0.058,0.867,0.075,0.9678

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) on Thursday raised its dividend after easily beating quarterly profit forecasts and CEO Ben van Beurden said the group's oil output probably peaked in 2019 as he spearheads a transition to low-carbon energy.

The Anglo-Dutch company hit record earnings from its vast retail division, despite the impact on demand of the COVID-19 pandemic, which it said continued to generate ""significant uncertainty"".

In a sign of renewed confidence in its short and long-term outlook, Shell said it would boost its dividend on an annual basis only six months after it cut the payout for the first time since the 1940s.

""We are starting a new era of dividend growth,"" van Beurden told reporters in a call.

The company's shares, which have lagged peers, rose 3.2% by 1000 GMT.

Shell is planning a major restructuring as part of ""a complete overhaul"" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.

In line with plans to shrink its oil and gas portfolio, it said on Thursday it would cut back its oil refineries from 14 sites to six ""energy and chemical parks"".

Van Beurden said that 2019 was likely the ""high point"" of Shell's oil production, when it reached around 1.7 million barrels per day, as it shifts more capital to the renewables, hydrogen and power business.

It named nine hubs for oil and gas production: Brazil, Brunei, Gulf of Mexico, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Oman, Permian and Britain's North Sea.

Shell also plans to shed up to 9,000 jobs, or more than 10% of its workforce.

Shell's shares have dropped by more than 60% so far this year, more than any other major oil company, as investors fret over the impact of the pandemic on energy demand and the long-term energy transition.

But following its strong quarterly results, Shell outlined a long-term plan to reduce debt to $65 billion and to aim for shareholder distributions of 20-30% of cash flow. Its debt at the end of September was $73.5 billion, down from $77.8 billion in the previous quarter.

Shell's capital investment will remain between $19 and $22 billion in the near term while it targets annual divestments of $4 billion.

Shell's peer BP (L: ) on Tuesday reported forecast-beating profit, but has no plans to raise its dividend after cutting it earlier this year. Eni posted a third-quarter loss on Wednesday, also leaving its dividend at diminished levels.

Shell's adjusted earnings: https://graphics.reuters.com/SHELL-RESULTS/qzjpqamxlpx/chart.png

Shell said the pandemic's impact on demand has extended into the fourth quarter, with refining expected to run at 69% to 77% of capacity.

""As a result of COVID-19, there continues to be significant uncertainty in the macroeconomic conditions with an expected negative impact on demand for oil, gas and related products,"" Shell said in a statement.

Its adjusted earnings in the third quarter fell 80% to $955 million, but easily beat company-provided average analysts forecasts of a $146 million profit.

Shell increased its quarterly dividend to 16.65 cents.

""Very strong performance from Shell, handsomely beating our and consensus estimates,"" Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint said in a note.

The results were driven by a record profit from Shell's marketing division, which includes the world's biggest retail network. Earnings in the segment were up 10% on the year at $1.6 billion for the quarter on 20% lower product sales than a year ago.

""We have more retail sites than our competitors and we serve more than 30 million customers every day... providing fuels, lubricants, electric vehicle charging points, food and even groceries,"" van Beurden told a conference call.

Shell, the world's biggest Liquefied trader, wrote down the value of its LNG portfolio by just under $1 billion in the quarter, focusing on its flagship Prelude project in Australia.

Shell had cut the value of its oil and gas assets, including Prelude, by $16.8 billion in the second quarter after sharply lowering its price outlook.

Investing.com -- When Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) cut its dividend for the first time since the Second World War earlier this year, the move appeared highly symbolic – an acknowledgement that the Covid-19 pandemic had changed the outlook for Big Oil not just for the current cycle, but forever.

But fast forward six months, and – lo, and behold! – Western Europe’s biggest oil and gas major is hiking its dividend again, with promises of more to come in future years. The payout was raised by 4% to 16.65 cents for the quarter, and CEO Ben van Beurden promised further increases in future.

Talking to Bloomberg TV, van Beurden touted the move as evidence of a successful ‘reset’, which has seen the company slash it capital spending budget from over $25 billion to less than $19 billion and pare back operating costs with similar aggression.

With costs reset at a lower level, van Beurden argued that the company can still pay a higher dividend and cut net debt, which had leaped in the second quarter. In the three months through September, Net debt fell to $73.5 billion, while gearing, which tracks debt against equity levels, fell to 31.4% from 32.7%.

The company reckons a net debt level of around $65 billion is commensurate with an AA debt rating that would allow it to borrow at rock-bottom rates for the foreseeable future, so evidence of progress to that level is clearly important.

But is it sustainable? Two arguments that suggest it is are that the company remains convinced of the future of liquefied , where it is one of the world’s dominant players, and which it sees growing at 3%-4%. Another is the progress it has made reorienting its downstream activities away from sub-scale refineries in Europe and other slow-growth regions. Van Beurden said that the handful of refineries that it keeps will be fully integrated into more viable product lines such as biofuels and petrochemicals.

Another reason for optimism is the – so far clear – determination of OPEC and its allies to risk a rerun of the debacle in the spring. While it hasn’t yet confirmed the move, the latest tightening of public health measures in Germany, France and much of the rest of Europe make it all but certain that the increase of 2 million barrels a day of output, scheduled for the start of next year, will be pushed back, supporting crude prices.

Last but not least – it’s not just Shell that is taking such action. Equinor, the Norwegian state-controlled major that is absolutely nobody’s idea of a red-blooded capitalist machine hell-bent on maximizing short-term returns, also said it would raise its dividend on Thursday, despite a decline in quarterly profit.

Even so, it’s hard to rid oneself of the suspicion that the move smacks of desperation. The record profit on fuel sales was due to exceptional weakness in crude prices in spring, and that will be hard to replicate. Moreover, global fuel demand is still running 15% below year-earlier levels (according to BP (NYSE: )), and global demand is set to peak much earlier than was expected before the pandemic. Even gas will find it increasingly hard to compete with renewables in the power space as technological improvements reduce its current price advantage.

Shell’s fall from grace with dividend investors in the third quarter was brutal, and the stock is still down 60% this year despite a 2% rebound on Thursday. At the new level, the dividend yield is an implicit 4.74%. That’s still well below where it was pre-Covid, but at least back up to a level that institutional investors could see as a good entry point - if they can bring themselves to forgive van Beurden for the earlier carnage.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-shell-hopes-for-the-best-and-raises-its-dividend-again-2241888,0.107,0.784,0.109,0.796

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen mixed Thursday, amid caution after the hefty selloff of the previous session as the earnings season continues at a hectic pace, with a key gauge of economic growth set to be released later.

At 6:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), traded 5 points, or 0.2%, lower, the contract fell 111 points, or 0.4%, while climbed 34 points, or 0.3%.

The closed 3.4% lower Wednesday, at a three-month low, while the index lost 3.5%, and the index fell 3.7%, both to one-month lows. The Dow has closed lower four days in a row, its longest losing streak since February, and these indices are on course for their worst week in seven months.

Confidence is fragile with five days to go before the presidential election, amid worries over rising numbers of coronavirus infections and tougher lockdowns with little chance of a new stimulus package in the near future.

Investors looking for positive catalysts will look to the ongoing earnings season, with a total of 70 companies from the S&P 500 due to report Thursday.

The oil sector has had a dreadful time during the pandemic. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ) is due to report before the bell, after European rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) raised its dividend earlier Thursday as it reported a larger-than-expected profit for the third quarter.

A number of the big tech giants are scheduled to report earnings after Thursday’s closing bell, including Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: ).

Investors will also be looking for some good news from the preliminary estimate of U.S. third quarter , due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Forecasts are calling for a record rebound of 31.9% after a historic 31.4% plunge in the second quarter as the coronavirus pandemic caused the economy to slump.

The weekly report on will also be closely watched amid concerns that the recovery in the labor market is slowing.

Oil prices retreated Thursday, as traders returned to fretting about the outlook for global demand in the wake of the new Covid-driven restrictions in Europe after the impact of Hurricane Zeta weakened.

Additionally, U.S. Energy Information Administration Wednesday showed stockpiles rose by 4.3 million barrels last week, adding to worries about a potential supply glut.

U.S. crude futures traded 4.3% lower at $35.80 a barrel, while the international benchmark contract was down 3.9% at $38.06. Both contracts fell around 5% on Wednesday.

HOUSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - After years of focusing on U.S. shale, Chevron Corp (N: ) is staking its future on the Middle East, a volatile and divided region where energy majors have long tread warily.

CEO Michael Wirth's pivot away from home is underpinned by a bet that the Middle East is entering an era of reconciliation that will make it ideal for tapping natural gas, as demand for the cheaper and cleaner fuel is forecast to outstrip oil.

The new strategy is seeing the company pitch new gas deals in Egypt, Israel, Qatar, while cutting spending on American shale exploration.

The plan is anchored by Wirth's $11.8 billion (9.1 billion pounds) purchase this month of U.S.-based Noble Energy, which holds a stake of about 40% in the aptly-named Leviathan gas field in the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of Israel.

""Five years ago the Eastern Med wasn't viewed as endowed from a resource standpoint as I think most people would say today. That's a fundamental shift,"" Wirth told Reuters in an interview.

""There's not a lot of capital investment required in the near term,"" he said. ""At a time when cash flow matters, that's a very appealing attribute.""

The deal brings an alliance with Israel that has been smoothed by the narrowing of some historical rifts in the region, such as the establishment of formal ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates in an agreement signed last month.

Wirth said Middle Eastern commercial and diplomatic relations ""are becoming more codified and stronger, that's a trend that we think augurs well for the region.""

Chevron also made a courtesy call about the Noble deal to officials in Saudi Arabia, a key partner in several Chevron oil projects and a nation with historically strained relations with Israel, according to a senior source at the U.S. company.

The Saudi government media communications office did not respond to a request for comment, while Chevron said it did not discuss details of meetings.

RISKS AND RENEWABLES

Yet the regional political and security risks that have deterred some companies in recent years still exist.

Syria and Yemen are riven by wars, with uncertain consequences for a wider region where archrivals Saudi Arabia and Iran are waging a proxy battle.

Just this January, the U.S. killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in Iraq - and a reprisal by Tehran - illustrated the instability of the Middle East and threatened to engulf it in conflict.

Despite such risks, Chevron - which at one point leap-frogged rival ExxonMobil (NYSE: ) this month to be the largest U.S. oil company by market value - is plowing ahead with efforts across the region.

The Leviathan field and others nearby have the potential to become major factors in regional fuel supplies. Chevron could send gas to a Egyptian liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant that could ship the fuel to Europe or Asia, Wirth said.

European and Asian nations have been moving toward gas, solar and wind, and away from coal and nuclear power.

""The reality is you need gas in tandem with renewables,"" said Christopher Kalnin, CEO of Banpu Kalnin Ventures, which invests in U.S. shale gas. Asia in particular will remain dependent on imported gas, he said, because it complements solar and wind.

Global gas demand through 2025 is projected to rise 1.5% per year on average, largely on growing purchases by customers in China and India.

In contrast, oil consumption may have already peaked at last year's 100 million barrel per day (bpd) level, forecasters say, and this year could sink to 91.7 million bpd, a seven-year low.

PERMIAN COST-CUTTING

The Middle East produces a third of the world's oil and one sixth of its natural gas, and has long drawn the interest of foreign oil companies. Chevron produces fewer barrels of oil and gas in the region than other majors, according to Rystad Energy data, but it is the only major to have had a continuous presence in Saudi Arabia for 70 years and has maintained good relations with governments in the region.

""Chevron is extremely good at what I would call crown jewel government relations, big assets in challenging countries,"" said Robin West, a board member of Spanish oil major Repsol SA (MC: ) and head of Boston Consulting Group's Center for Energy Impact. ""They very quietly work away at things.""

The Noble deal fits Wirth's effort to adapt to a low-cost energy world and expand in Qatar, Egypt and Iraq. It brought Chevron nearly 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, and ensures it remains among the world's top 10 gas suppliers.

""The size of the opportunity was way beyond the capacity of a company like Noble,"" said a former Chevron executive who declined to be identified because of ongoing relationships.

The purchase may help Chevron's bid for a stake in Qatar's LNG production expansion, where it is competing with Exxon, Shell (LON: ) and Total SA (PA: ), among others. Chevron also recently signed a preliminary agreement for oil exploration in southern Iraq.

Wirth cautioned that negotiations were ongoing: ""There's no certainty of outcome on either of those.""

Wirth has, meanwhile, intensified his cost-cutting at home.

Chevron has slashed its spending in the top U.S. shale field by half, to around $2 billion this year. It had just four active drilling rigs in the Permian Basin as of September, down from 16 in March, according to consultancy Rystad Energy.

Investing.com -- Crude oil prices fell sharply on Monday in line with other risk assets as the rapid spread of the Covid-19 virus across Europe and the U.S. sparked fears of more demand destruction through restrictions on economic and social activity.

By 11:35 AM ET (1635 GMT), futures were down 3.1% at $38.61 a barrel, their lowest level in three weeks. The international benchmark blend was down 2.8% at $40.88 a barrel, having also hit a three-week low.

U.S. gasoline RBOB futures were down 2.5% at $1.0991 a gallon, testing their lowest in over a month. Data from GasBuddy showed that U.S. demand for gasoline fell by 0.5% last week.

Sentiment was summed up by Patrick Pouyanne, the chief executive of French oil and gas major Total, who told a conference that “globally speaking, the demand is still weak.

“I am afraid that with the second wave we are experiencing in many continents today again, it could be longer [for demand] to recover like everybody hoped,” Pouyanne was quoted by Argus Media as telling the CERA Week conference.

The pressure on the corporate sector was again in evidence, with Canada’s Cenovus and Husky Energy (OTC: ) announcing plans to merge over the weekend in a bid to rationalize costs and squeeze more value out of reserves that require relatively high investment to be monetized.

However, as usual, there was no shortage of those willing to talk prices up. Saudi Arabia’s Oil Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman was quoted as telling the same conference as Pouyanne that the essentially cyclical nature of the oil business was unchanged, and that low prices and low capital spending now would beget high prices in the future.

In the same vein, Indian Oil Corp. Chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya told S&P Global Platts in an interview that Indian product demand is now rebounding strongly after a wretched couple of months due to the virus. India has one of the world’s highest death tolls from Covid-19, after the U.S.

Likewise, OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo hinted CERA Week that the OPEC+ bloc of producers that a deferral of a scheduled increase in output at the end of the year is still possible, stressing that that the group will “adapt to the changing realities.""

""We are determined to assist the market to restore stability by ensuring that the stock drawdowns continue.""

There was little visible effect however from signs of yet another disruption to production in the Gulf of Mexico, where BHP, Chevron (NYSE: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and BP (NYSE: ) had all started to remove non-essential personnel from their platforms ahead of the likely arrival of Tropical Storm Zeta.

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (L: ) is set to make around 7,500 compulsory redundancies after roughly 2,500 staff - or just over one in ten of those eligible - applied for voluntary severance, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters and company sources.

The oil major announced plans in June to lay off almost 15% its 70,000-strong workforce as part of Chief Executive Bernard Looney's plan to cut costs and ""reinvent"" the business for a low carbon future.

Many layoffs will come from office-based staff including BP's core oil and gas exploration and production division, where thousands of engineers, geologists and scientists are set to leave. They will not impact frontline production facilities.

A BP spokesman confirmed the voluntary redundancy figure.

""We are continuing to make progress towards fully defining our new organisation ... We expect the process to complete and for all staff to know their positions in the coming months,"" BP said in a statement.

The oil industry is facing one of its biggest ever crises, with a collapse in demand and oil prices due to the COVID-19 pandemic and pressure from activists and investors to help battle climate change.

In an internal memo this week, BP said that out of 23,600 people eligible for voluntary redundancy, some 2,500 had applied, including about 500 people in senior roles.

""This means around a quarter of the headcount reduction that Bernard outlined in June, will be voluntary,"" the memo said.

""We know that for some people for various reasons they feel that now is the right time for them to leave BP - but for many it will still have been a difficult decision,"" the memo said.

Looney has promised to cut oil and gas output by 40% by the end of this decade, a radical pledge for an energy company, as he seeks to dramatically expand renewables production such as offshore wind and solar.

Investors have praised the drive, but also questioned the financial viability of the plan as renewables generate much lower returns.

BP's shares currently trade at their lowest since 1995, when it was a much smaller company, and its dividend yield stands at a staggering 13%.

Its shares were up 1.5% at 1125 GMT.

BP said voluntary redundancies were offered to people in offices across 21 countries. Its biggest offices are in London and Aberdeen in Britain, Houston in the United States, Baku in Azerbaijan, Luanda in Angola, and Oman and Trinidad and Tobago.

Two BP sources said the company considered more than 10% of those eligible accepting voluntary redundancy as a good turnout. Employees were typically offered one month's salary for every year of service.

Forced redundancies will now be based on internal scores and rankings.

""Losers get a package and will walk out by the end of the year ... Staff choice is brutal,"" one of the sources said.

A second source said the biggest challenge would be for the long timers to try to fill new roles requiring skills and knowledge of the renewables business.

""If you are an oil reservoir engineer chances are just minimal that you can be retrained as a solar panel engineer,"" the second source said.

Speaking to Reuters earlier this week, Gordon Birrell, BP's head of operations, which includes oil and gas production and refining, said many of the jobs cuts would come from his division.

""The transformation of production and operations is significant, very significant - 10,000 people will leave the company and we're in the midst of the process - a significant proportion of the overall number are from production and operations,"" Birrell said.

The FTSE 100’s recent stock market crash has led to greater caution among many investors. As such, they may consider buying other assets when seeking to build a retirement portfolio that can reduce their reliance on the State Pension.

However, the index’s low price level could mean there are buying opportunities on offer. Over time, they could produce impressive returns that improve your prospects of generating a generous passive income in older age.

With that in mind, here are two large-cap stocks that appear to offer good value for money and long-term recovery potential after their recent declines. They could boost your retirement prospects as part of a diverse range of stocks.

A FTSE 100 turnaround opportunity FTSE 100 oil and gas shares such as Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) have experienced a hugely challenging 2020. The deteriorating prospects for the world economy have led to a declining oil price. This is having a negative impact on the company’s financial performance.

In response, the business is cutting up to 9,000 staff members as part of a wider plan to reduce costs. For example, it reduced operating expenditure by $1.1bn and capital expenditure by $1.4bn in the most recent quarter. As well as this, it is aiming to shift its investment focus towards low-carbon assets that could help it to generate a more sustainable rate of profit growth over the long run.

Looking ahead, Shell’s uncertain operating conditions could make it a more volatile stock than many of its peers. However, its 58% share price decline since the start of the year could mean that investors have factored in many of the risks it faces. As such, with cost reductions and a change in strategy ahead, it may offer long-term recovery potential.

A large-cap income opportunity Many FTSE 100 shares have cut their dividends this year. As such, defensive stocks such as British American Tobacco (LSE: LON: ) could become more popular in a low-interest-rate environment.

The company has a yield of around 8%. It appears to be affordable, with the firm targeting a 65% dividend payout ratio. Its defensive business model may also make it more appealing in an era of economic uncertainty.

British American Tobacco continues to invest in non-combustible products such as e-cigarettes that could gradually account for a greater share of its revenue. Already, they contribute around 10% of its sales and could provide a long-term growth opportunity for the business.

The company’s stable earnings growth forecasts may increase its appeal among investors at a time when many FTSE 100 shares are struggling to post positive sales and profit growth. As such, it could offer impressive total returns in the coming years through rising demand for its shares and the reinvestment of its generous dividend payouts.

BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio XOM -2.14% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (L: ) swung back to a small profit in the third quarter but warned the pace of recovery from the pandemic remains uncertain and continued to weigh on fuel demand and refining profits.

The London-based company said that while fuel demand in Asia, particularly in China, was recovering, global consumption remained weak so far in the fourth quarter.

BP's shares are down more than 50% this year and remain near 25-year lows, battered by weak oil prices and investor concerns about BP's ability to successfully shift to renewable energy from fossil fuels.

The coronavirus crisis will however not slow BP's transition plans, Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss told Reuters.

""It is hard to imagine the environment being much more brutal than it was in the third quarter,"" Auchincloss said, even if the fourth quarter ""is not materially different.""

BP reported a $86 million (66 million pounds) underlying replacement cost profit, the company's definition of net income, for the three months to Sept. 30, beating analysts' expectations of a loss of $120 million. It followed a record $6.7 billion loss in the previous quarter, when it also halved its dividend.

Weak fuel demand continued to weigh on refining profit margins, with BP refineries operating at 80% of capacity, he added. Fuel demand remains around 15% below pre-crisis levels.

BP's refining margin of $6.20 per barrel was up slightly from the previous quarter but less than half of what it was a year earlier.

The results were boosted by higher oil prices and stronger trading results, though oil trading was ""significantly lower"" than the previous quarter, BP said.

Refining and trading typically help offset weak oil and gas prices. But BP and its peers hit a perfect storm this year when the coronavirus epidemic led to both sharp drops in oil and gas prices and fuel demand.

""Despite the difficult macro backdrop, this was a strong underlying performance from BP,"" Credit Suisse (SIX: ) analyst Thomas Adolff said in a note.

BP shares were up 1.6% by 0817 GMT.

RESTRUCTURING

BP plans to increase its renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030 while reducing its oil output by 40% and diverting more funds to low-carbon investments.

The London-based company also plans to lay off around 10,000 employees, or roughly 15% of its global workforce at a cost of around $1.4 billion spread over the next few quarters.

But investors have welcomed the new strategy cautiously amid concerns that BP's won't be able to hit its targeted profit margins in the transition.

BP slightly reduced its debt in the quarter and said it expected a further decline in the fourth quarter as a result of asset sales.

Its debt-to-equity ratio, or gearing, including leases, was 37.7% at the end of September, flat on the quarter and up from 35.9% a year ago.

Rivals including Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) have also seen their market values fall in recent months. They will report later this week.

How investors learned to stop worrying and bought cheap UK shares in the stock market crash

It may sound counterintuitive, but the best time to buy cheap UK shares is bang in the middle of a stock market crash. Your favourite companies are temporarily trading at knock-down prices, so you can pick them up on the cheap. All you need do then is wait for stock markets to recover, as history suggests they always do in the end.

It isn’t easy though. You have to defy the urge to panic and sell your shares along with everybody else. That’s challenging, especially when the TV and internet are pumping out terrifying headlines about a market meltdown. Happily, new research suggests Britons are rising to that challenge.

Instead of worrying and selling UK shares when markets crash, investors have learned to buy them while they are cheap. When Covid-19 struck, the number of ordinary private investors buying company stocks spiked. Impressively, 1.5m people bought shares for the first time in their lives, according to a survey by specialist exchange-traded fund provider GraniteShares.

Stock market crash is a great buying opportunity The biggest motivation, named by 30%, was because UK shares fell dramatically, and the chance to buy cheap stocks wasn’t to be missed. They got that right, with the rebounding more than 20% from its March lows.

Another 25% said they wanted to take advantage of increased share price volatility. That also makes sense, because when markets are volatile you can find top UK stocks trading at dirt-cheap valuations,

A further 22% bought when share prices started to rise dramatically, because they didn’t want to miss out. There’s a whiff of herd mentality about this one, but if you buy UK shares in the early stages of the recovery, it can still pay off.

When shopping for cheap UK shares, always keep your eye on the long term. At The Motley Fool, we encourage people to buy and hold shares for decades, to steadily build their wealth for their retirement. Never trade in the hope of making a fast buck.

Unfortunately, GraniteShares’ research shows many investors are doing exactly that. Worryingly, 11% were trading because they could no longer bet on sporting events that had been cancelled. Investing is a long-term process, not a short-term flutter. You should aim to build a balanced portfolio of FTSE 100 dividend and growth stocks, to reduce the risk if one underperforms. Making short-term trades usually backfires.

Buy cheap UK shares for the long term Most alarmingly, 11% were trading because they’d been made redundant and wanted to make money. Now that really does worry me. You should never try to trade your way out of financial problems.

Investors cannot resist cheap UK shares. Many are buying stricken engineering firm Rolls-Royce (LON: ), GraniteShares says. Fallen banks Barclays (LON: ) and Lloyds Banking Group (LON: ) are also popular, as are troubled energy giants BP (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ). All look tempting at today’s valuations, but please, understand the risks.

Others are buying US tech stocks such as electric car maker Tesla Motors, online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Right now, I’m targeting cheap UK shares. Thanks to the stock market crash, there are plenty of them out there.

Investing.com -- Mounting fears that a surge in new coronavirus cases would derail the economic recovery weighed heavily on stocks on Wednesday, causing a more than 940-point rout in the Dow.

New infections in the U.S. have reached all-time highs this week as public health officials struggle to ring-fence the virus. Hot spots have spread across the country and hospitalizations are rising. Many fear new lockdowns, which would follow new restrictions imposed in Europe in a fresh wave of the pandemic there.

Selling was broad-based, with the , and each down more than 3%.

The mood was darkened by the reality that stimulus was not forthcoming, at least not until after next week’s election. Without a new round of money injected into the economy to support spending, the economic recovery could be in peril, according to recent speeches by officials from the Federal Reserve.

The heavy selling pressure comes during a big week for corporate earnings reports. More are on tap for Thursday, especially big oil companies and four of the Fab 5 tech companies.

Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:

1. Profits from the oil majors

Oil prices have plunged this week on worries that demand is not coming back, or is returning unevenly as the pandemic refuses to disappear. On Wednesday the government released data that showed inventories rose more than expected, to 4.3 million barrels last week.

Oil majors are reporting earnings and analysts will be listening closely to what they say about the remainder of the year and their prospects for next year. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ) is expected to report a loss of 31 cents a share on revenue of $5.2 billion, while Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) PLC ADR (NYSE: ) is expected to eke out earnings per share of 4 cents on revenue of more than $46 billion.

2. Big tech storms Wall Street after hours

Most of the so-called FANG gang is reporting earnings at practically the same time after Thursday’s closing bell.

Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc Class C (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report earnings of $11.30 a share on revenue of $42.7 billion, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report EPS of $7.37 on revenue of $92.6 billion, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report EPS of 71 cents a share on revenue of just under $64 billion, and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: ) is seen reporting $1.89 a share on revenue of $19.7 billion.

The estimates are based on analysts tracked by Investing.com.

3. Starbucks reveals how pandemic has altered coffee-drinking habits

Has the pandemic significantly altered coffee-drinking habits, or have people maintained their caffeine fixes despite inconveniences like not being able to camp out for hours with their laptops without ordering refills?

This is the question for Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: ), which is seen reporting earnings of 31 cents a share on revenue of $6 billion. The Seattle-based coffee selling giant was forced to make changes to its stores to encourage drive-up service and mobile ordering. Analysts will be listening to hear what the company says about foot traffic.

(Bloomberg) --

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc raised its dividend and pledged to grow the payout steadily, just six months after slashing it for the first time since the Second World War.

Amid a painful year for Big Oil, the Anglo-Dutch energy giant offered investors some good news. It also reported a larger-than-expected profit for the third quarter, even as most of its divisions continued to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.

Shell’s dividend will grow by 4% to 16.65 cents a share for the quarter, and increase annually thereafter, the company said in a statement on Thursday.

“Our sector-leading cash flows will enable us to grow our businesses of the future while increasing shareholder distributions, making us a compelling investment case,” Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in the statement.

Shell’s adjusted net income was $955 million in the third quarter, down 80% from the same period a year ago, but better than even the highest analyst estimate.

By Kate Abnett

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering binding standards for to limit emissions of methane, the second-largest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide.

The 27-member bloc is the world's biggest importer of gas, and imposing such standards could affect its major suppliers, which include Russia and Norway..

Published on Wednesday, the EU methane strategy includes a clearer commitment than previous drafts, which shied away from methane limits on gas consumed in Europe. It said any legislation would follow an impact assessment involving international partners.

""The Commission will consider methane emission reduction targets, standards or other incentives for fossil energy consumed and imported in the EU in the absence of significant commitments from international partners,"" the policy said.

Curbing methane is key to plans to cut EU greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. However, that target does not capture the emissions released to produce or transport gas to the EU, whereas methane standards for imported gas would.

Methane, which is emitted from leaky oil and gas pipelines and infrastructure, unused coal mines and farming, is 84 times more potent than CO2 in its first 20 years in the atmosphere.

Some campaigners welcomed the push to tackle imported emissions, but Green EU lawmakers lamented the lack of legislation on agriculture, where most methane emissions come from livestock farming.

""Effective manure management should be made mandatory for farms with bigger livestock,"" German lawmaker Jutta Paulus said.

The Commission will propose legislation next year requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and report methane emissions and repair leaks.

It will consider banning venting and flaring, which release methane into the atmosphere or deliberately burn it.

Companies including Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) have set voluntary targets to curb methane emissions, and the International Energy Agency says a third of such emissions could be saved at no net cost, as the captured gas could be sold.

Satellite data has shown methane emissions significantly higher than levels reported by industry. The Commission said it will help launch an independent international body to gather data, supported by EU satellites.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/eu-considers-binding-methane-emissions-standards-for-gas-2232388,0.027,0.902,0.071,0.9319

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft (MM: ) and producer Rosneft (MM: ) have reached a settlement with Total (PA: ) over dirty oil supplies to the French company's Leune refinery in Germany, Transneft said on Tuesday.

Up to 5 million tonnes of Russian oil en route to central Europe via the Druzhba pipeline were found to be contaminated last year. Total declared a force majeure in June 2019 on the production of jet fuel at its Leuna refinery in Germany following the supply of contaminated crude from Russia.

Transneft did not disclose how much compensation would be paid to Total.

The pipeline operator, headed by Nikolai Tokarev, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had said it would pay compensation of no more than $15 per barrel.

It had been agreed that buyers such as BP (L: ), Shell (L: ), Total, Eni (MI: ) and PKN Orlen (WA: ) would put forward claims to Russian suppliers, while Transneft agreed to bear the brunt of the contamination-related costs.

Russian exporters, such as Rosneft, would then address buyers' claims to Transneft for compensation.

Transneft has compensated Hungary's MOL (BU: ) and all the Kazakh companies affected by contamination in its pipelines.

1 FTSE 100 stock with a 7%+ dividend yield that I think income investors should buy

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio VOD -0.85% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Finding dividend income this year has been particularly challenging. Some businesses such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) paid out dividends to investors for decades, only to see it heavily cut earlier this year. Shell is just one example, there are plenty of others within the that have done the same in order to aid cash flow as consumer demand has slowed. Despite this, there remain FTSE 100 stocks with attractive dividend yields that are still being paid.

As a case in point, take a look at Vodafone (LSE: LON: ). The telecoms giant has a larger global presence than some are aware of. It has extensive operations in both Africa and Asia, as well as its business here in the UK. With a dividend yield currently sitting at 7.34%, I think it’s worth a buy.

Why the high dividend yield? Over the past decade, the dividend yield for Vodafone has averaged around 5%. In the past couple of years, this has been increasing, partly due to the falling share price (the FTSE 100 stock has slumped around 25% this year alone). This boosts the dividend yield because the share price is the denominator when calculating that yield.

Income investors had already been disappointed by Vodafone in the last year, when a near-10% dividend yield was reduced and the payout was cut by 40%.

And a cut is always a risk. In fact, any FTSE 100 stock with a dividend yield above 10% should sound warning bells for investors in my opinion. At a time when the base rate of interest is at 0.1%, there simply isn’t the need for that big a premium from a dividend-paying firm.

With a yield above 7%, investors do still need to be cautious, but I don’t think we’re going to see another payout cut or cancellation in the short term.

Checking the fundamentals Full-year results in May confirmed that the dividend for this year would be paid. If the board was concerned about cash flow, that would have been the perfect time to reduce the dividend, but it wasn’t. Free cash flow actually increased by over 10% to €4.9bn.

Another reason why the dividend is likely to stay is that the firm needs to maintain a strong market capitalisation. This is so that Vodafone can easily raise money if it needs to from the equity markets. Current debt levels stand at an eye-watering €42.2bn.

A firm may not want a very high share price as this hampers the price-to-earnings ratio, but at the same time, it wants a solid share price in order to make other financial ratios look attractive to lenders. By offering an attractive dividend yield, income investors will likely buy into the stock. This won’t stop the share price from falling completely, but will help to stem the slump.

Risk versus reward I feel that a FTSE 100 stock with a dividend yield at 7% is OK on the risk/reward balance scale. Vodafone isn’t a completely safe business, as shown by the large debt levels. Yet if you want income at a safe firm, then you’re looking at dividend yields around 2%-4%. So from my angle, investing in Vodafone is a risk worth taking.

Like just about every sector in the world, oil stocks plummeted as a result of this year’s market crash. Since then, the share price of two of the FTSE 100’s biggest companies has followed a similar path.

Both Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) and BP (LSE: LON: ) took a hit in mid-March, before a rise at the end of the month. Aside from a shared spike on June 8th, the competing oil stocks have been on a relatively consistent downturn since then.

But is this an opportunity to buy cheap, or the start of something worrying?

Which Oil Stock To Buy? On one hand, BP is making a lot of progress. Oil stocks could be hit massively by changing attitudes to climate change, so the company’s commitment to increasing low-carbon investments by 1,000% in the next 10 years and becoming carbon-neutral by 2050 are promising for the long term.

On top of this, it plans to cut costs by $2.5bn by the end of 2021, with a halving of its dividend and the reduction of 10,000 jobs already having contributed to this. Its debt is also down by an impressive $10bn since Q1.

Having said this, BP’s second-quarter earnings were, like most oil stocks, poor. In comparison to a $2.8bn profit during the same period a year earlier, the company reported a loss of $6.7bn. This is reflected in a share price reduction of 26% since the publication of its Q2 results, and a 56% reduction in the last 12 months.

BP’s third-quarter trading update is just around the corner, so we’ll soon get an insight into the implications of a turbulent summer.

Cash Flow Positive Like BP, Royal Dutch Shell had a rough second-quarter, so its reported earnings paint a grim picture. A loss of more than $18bn and a $3bn debt increase between Q1 and Q2 2020 certainly didn’t help its share price. As a result, it has dropped by around 10% since the results were released, while it is down 56% over the last year, just like BP.

Understandably, Paul Summers views Shell as a risk, but I’m a little more positive about the future of oil stocks and this giant.

The company is doing well to reduce costs, including reducing its OPEX (operating expenditures: the day-to-day running of the company) by $1.1bn in comparison to Q1, and reducing its CAPEX (capital expenditures: long-term developments) by $1.4bn in the same period.

This has helped contribute to a positive cash flow of $243m, with CEO Ben van Deurden providing the confident suggestion that its “high-quality integrated portfolio, disciplined execution and forward-looking strategy enable sustained competitive free cash flow generation.”

The performance of oil stocks is always tough to predict, but Shell seems to be moving in the right direction. Its Q3 results will also be released at the end of October.

On The Whole Despite the current decline in their share prices, both of these oil stocks seem like promising investments that are in good enough health to weather a potential second lockdown and recover well.

However, with its commitment to green energy and a slightly steeper recent fall in share price, I think an investment in BP at this low price has the potential to provide better returns with more long-term safety than Shell.

OSLO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (O: ) has signed a memorandum of understanding with Norway's Equinor (OL: ) to explore the use of a carbon dioxide storage facility as the tech firm seeks to erase its carbon footprint, it said on Wednesday.

The world's largest software company pledged in January to remove enough CO2 by 2050 to account for all its emissions since its founding in 1975, and to invest $1 billion in a carbon removal technology.

Microsoft will become a technology partner in the Northern Lights project, part of a wider Norwegian effort to develop carbon capture technology at industrial sites and store CO2 under the seabed, Equinor said at a news conference in Oslo.

""Our goal is not only to contribute our technology and know-how, but explore how new solutions like the Northern Lights project can help us meet our own carbon negative goals by 2030,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement.

The Northern Lights project is a partnership with Shell (L: ) and Total (PA: ).

The Norwegian government is expected to cover about 80% of the 6.9 billion Norwegian crown ($751 million) cost of the CO2 deposit's first stage, which would be able to store 1.5 million CO2 tonnes per year, Equinor has said.

""Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a proven technology and has the potential to play a key role in decarbonising energy and industries across sectors to meet international climate targets,"" Equinor executive Irene Rummelhoff said.

Microsoft's Smith told the news conference it was important to find new ways to pay for carbon to be removed and stored permanently.

""That's why this new technology is of such critical importance to a company like Microsoft,"" he said via video link.

""I believe we will be one of many companies... that would want to purchase the services for carbon to be removed, to be captured and to be stored,"" he said.

Some years, investing is all about the detail. Companies’ individual destinies drive their share prices. 2020 isn’t one of those years. It’s a year of the big picture. Even well-run or high-potential companies have been deeply impacted by macroeconomic factors like the pandemic, lockdowns, recession, and the stock market crash.

Relatedly, prices of oil and gold, and interest rates have become increasingly significant too, given the sharp movement seen in them. I think we can still make gains, however, if we adjust our investing sails to this change in wind, which I suspect will guide stock markets in the foreseeable future too.

#1. Stocks to beat the recession In this article I look at four of these macro drivers – recession, oil and gold prices, and interest rates – as the starting point for deciding where to invest. First, the recession. Technically, the UK is no longer in recession, and I for one am not entirely pessimistic about its prospects. But given the unpredictability of the times we are in, the possibility of falling back into it can’t be ruled out either. If there’s another recession or more likely, growth remains soft, I’d bet that defensives will continue to do well. Think about buying stocks like AstraZeneca and Unilever (LON: ) with this in mind.

#2. What to buy when oil prices fall Next, oil prices are closely tied to economic cycles. A slowdown, coupled with a steady move towards cleaner energy sources means that oil prices will remain subdued going forward. The International Energy Agency has revised down its oil demand forecasts for the remainder of 2020. As a result, big FTSE 100 oil companies like BP (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) can remain in an uncertain place. I’d counter this trend by investing in companies that support the electric vehicle trend like Johnson Matthey (LON: ) and Rio Tinto (LON: ).

#3. Riding the gold wave A soft economy and gold price increase go hand in hand. It follows that if we forecast that a slowdown will continue for now, the gold price should remain elevated. While there are many gold stocks to choose from, I’d focus on FTSE 100 precious metal producers like Polymetal International. It showed robust equity market performance even before the stock market crash. It also increased its dividend recently.

#4. Beneficiaries from low interest rates Last, consider interest rates. I don’t think there’s any dispute about the fact that low interest rates are bad news for banks. They are a response to poor economic conditions, which means lower credit demand in any case. Lower interest rates further reduce bank incomes. But, low interest rates also spur recovery. As the price of loans falls, both individuals and companies are encouraged to take on credit. I think real estate companies can benefit from this trend. Almost half of UK’s house ownership has been made possible through active mortgages, as per Bank of England numbers. I think FTSE 100 housebuilders like Persimmon (LON: ) and Barratt Developments (LON: ) are good examples of gainers from this trend.

These FTSE 350 shares have performed poorly over the last 12 months. Will they fall further or bounce back?

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HSBA -1.33% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio FTLC -0.29% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

These two shares have fallen because of the Covid-19 pandemic. For investors that raises one big question: are they now good value and primed to bounce back, or could there be further pain ahead?

A 350 share that could bounce back The share price of Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSA) has fallen by more than 55% over the last 12 months. Concerns over the price of oil, economic worries, fears over the future of the industry as environmental concerns move up the agenda, and lastly the cutting of the dividend, have all played a part in reducing the share price.

The falling share price means its shares have hit a 25-year low. The shares certainly appear cheap. They have a price-to-earnings of only around 6.

The risk is it will likely take a while for sentiment to return. However, oil has been out of favour before and share prices have bounced back. There’s still demand for oil, despite the focus on the green alternatives and Shell itself is keen to get involved in green and alternative energy. I think though it’s still unclear if that will ever offset reducing demand for oil over time.

In the short term I don’t know what the share price will do. Longer term, I expect it’ll bounce back. The falls of the last 12 months could well make now an ideal buying time. Although, with analysts turning negative on the stock it’s not without significant risk.

A share price that might continue to struggle 2020 started so well for on-the-move food group Greggs (LSE: GRG). The share price was rising strongly and then came Covid-19. Since then the share price has retreated.

The group recently revealed that like-for-like sales in company-managed shops averaged 76.1% of 2019 levels in the four weeks to 26 September. Sales were 71.2% of the 2019 level in the 12 weeks to the same date.

What’s next? Given sentiment is driving the share price in the short term it’s hard to predict where the share price will go over the next 12 months. The pandemic will be in control of what happens.

Longer term, I see Greggs as less affected by the smaller number of workers commuting than similar companies such as SSP Group. It has many more locations at places like petrol stations and high streets and provides cheaper food. This should make it better positioned once we have a vaccine, or lockdowns become less frequent – but this may be some way off.

For now then, I’d avoid the shares and wait to see what happens. Given the shares have recently jumped back up, another fall could be just around the corner.

Looking at Royal Dutch Shell and Greggs, both have the potential to bounce back. I prefer Royal Dutch Shell as the one with the potential to recover quicker and provide investors with income and growth. But there is risk, as much of its long-term value lies in a successful transition to green energy, which will require huge investment.

By Jennifer Hiller and Devika Krishna Kumar

HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (N: ) employees worldwide are being asked to reapply for positions as part of a cost-cutting program expected to eliminate up to 15% of its workforce, people familiar with the matter said.

The No. 2 U.S. oil producer has begun taking steps to streamline its organization this year to reduce costs and revive declining profits. Oil companies have posted huge losses on asset writedowns and slashed spending as economic downturns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic undercut fuel demand.

Employees who are not chosen for jobs should know within weeks, Chief Executive Michael Wirth said in an interview on Monday. He did not discuss how cuts would be decided nor how many employees were asked to reapply for positions.

The company took a $1 billion charge to earnings earlier this year to cover severance pay for employees affected by the restructuring. Workers not chosen for new assignments would lose their jobs.

Chevron recently expanded its 45,000-person workforce by acquiring smaller oil and gas producer Noble Energy, which has about 2,200 workers. That $4.1 billion all-stock deal closed this week.

In Houston, about 700 employees will lose jobs starting Oct. 23, according to a notice Chevron sent to the state of Texas. Employees will receive enhanced severance benefits and two-months to leave the company, the letter said. Most of the people not chosen for new posts will depart by the end of the year, a spokeswoman said.

Decisions about Noble employees are likely in several weeks, Wirth said. Reductions are more likely where the two companies overlap, such as west Texas shale and administrative areas, Wirth said.

""Some areas like the Middle East or like Colorado where we don't have much of an operating footprint, it's unlikely there's significant changes there in the near term,"" Wirth said. ""We're working through the details on that.""

Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) last month said it plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs, or over 10% of its workforce. BP Plc (L: ) this year also announced plans to cut around 10,000 jobs, as the two shift from oil and gas to lower-carbon energy sources.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/exclusive-chevron-workers-face-demands-to-reapply-for-jobs-under-global-restructuring--sources-2228549,0.054,0.866,0.08,0.8907

(Reuters) - A number of financial scandals, including allegations of fraud and suspect deals, have hit the energy and commodities sector following the slump in oil prices sparked by the coronavirus crisis, adding to those from recent years.

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - The slump in demand for crude during the coronavirus pandemic has forced oil companies to contemplate the possibility that the fossil fuel market has peaked and the time for a global energy transition has come.

But Saudi Aramco (SE: ) plans to boost its production capacity so it can pump as much of the kingdom's vast oil reserves when demand picks up - before a shift to cleaner energy makes crude all but worthless, industry sources and analysts told Reuters.

With almost 20% of the world's proven reserves and production costs of just $4 a barrel, Aramco believes it can undercut competitors and carry on making money even when lower oil prices make it unprofitable for rivals, the sources said.

Riyadh now plans to follow through on its apparent threat in March during an oil price war with Russia to raise its capacity to 13 million barrels a day (bpd) from 12 million bpd, officials and sources have said.

Aramco's approach is in stark contrast to Western rivals such as BP (L: ) and Shell (L: ) which plan to curb spending on oil production so they can invest in renewable and green energy as they prepare for a low-carbon world.

With a renewed focus on oil, the state-run oil giant is also revising ambitious downstream expansion plans and now aims to grab assets in established projects in key markets such as India and China, rather than building expensive mega plants from scratch, the sources said.

""We expect oil demand growth to continue in the long term, driven by rising populations and economic growth. Fuels and petrochemicals will support demand growth ... speculation about an imminent peak in oil demand is simply not consistent with the realities of oil consumption,"" Aramco said in a statement to Reuters.

'TAKE THE MONEY'

The possibility that demand for crude has peaked makes it more pressing for the world's top oil exporter to exploit its reserves while it can to generate cash to fund Saudi Arabia's economic reforms, sources familiar with Saudi policymaking say.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is trying to develop new industries to reduce the kingdom's dependency on oil under his ambitious Vision 2030 plan to diversify the economy.

But for the plan to succeed, Prince Mohammed needs lots of cash - and Aramco's oil sales are his main source of revenue.

""The crown prince said he will diversify but he didn't say he will kill the oil industry. As long as it can make more money why not? Take the money and invest it somewhere else,"" one of the sources told Reuters.

""Let's agree that given the global economic situation, full diversification won't happen by 2030,"" he said. ""To completely wean a giant economy like Saudi off oil, it will require at least 50 years more. So as long as oil is with us, make more money out of it if you can.""

Aramco is also focused on how to pump more, cleaner fuel while cutting greenhouse gas emissions to give it a better chance to compete as governments tighten carbon regulations, analysts and sources briefed on the company's plans said.

Aramco's oil production already has a so-called carbon intensity of 10.1 kg of carbon dioxide (CO2) for each barrel produced (CO2e/boe) - the lowest among its rivals - and it wants to push that down even further by the end of this year.

""Our priorities are to sustain our low carbon intensity and low cost of production, while delivering the energy supplies the world needs,"" Aramco told Reuters.

""(Aramco) is researching ways to reduce emissions through technology, such as making engines more efficient, better fuel formulations, carbon capture and sequestration, and turning CO2 and hydrocarbons into useful products,"" the company said.

Aramco will continue to develop its gas resources due to both rising domestic needs and the Kingdom's ambitions to become a gas exporter, the sources said.

LOWEST COST

Aramco's plan to boost its capacity to 13 million barrels a day is central to its strategy as it wants to be ready to grab a bigger market share when demand recovers, sources briefed on Saudi Arabia's oil thinking said.

Saudi Arabia, also needs to be ready for the uncertainty in oil prices expected post COVID-19 to ensure it can keep spending plans and economic reforms largely unaffected with crude priced at $40 a barrel, or $60, sources and analysts said.

The thinking within Saudi Arabia is that as oil prices are expected to stay depressed - and may hover around $50-$60 for several years - shutdowns in places such as the United States, where shale oil is costly to produce, should support prices.

""Saudi Arabia, being the lowest cost producer, could see an increase in volumes and market share in the years to come even if global oil demand and prices do not recover as a lack of investment naturally leads to production declines elsewhere,"" said Krisjanis Krustins, a director in the Middle East and Africa team at Fitch Ratings.

The passing of peak oil demand may also lead to a new price war and an end to efforts by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting countries (OPEC) and its allies to curb supply - so Riyadh wants to be armed and ready for battle, sources said.

All oil producers will face a similar need to monetise their reserves and energy assets before they lose value. Besides Saudi Arabia, the economies of OPEC members such as Russia, Venezuela, Iraq and Iran all depend heavily on oil and gas.

""There is always going to be space for oil and the lowest carbon emitter will win,"" said Amrita Sen, co-founder of the think-tank, Energy Aspects. ""OPEC market power will return, especially for those who can produce oil in the cleanest way possible, and Saudi Aramco fits that bill.""

DOWNSTREAM REVIEW

Another central part of Aramco's strategy is a review by the corporate development organisation the company set up in August of its costly acquisition plans for downstream assets.

Aramco has made big bets on petrochemicals and oil refining as a way to mitigate against a slowdown in oil demand growth.

But in an industry that may be on the cusp of a long-term decline, Aramco is now looking to buy assets investors want to offload, rather than building them from scratch, sources said.

For example, Aramco has deferred plans to build a $10 billion refining and petrochemicals complex with Chinese defence conglomerate Norinco (SZ: ) in China, the sources told Reuters, confirming earlier reports.

The Saudi company is, however, interested in investing in another project in China, where it would buy a stake in the Zhejiang refinery and petrochemicals complex south of Shanghai and get its hands on an oil storage facility, the sources said.

Officials at Zhejiang Petroleum & Chemical Co Ltd could not immediately be reached for comment.

Aramco is also keen to invest in India and is in talks with Reliance Industries (NS: ) to buy a 20% stake in its oil-to-chemical business although negotiations have been dragging the sale price.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/sole-survivor-saudi-arabia-doubles-down-on-oil-to-outlast-rivals-2227701,0.079,0.817,0.104,0.9856

LONDON (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest commodities and energy players on Wednesday launched an initiative to cut and track emissions from the ships they charter as efforts intensify to reduce the maritime industry's carbon footprint.

About 90% of world trade is transported by sea, and the UN shipping agency - the International Maritime Organization (IMO) - aims to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 2008 levels by 2050.

Carbon emissions from shipping rose in the six-year period to 2018 and accounted for 2.89% of the world’s CO2, the latest IMO-commissioned study showed, mounting pressure on the industry to bring levels down.

Under the Sea Cargo Charter, 17 companies, including agrigroups Cargill, ADM and Bunge, oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Total and mining group Anglo American (LON: ) will publicly disclose annually whether their overall ship chartering activities are aligned with IMO 2050 goals.

""People buying voyage freight will start asking the question what emissions were actually tagged to this voyage and that is a question that was really not asked before,"" Jan Dieleman, president of Cargill's ocean transportation division, told Reuters.

""By creating the transparency, it becomes a topic in chartering decisions.""

Peter Lye, global head of shipping with Anglo American, said charterers signed up will be able to analyse the emissions associated with ocean freight in a methodical way.

Grahaeme Henderson, global head of Shell Shipping & Maritime, added: ""Collaboration such as this, from across the sector, is vital to scale-up customer demand for low- or zero-emissions shipping.""

The initiative follows a parallel project, known as the Poseidon Principles, launched in 2019, where 18 of the world's biggest industry lenders agreed to link the provision of shipping finance to cuts in CO2.

The other companies involved in the latest initiative, launched by the non-profit Global Maritime Forum, are COFCO International, , Equinor, Gunvor Group, Klaveness Combination Carriers, Louis Dreyfus Company, Norden, Occidental (NYSE: ), Torvald Klaveness, Trafigura and Ørsted.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/top-global-traders-push-to-cut-shipping-emissions-2227798,0.028,0.931,0.041,0.3818

(Bloomberg) -- Poland’s antitrust watchdog slapped a $7.6 billion fine on Gazprom PJSC (OTC: ) over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, opening a new front in the bitter political battle over the project. Wednesday’s surprise move raises a whole set of legal questions about the plan, which is teetering on the brink.

What was the fine for?

The antitrust authority said Gazprom (MCX: ) and its partners, which were ordered to pay about $61.3 million, failed to get its approval for a joint venture to finance the pipeline. Completing the project makes European gas customers more dependent on a single supplier, Gazprom, and may increase gas prices for Polish customers, the authority said. It also ordered the companies to terminate their financing agreements for the pipeline.

What happens next?

The Polish authority gave Gazprom and its partners 30 days days to “restore” competition or appeal the decision. While Gazprom owns the Baltic Sea pipeline project, half of its 9.5 billion-euro ($11.2 billion) cost is being financed by Engie SA, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, Germany’s Uniper SE (OTC: ), Wintershall AG and Austria’s OMV AG.

Gazprom already said it will appeal and any ruling will most likely take at least five years, based on the current length of antitrust cases. Courts could decide to fast-track the procedure, if lawyers manage to convince them of the urgency of the case.

The dispute could move from the local tribunal in charge of competition matters all the way up to the Supreme Court, where it could get stuck for at least three years. A 2006 decision by the competition watchdog on an interchange-fee cartel is still being processed by Polish courts.

When will Gazprom have to pay up?

The fine will only have to be paid once the court of appeals issues a binding verdict. If Gazprom doesn’t pay, judges could order the seizure of assets.

Is there a risk of political interference?

Maybe. A series of controversial judicial reforms in Poland since 2015 has led to increased political influence over courts, putting the nation on the collision path with the European Commission and triggering a series of lawsuits at the EU’s courts that could threaten the nation’s access to the bloc’s funds. Some European courts have refused to hand suspects to Poland under European arrest warrant procedures amid concerns that their trial would not be fair.

While a given court and its rulings may not be politicized, the problem of the Polish judiciary has become systemic and politicians have excessive influence over courts, says the association of Polish judges Iustitia. This, in turn, strips them of confidence in the impartiality and independence of their rulings.

Does the fine and appeal put Nord Stream 2 on hold?

No. The Polish decision can’t block the entire pipeline project and its effects might remain purely of a financial nature for Gazprom, but it creates a further hurdle. According to analysts, Poland has no jurisdiction to halt the construction of the gas pipeline, which is almost complete, because the gas link doesn’t cross the nation’s territorial waters or its exclusive economic zone.

How unusual is the penalty?

Very. The Polish fine far-exceeds EU monopoly-abuse penalties for big tech firms like Google (NASDAQ: ) and is well above the fines that the EU or other national authorities have handed down for breaches of merger rules. The EU’s antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager pointedly told reporters this week that none of her fines since 2014 have hit the maximum level of 10% of a company’s yearly revenue. Altice NV was fined 124.5 million euros two years ago for moving forward on a takeover before it got EU permission.

Could it all end up in the EU courts?

Chances are slim. Poland’s antitrust office became involved in this case after Gazprom and its partners asked it and other EU regulators to approve the creation of Nord Stream 2. After Poland questioned the joint venture in 2016, the companies revoked the request and proceeded to get loan financing. The Polish regulator continued investigating, saying the move was an attempt to circumvent competition law. Because the decision is based on national law and issued solely by the Polish watchdog, without the involvement of the European Commission, the local courts will have the final say in the case.

A direct challenge against Poland’s decision at the EU’s courts in Luxembourg won’t be possible for the same reasons. But, since Poland is an EU member and is supposed to apply antitrust rules in line with the bloc’s laws, there is a slight possibility that a question about the scope of EU law comes up in the course of the Polish appeals.

If a Polish court decided it was unable to give an answer, it could refer a number of questions to the EU Court of Justice. Such questions would not go into the substance of the dispute and would be focused only on questions of law. The wrangling would also delay any final decision by another two years or so.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/why-gazproms-76-billion-nord-stream-2-fine-is-just-the-start-2229557,0.052,0.883,0.065,0.8492

3 high-dividend value FTSE 100 shares I’d buy {{0|now}}

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LCO -0.17% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Overall, the has seen a sizeable decline this year; however, this also provides the opportunity to purchase businesses at a greater value than previously. Here are three value shares with high dividend yields that I’d buy now.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) has had a tough time this year with the sharp drop in demand for oil, as most continue to work remotely and international travel is still limited. The wholesale price of oil, measured as , reduced from $65 per barrel in January to just above $40 dollars where it has stabilised at in recent months. As such, Shell’s margins and ability to generate cash have been affected.

In response, the FTSE 100 giant suspended its share buyback programme and cut its quarterly dividend for the first time since World War II, from 47 cents to 16 cents per share. Inevitably the share price has dropped, reducing from around 2,200p a share in January to 952p today, but now yields a bargain price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 6 with an impressive dividend yield of 5%.

Shell has embarked on a number of initiatives to adapt to lower oil prices long term, some of these being the selling of underperforming assets, the reduction of operational cost and diversification into renewable energy production, all aiming towards Shell’s goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050.

At the current share price, I think Royal Dutch Shell presents excellent value for a business heading in the right direction.

Legal and General (LSE: LGEN) was one of a handful of FTSE 100 businesses that kept its dividend despite pressure on businesses to reduce them by the Bank of England earlier this year. This was justified by a strong balance sheet with a dividend covered twice by earnings. At the current price of 199p, the P/E ratio is just over 6 and the dividend yield is an unrivalled 8.7%.

Moving forward the company has proven robust. Its 2020 first half results revealed a marginal loss in operating profit of -2%; however, three out of its five operations delivered growth. This demonstrates its financial robustness at a time when other businesses have experienced steep losses.

Overall Legal and General has proved to be a resilient and well managed business that, at the current share price, presents great value.

GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) is another FTSE 100 company that has proved to have a resilient business model this year, even despite significant outlay as it contributes towards a vaccine for Covid-19. The shares currently trade at 1,430p each, with a P/E ratio of 11.7 and a dividend of 5.5%. The dividend is also secure, covered by one and a half times earnings and its recent second quarter results showed that profit more than doubled from the same time last year.

Currently, GSK is coming to the end of a major restructure which I think will provide for a more solid business in terms of sales and revenue growth long term.

Overall, Royal Dutch Shell, Legal and General and GlaxoSmithKline have shown their ability to weather the current economic downturn as well as showing promising growth long term. Diversified by operating in separate markets, coupled with their current price and dividend yield, I think their value is too great to miss.

With the sitting at around 6,000 points, you may be wondering why on earth now would be a good time to buy UK shares. After all, the index is in the same position it was in 2016, and has failed to bounce back as strongly as its US counterpart, the .

On top of this, the UK economy is in tatters as a result of the impact of Covid-19, which is showing no sign of letting up in the near future.

What’s more, shares in many major UK companies look downright unappealing at present. I’m thinking of well-established businesses such as Rolls-Royce (LON: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), and HSBC, each of which have taken huge hits in the aftermath of the sell-off.

The appeal of UK shares Despite all this, I’m confident that buying high-quality UK shares today is a wise move. Moreover, if you’re prepared to be in it for the long term, I reckon it could even boost your chances of making a million after the stock market crash of 2020.

But how? Well, many UK shares are trading on vastly reduced valuations at the moment, which is particularly appealing to value investors. Ultimately, with a great deal of stocks looking under-priced, now could be an ideal time to buy in ahead of a break out at some point in the future.

That said, it’s entirely possible that UK shares could continue to underperform in the short term. Additionally, I wouldn’t even rule out a second major sell-off. Either way, I wouldn’t be too concerned. History demonstrates that those who are brave enough to hold onto their shares after market corrections often go on to make a tidy return in the long run.

In fact, if UK shares do take another tumble, I’d use it as an opportunity to hoover up even more stocks at discounted prices.

Making a million after the stock market crash Ultimately, buying cheap shares in high-quality companies and holding them for the long term is a tried and tested method for building vast amounts of wealth. For instance, take a look at legendary investor Warren Buffett, who has made millions from buying undervalued stocks. Interestingly, Buffett says that if you don’t feel comfortable holding a company for 10 years, you shouldn’t even own it for 10 minutes!

When it comes to building your own six-figure portfolio, I reckon you could do far worse than follow some of Buffett’s key principles. Additionally, it doesn’t take eye-watering yearly returns to grow a vast sum over time. Hypothetically, let’s assume you invest £500 a month for the next 35 years in a mixture of diversified shares. Provided you achieved an average annual return of 8% (identical to the average yearly return of the FTSE 100 index) you’d have an investment pot worth £1,078,202!

With that in mind, I’d press on with buying cheap UK shares regardless of current market conditions. All things considered, keeping a calm temperament during temporary market downswings is key to implementing a solid long-term investment strategy and realizing a tidy return.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's anti-monopoly watchdog said on Wednesday it had fined Russia's Gazprom (MM: ) more than 29 billion zlotys ($7.6 billion) for building the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline without its approval.

The UOKiK watchdog also said it had imposed a 234 million zloty fine on five other firms involved in financing $11 billion project set to double Russia's gas export capacity via the Baltic Sea.

Nord Stream 2 is led by Gazprom, with half of the funding provided by Germany's Uniper (DE: ) and BASF's (DE: ) Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch company Shell (L: ), Austria's OMV (VI: ) and Engie (PA: ).

Poland sees Nord Stream 2 as a threat to Europe's energy security as it will increase reliance on Russian energy.

The United States has also imposed sanctions on companies laying pipes for the project.

UOKiK has been examining the project for years. In August it fined Gazprom 213 million zlotys over a lack of cooperation regarding the project.

""The launch of NS2 will threaten the continuity of supplies to Poland. An increase in the price of the product is also highly likely, with the said increase being borne by Polish consumers,"" said Tomasz Chrostny, president of UOKiK.

""Completion of this investment project increases economic dependence on Russian gas - not only in the case of Poland, but also of other European states,"" Chrostny said.

Ten days ago, I wrote an article about the Rolls-Royce (LSE:LON: ) rights issue. You can read that here. I discussed how the Rolls-Royce share price could continue to be under pressure due to the implications of it needing to raise billions of pounds.

It showed that the firm needs liquidity fast, in a sector which is underperforming. The new shares were being offered to existing investors at 32p, which was a steep discount from the price of around 104p when the news broke. This was seen as a low price to encourage a large take-up, ensuring the firm could raise the needed funds.

A week can be a long time in the markets, and last week was a golden example. The Rolls-Royce share price went on an incredible rally, to finish the week at 223p. This almost doubled the price at which it started Monday. So is it now worth jumping on the bandwagon and buying for my ISA?

A share-price reversal There were several reasons why the Rolls-Royce share price bounced back strongly last week. Firstly, investors had the weekend to digest the rights issue news. Although I maintain this to be a negative scenario, many investors clearly saw it as a positive. You could argue that Rolls-Royce is successfully raising new capital, helping it to survive a difficult period.

The share price also benefited from the news that Heathrow is a trial airport for a new Covid-19 ‘passport’. It’s essentially an app that holds a certified Covid-19 test status on it, allowing passengers to travel without quarantine restrictions. It might not be the finished product, but it at least could make flying more accessible. Due to the fact that Rolls-Royce has a large exposure to the aviation industry, this was an indirect boost for the firm.

An article in the Financial Times also reported that the UK government is considering a £2bn investment into mini-nuclear reactors. Rolls-Royce has experience in building similar power plants. Given that the firm already has close ties with the government, it’s logical to think some of this work could be contracted out to the firm. This kind of project could be very profitable, hence the Rolls-Royce share price rallying last week.

Time to buy in? Despite the posivitty regarding the above points, I’d still stay away from investing right now. The outlook for the firm remains negative in the short term, in my opinion. Even with the huge rally, the Rolls-Royce share price is still down 68% year-to-date.

More speculative investors may disagree and feel it’s worth an investment for the long term. If you do feel this way, make sure to buy the stock within an ISA. Should the share price eventually recover its losses, then the ISA wrapper will ensure that you keep all of the profit. Without it, you could be facing a hefty capital gains tax bill.

From my point of view, I’d be looking elsewhere for better value stocks. For example, I think the oil sector is due a turnaround, so would look to buy stocks like BP (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ).

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top oil companies are yet to be aligned with U.N.-backed targets to combat climate change even after outlining ambitious plans to slash carbon emissions and pivot to renewable energy, a report backed by a group of major investors said.

The study by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI), which unites investors with $22 trillion in holdings, comes as shares of European energy companies including BP (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) have struggled amid concerns over their ability to successfully shift away from oil and gas.

TPI's analysis of 59 major oil, gas and coal companies said that seven European firms - Glencore (L: ), Anglo American (L: ), Shell, Repsol (MC: ), Total (PA: ), Eni (MI: ) and Equinor (OL: ) - have set out plans to align with long-term pledges made by some governments to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

But those targets equate to global temperatures rising by 3.2 degrees and are ""widely regarded as insufficient to avert dangerous climate change,"" the report, published on Wednesday, said.

No company was set to meet the United Nations-backed Paris Agreement's long-term goal of limiting global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by reducing carbon emissions to net zero, it said.

""We're very happy that some oil and gas companies are seeing these fundamental changes and trying to respond,"" said Bill Hartnett, stewardship director of ESG Investment at Aberdeen Standard Investments, a TPI member.

""Some (companies) might have made bigger statements so far than the others and the important thing is the direction of travel. But none of them are making net zero yet,"" Hartnett told Reuters.

BP, whose CEO Bernard Looney plans to grow the company's renewables business twenty-fold by the end of the decade, is the least aligned among the European companies, not even meeting the government pledges level, according to the report.

In May, BP said that it disagreed with TPI's methodology which focuses on the carbon intensity of fuels.

Fossil fuels are the main cause for the release of heat-capturing greenhouse gas emissions.

(Oil majors' climate alignment with Paris - TPI: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/xklvyqryyvg/Pasted%20image%201601898987404.png)

Investors such as Aberdeen are regularly talking to companies about their Paris Agreement alignment on issues including emissions from fuels sold, known as Scope 3 emissions, and their memberships in energy associations around the world, Hartnett said.

""Engagement is ongoing and there is pretty good momentum on getting towards Paris alignment.""

A Shell spokeswoman said the company continues ""to engage with TPI over their methodology"" to show it is how it is aligned with ""society's move towards"" the Paris goals.

Anglo American said in a statement: ""achieving these targets is not all within our control, so we are working with governments, industry peers and civil society... to support the development of effective and efficient policies to combat climate change.""

Repsol said: ""We will continue to engage with TPI to demonstrate our progress in this respect.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/despite-shift-energy-giants-fall-short-of-un-climate-goals-study-2227709,0.035,0.851,0.113,0.9931

LONDON (Reuters) - Premier Oil (LON: )'s takeover by private equity-backed Chrysaor marks the end of an 86-year oil wildcatter and could herald wider consolidation provided there are willing buyers in a sector whose outlook is highly uncertain.

Leading oil and gas companies, including BP (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), want to sell large parts of their portfolios to prepare for a shift towards renewable energy.

The impact of COVID-19 has also hit the hydrocarbon industry particularly hard because of its impact on demand and oil and gas prices.

Faced with ballooning debt, smaller exploration and production (E&P) companies, such as Africa-focused Tullow Oil (LON: ) and North Sea producer Ithaca Energy, also want to sell assets or partner with an investor.

But the pool of buyers is small.

A handful of private equity firms, such as Chrysaor, backed by Harbour Energy, and HitecVision, as well as a small number of listed companies, such as Serica Energy, are the most likely purchasers, analysts and multiple industry sources said.

Private equity firms see opportunities to make money by cutting costs, betting on higher oil prices in the coming years as investments shrink leading to lower output.

They put money into oil and gas fields to extend their lives, when larger companies might be reluctant to spend more on assets no longer big enough to make a difference in a major portfolio.

""The sector in general is ripe for consolidation,"" Harbour CEO Linda Cook told a conference call. She is expected to become CEO of the merged Chrysaor-Premier entity.

The reverse takeover announced on Tuesday needs shareholder backing and regulatory approval.

BLUEPRINT

Premier's takeover follows months of wrangling with its creditors, who tried to ease a $2.7 billion debt burden by finding new cornerstone investors after the COVID-19 pandemic helped to drive down oil prices to 30-year lows, sources involved in the talks told Reuters.

Those efforts drew no interest, the sources said on condition of anonymity.

Chrysaor swiftly stepped in in July with an offer to creditors to buy Premier as part of a debt settlement. CEO Tony Durrant reluctantly accepted it after pressure mounted.

With the completion of the deal later this year, Chrysaor will publicly list and become the largest North Sea producer.

Premier's debt-holders and shareholders were short-changed but avoided greater losses that would have followed had Premier fallen into bankruptcy.

The spotlight now turns to some of Premier's London-listed rivals that face similar difficulties.

""This deal is a good example of the consolidation that needs to happen to the oil & gas sector, we need bigger companies with bigger asset bases and stronger balance sheets,"" said Martin Copeland, managing director at RBC, which advised Premier in the deal.

""There are other public oil and gas explorers with heavy debt loads …this could be a blueprint for similar deals,"" Copeland added.

Tullow Oil and North Sea producer Enquest, both seen as ground-breaking firms during the oil price boom a decade ago, face shareholder pressure to reduce debt and sell assets after their share value has collapsed along with oil prices.

Both their share prices rose sharply on Tuesday, with Tullow gaining around 18% and EnQuest up 10%.

Tullow, in turmoil after technical issues at its flagship field in Ghana and disappointing exploration results in Guyana, is struggling with $3 billion in debt and a market capitalisation of $280 million (215.6 million pounds).

EnQuest, with net debt of around $1.35 billion in September and a market capitalisation of $298 million, has agreed with its lenders on a pre-emptive waiver of its liquidity test for the rest of 2020.

Both EnQuest and Tullow declined to comment.

""The UK sector is ripe for consolidation. The last time the industry truly underwent a period of mega-consolidation was in the late 1990s,"" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Greig Aitken.

By Joe Brock

(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.

From Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.

But there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. It's a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.

""I really see a lot of people struggling,"" Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. ""They don't see a light at the end of the tunnel.""

The reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.

Already since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as ""virgin"" material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.

Since COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic – the most commonly recycled plastic item – have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).

The pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the world's traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.

Plastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.

The manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.

But the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.

The oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.

This is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.

""Over the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,"" ExxonMobil (NYSE: ) spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.

Most companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.

Reuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally – BASF, Chevron (NYSE: ), , Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell (LON: ) and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.

Most said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.

In total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. That's a fraction of their sales.

Plans to invest so heavily in new plastic are ""quite a concerning move,"" said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.

""Countries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,"" she said. ""We are literally drowning in plastics.""

Since the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.

Greg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.

""The pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,"" he said.

The oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.

Some said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the world's consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.

""Higher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,"" said a spokesman at BASF SE (DE: ) of Germany, the world's biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.

The new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.

MAKE PLASTIC

Richard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned ""sari-sari"" or ""sundries"" store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.

Merchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.

""Many years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,"" said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.

Today, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.

Already, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. That's nearly 60 billion a year.

Consumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for ""upcycling.""

But sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.

So are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.

In March, China used 116 million of them – 12 times more than in February, official data show.

Total production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire year's worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.

Even as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.

Exxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.

And oil's share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP (LON: ) Plc said in its annual market report in September.

Oil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.

The U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BP's chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 – around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.

USE PLASTIC

This year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the world's most populous country.

An additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.

In the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.

Those investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap released by the shale revolution.

The industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.

""Single-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,"" Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industry's lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.

""Hospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.""

In March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.

Researchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and .

The industry's letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.

The ACC's managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.

""The challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldn't accomplish much,"" Christman said.

Plastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.

Plastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.

RECYCLE?

Plastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.

Demand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.

At the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.

""There are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,"" she said. ""We need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.""

In the United States, QRS's Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.

And the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.

The Coca-Cola (NYSE: ) Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.

Coca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo (NASDAQ: ) have been the world's top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.

These companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.

""We often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,"" a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.

Asked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.

At current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.

TOSS

Even if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.

Cumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes – the weight of 3 million blue whales.

In response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.

One venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.

That's less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.

""We do realise change won't happen overnight,"" said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. ""What is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.""

In the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.

""The combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammy"" for plastic recycling, said Circulate's CEO, Rob Kaplan.

Investing.com -- Donald Trump returns to the White House, talk on fiscal stimulus progresses, and central bankers line up to promise more. Stocks are drifting lower but oil is well supported ahead of weekly stockpile data. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, October 6th.

1. Trump back at the White House

U.S. President Donald Trump left hospital to return to the White House late on Monday, less than a week after being diagnosed with the Covid-19 virus.

In a brief video clip Trump urged his fellow Americans not to be afraid of the virus and not to let it “dominate” their lives, pointing to the quality of U.S. healthcare and vaccines that he said would be “arriving momentarily”.

Trump is under pressure to return to the campaign trail (and the fund-raising trail) as soon as possible, given that he trails Democratic nominee Joe Biden nationally by as much as 14 points.

Some 210,000 Americans have died from the virus so far, with a clear – if still relatively gentle – upward trend in hospitalizations over the last two weeks as the onset of autumn works in the virus’ favor.

2. Stimulus talks progress; Powell, Lagarde speeches due

Talks on a fresh round of fiscal support for the U.S. economy appear to be making progress toward completion.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke by telephone for an hour on Monday in an effort to narrow their remaining differences. The talks are set to continue on Tuesday, according to various reports.

Hints of fresh stimulus to support the recovery also came from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who told The Wall Street Journal that the economy is looking a little shakier, and stressed that the ECB still had room to cut its interest rates further below zero.

Lagarde is due to speak at a conference later, along with her chief economist Philip Lane. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will also address the same conference, while there are addresses elsewhere from Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and the Dallas Fed’s Robert Kaplan.

3. Stocks set to drift lower

U.S. stock markets are set to open moderately lower after making strong gains on Monday in expectation of a fiscal stimulus package.

By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), were down 29 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.3% and Nasdaq futures were down 0.5%. The Nasdaq had made much the biggest gains of all three major indexes on Monday.

Stocks in focus later may include Sonos (NASDAQ: ), after reports that Apple (NASDAQ: ) is dropping the wireless speaker maker’s products from its stores. That comes against a backdrop of heightened antitrust scrutiny of the way Apple and other major internet platform companies increasingly act as gatekeepers to the real economy for all other companies.

A light earnings schedule is headed by Levi Strauss (NYSE: ).

4. Johnson peps renewable stocks

European renewable energy stocks hit fresh highs after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced extra funding to guarantee the rollout of offshore wind power in the U.K.

The U.K. is Europe’s largest offshore wind market, and now intends to have 40 Gigawatts of capacity installed offshore by 2030 – enough, theoretically, to power every home in the country.

Johnson’s speech included pledges of more money to help U.K. ports and infrastructure adjust to the Energy Transition. However, it offered nothing to grid operator National Grid (LON: ), whose job of managing power transmission will be made more difficult by accommodating so much variable generation capacity.

Wind farm operators Orsted (OTC: ) and Encavis stock hit a new all-time high, as did turbine maker Vestas. National Grid stock fell 1.2%.

5. Oil up ahead of API data, STEO

The American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly assessment of U.S. oil inventories at 4:30 PM ET (2030 GMT). Last week’s numbers showed unexpectedly strong demand with a net draw of 831,000 barrels.

That news will come four hours after the U.S. government releases its regular Short-Term Energy Outlook.

Crude futures have risen modestly overnight on optimism about the outlook for U.S. stimulus: U.S. futures were up 1.1% at $39.62 a barrel, while futures were up 1.1% at $41.72 a barrel.

The pressure on the oil and gas industry remains intense, however. Elsewhere, a top Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) executive said the company intends to scale down to having fewer than 10 refineries worldwide. The comments come against a backdrop of low refining margins and an uncertain demand outlook for products such as jet fuel.",https://uk.investing.com//news/economy/trumps-back-stimulus-talk-and-stocks-drift-lower-whats-up-in-markets-2227109,0.048,0.855,0.097,0.9924

3 ways I think Donald Trump could indirectly influence the FTSE 100 price in October

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BATS -2.54% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

The world is a much more interconnected place than it was a decade ago. The same applies to stock markets. Events around the world can impact the market of a completely different country. For example, when unrest in Hong Kong was turning violent last year, the fell. With this in mind, UK investors need to keep an eye out for potential influences on the FTSE 100 price caused by external factors. US President Donald Trump is one such factor that could have an influence this month on the FTSE 100 price.

How could Trump affect the Footsie? First up is the recent news that Trump has tested positive for Covid-19, and is currently in hospital. When the news broke late last week, US equities fell. The FTSE 100 also fell. Why? Well, one of the most important men globally potentially being seriously ill has huge ramifications. Should he be unable to overcome the virus then a lot of issues need to be sorted quickly. After all, he’s the head of the largest economy in the world.

This impacts the companies listed on the FTSE 100. Many trade in the US, and so would be impacted by any developments. The bottom line is that how Trump copes with the virus will impact the FTSE 100.

The next way Donald Trump could impact the FTSE 100 is via the run-up to the election. It may be taking place in early November, but key election debates and polls will shift the market throughout this month. As I’ve written about before, a Trump victory could be taken as a positive for stock markets. A Democrat victory could be taken as the opposite — although nothing is certain.

Again, the FTSE 100 will likely mirror the moves seen in the US stock markets as the campaigns progress this month. It’s therefore a good idea to keep an eye on the polls in the coming weeks.

Finally, Donald Trump could shift the FTSE 100 price via sentiment towards Brexit and a UK-US trade deal. The key EU-UK summit on 15-16 October is coming up, where some think a deal could be struck. Trump is a fan of Brexit, and may publicly comment on negotiations again to try and sway things. He may also dangle the carrot of good terms of a future UK-US trade deal. This could not only help his popularity at home during the election campaign, but also help in cementing positive UK relations if he wins the election.

How to position your portfolio? Trump’s potential impact via Covid-19 is largely a negative, although some of the risk is already priced in. If he wins the election, and comments on Brexit, then it’s likely positive for stocks. So I’d be looking to stay invested in stocks that could benefit, and would even buy particular stocks if the firm has a large exposure to the US. For example, British American Tobacco (LON: ) is a business that could benefit. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) is another case and has a dual listing in the UK and US.

Human nature means that we all want to get a good deal when we buy something. This can be negotiating over buying a car or a house, or even snapping up sale bargains. This carries over into investing in the stock market. For many, buying a UK stock when it’s at all-time highs isn’t as appealing as buying a cheap UK stock. Buying when the share price is heavily in the red can make you feel that you’ve got a good deal.

This view can be correct and work out well long term, but investors need to be very careful. Sometimes the stock is cheap for a reason as the business is struggling, rather than falling (perhaps unfairly) along with its peers during a market crash. Over the past 12 months, several stocks are down over 50%. So are they cheap buys, or are their low prices a warning sign?

Aviation Two stocks that fall into this category are linked to the airline sector. These are Rolls-Royce (LON: ) and International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON: ) (IAG). Rolls-Royce supplies engines and works on service and maintenance. IAG owns British Airways and Aer Lingus, along with other brands. Between the two firms, the share prices are down between 70% and 84%. This is in large part due to the pandemic, with associated lockdowns and a reluctance by many to travel.

Does the slump make these UK stocks cheap? This is a really tough one to answer at the moment. Rolls-Royce is struggling to operate, made evident by the news late last week about a new rights issue and bond issue, aiming to raise £5bn. IAG is also looking to raise fresh capital. In my opinion, this sector is too risky to invest in at the moment. A small speculative investment could be warranted, but I wouldn’t invest more than you’re happy to lose.

Oil The other major industry that has massively underperformed over the past year is oil. Shares in BP (LON: ) are down 56%, with Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) down 59%. Both firms have suffered indirectly from the pandemic. For example, demand for jet fuel has fallen off a cliff, which impacts revenues. Demand for petrol and diesel also slumped during Q2, although this has almost returned to normal. Pressure on the oil price has also eaten into margins. This makes the two stocks look cheap.

I’m more optimistic on the two oil majors recovering in the long term. The firms are part of a small club that dominates the industry, so demand will always be shared out between them. Demand for refined products should continue to head back towards normal, as governments cannot afford to have prolonged national lockdowns as earlier this year. Further, if dividends are reinstated back to the level seen before the pandemic, this should attract a wave of income investors. So I think these shares do look cheap but potentially valuable too.

Cheap UK stocks worth buying One of the signs of a good investor is deciding when not to buy a stock. Fear of missing out is simply not a valid investing strategy. So do your homework and see whether a stock is a cheap buy, or something to steer clear of!

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 rose on Monday, lifted by oil stocks as crude prices jumped after doctors treating U.S. President Donald Trump for COVID-19 hinted that he was doing well, while Cineworld fell sharply after it said it was considering temporarily closing all U.S. and UK screens.

By Shadia Nasralla

LONDON (Reuters) - Private equity-backed Chrysaor has agreed a reverse takeover of Premier Oil (L: ), the firms said on Tuesday, creating the British North Sea's largest oil and gas producer at a time the sector is facing a sharp decline in demand.

The deal, which will see Premier's creditors paid $1.23 billion in cash, will fold one of the world's oldest independent producers into a private equity-backed group in which Premier shareholders will receive an expected 5.45% stake.

Chrysaor's largest shareholder, Harbour Energy, is expected to own just over 39% of the merged company, which will stay listed on the London Stock Exchange.

The combined group, which will have a new name, will be run by Harbour Chief Executive Linda Cook, while Chrysaor CEO Phil Kirk will be head of its European business. Current Premier CEO Tony Durrant will not have a role.

Premier Oil shares were up about 5% at 15.93 pence by 1405 GMT, but are still down more than 84% in the year to date. Benchmark Brent crude oil ( ) prices have fallen as low as $16 a barrel this year as the coronavirus sapped global demand.

Premier, which traces its history back to the 1930s, underwent debt restructuring in 2017 after the last oil price collapse. It currently has net debt of $1.9 billion, and before the announcement had a market capitalisation of $182 million.

The deal still needs approval by regulators and Premier's creditors and shareholders. ""The Board intends to recommend unanimously this transaction to shareholders,"" Premier chairman Roy Franklin said.

Creditors, who the companies' spokesmen said will get between 70 and 80 cents on each dollar owed, will also receive shares in the new group, though overall, Premier stakeholders will hold not more than 23%.

Chrysaor, backed by private equity firms Harbour and EIG, has become a major North Sea producer by buying up British fields from Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and ConocoPhillips (N: ), spending about $5.7 billion since 2017.

Kirk said while the group had not yet paid out its owners any ""meaningful"" amount, the plan was to start paying dividends with the merged group.

""Our investors of course would be happy to have a dividend some day,"" future CEO Cook told a conference call.

""But I think they're also more interested in making sure we have a sustainable, vibrant portfolio with a lot of... growth so that any dividend that we decide to pay in the future is going to be sustainable.""

Chrysaor produces just under 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). Combined with Premier's output of around 70,000 boe/d, it would become be the biggest oil and gas producer in the British North Sea, topping BP (L: ) and Shell.

(GRAPHIC - British North Sea producers: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/xegvbjxjqvq/UK%20North%20Sea%20producers.png)

Premier also brings to the table a 25% stake in Mexico's Zama shallow water offshore project, plus production in east Asia.

It will withdraw from a planned purchase of some BP fields, Premier's Durrant said. The new firm will also be able to use tax allowances from past losses Premier has accrued.

""We estimate (Premier) shareholders gain a low premium merger with upside from materially reduced balance sheet risk and tax synergies,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note.

A prospectus on the proposed reverse takeover is expected towards the end of the year, Kirk and Durrant told Reuters.

Chrysaor has hired banks BMO, Barclays (LON: ), Premier RBC and Jefferies to work on the deal, while Premier's biggest creditor ARCM has been working with Moelis, and other creditors with Lazard.

(Bloomberg) -- Premier Oil Plc (LON: ) and Chrysaor Holdings Ltd. agreed on a merger, bringing together two of the largest U.K. North Sea oil and gas producers.

The deal will be a relief to London-based Premier, which has spent most of the year laboring to restructure its debt, during which time its shares have tumbled 85%. The deal includes an agreement on the reorganization of Premier’s existing debt and cross-currency swaps.

“The transaction will create the largest independent oil and gas company listed on the London Stock Exchange with combined production of over 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent day,” Premier said Tuesday in a statement. The combined group will have “significant international growth opportunities.”

Chrysaor shareholders will get at least 77% of the combined company. Premier’s stakeholders will get the rest, with the exact amount depending on the conversion of some of its debt into equity.

Premier’s $2.7 billion of total gross debt and certain hedging liabilities will be repaid and cancelled on completion, according to the statement. A cash payment of $1.23 billion will be made to Premier’s creditors, who will also receive shares in the combined group. Premier’s $400 million of letters of credit will be refinanced.

Chrysaor, a North Sea-focused business founded in 2007, made a big splash in the region in 2017 when it paid $3 billion for a package of assets from Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc. The company, backed by private equity firm Harbour Energy Ltd., has since become the No. 1 oil and gas producer in Britain, having bought assets from Spirit Energy in 2018, as well as ConocoPhillips’s U.K. division.

By Ron Bousso

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) announced on Wednesday plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs, or over 10% of its workforce, as part of a major overhaul to shift the oil and gas giant to low-carbon energy.

Shell, which had 83,000 employees at the end of 2019, said that the reorganisation will lead to additional annual savings of around $2 billion to $2.5 billion by 2022, going partly beyond cuts of $3 to $4 billion announced earlier this year.

Shell's London-traded shares were up 0.15% by 0920 GMT, compared with 0.9% gains for the broader energy sector ( ).

Last month it launched a broad review of its business aimed at cutting costs as it prepares to restructure its operations as part of the shift to low-carbon energy.

The Anglo-Dutch company said it expected to cut 7,000 to 9,000 jobs by the end of 2022, including some 1,500 people who have agreed to take voluntary redundancy this year.

Rival BP (L: ) this year announced plans to cut around 10,000 jobs as part of CEO Bernard Looney's plans to rapidly expand its renewables business and reduce oil and gas production.

Reducing costs is vital for Shell's plans to move into the power sector and renewables where margins are relatively low.

Competition is also likely to intensify with utilities and rival oil firms including BP and Total (PA: ) all battling for market share as economies around the world go green.

""We have looked closely at how we are organised and we feel that, in many places, we have too many layers in the company,"" CEO Ben van Beurden said in an internal interview published on Shell's website.

FUEL SALES RECOVERY

In an operations update, Shell also said its oil and gas production was set to drop sharply in the third quarter to around 3.04 million barrels of oil equivalent per day due to lower output as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and hurricanes that forced offshore platforms to shut down.

Shell, the world's largest fuel retailer, saw a recovery in fuel sales in the third quarter from lows hit in the previous quarter as some countries gradually emerged from lockdown measures.

(Graphic: Shell's oil and gas production https://graphics.reuters.com/SHELL-PRODUCTION/xklvyqjyrvg/chart.png)

In the second quarter, Shell narrowly avoided its first quarterly loss in recent history, helped by a booming trading business. It however announced nearly $16.8 billion in impairment charges after sharply lowering its outlook for oil and gas prices in the wake of the pandemic.

Shell said it will take another impairment charge of $1 to $1.5 billion in the third quarter.

Shell is exploring ways to reduce spending on oil and gas production, its largest division known as upstream, by 30% to 40% through cuts in operating costs and capital spending on new projects, two sources involved with the review told Reuters earlier this month.

""The transformation to a leaner and lower-carbon organisation is the right one for Shell longer term in our view, but with the macro environment still challenging this may take some time to reflect in the share price,"" Barclays (LON: ) analysts said in a note.

Shell said on Wednesday it also plans to reduce the number of its refineries to less than 10 from 17 currently and over 55 15 years ago.

""If we want to get there, if we want to succeed as an integral part of a society heading towards net-zero (carbon) emissions, now is the time to accelerate,"" van Beurden said.

(Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp (N: ), the largest U.S. oil refiner, said it would lay off about 2,050 employees, or 12% of its workforce, at its U.S. operations, excluding Speedway, as the COVID-19 pandemic crushed global demand for motor fuels.

The workforce reduction plan is a result of indefinite idling of its Martinez, California and Gallup, New Mexico refineries, the company said in the filing https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1510295/000151029520000098/mpcform8-k9292020.htm.

Refiners and oil producers have been cutting staff, slashing spending and reducing production to cope with the slump in crude prices and a global glut of fuel.

On Wednesday, Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) said it would dismiss up to 9,000 workers, or 10% of its staff, while oil majors, Chevron Corp (N: ) and Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ), are in the process of restructuring their businesses to halt losses.

Marathon Petroleum said it expects to record charges of about $125 million to $175 million for severance and employee benefits-related expenses as a result of these actions.

The company said it expects the majority of the job cuts to take effect in October 2020.

Reuters had earlier reported about Marathon Petroleum cutting at least 6% of refinery staff at nine U.S. plants.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/top-us-oil-refiner-marathon-petroleum-to-lay-off-12-of-workforce-2223925,0.08,0.92,0.0,-0.9442

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has called for new European Union sanctions against Russia over the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny with an internationally banned nerve agent.

Navalny emerged in recent weeks from a coma after suddenly falling ill during a flight in Siberia and being air-lifted to Berlin for treatment. German doctors say he was poisoned with Novichok, a Russian nerve agent.

Germany, France and other Western countries have demanded an explanation from the Kremlin for Navalny's illness. Russia says it has seen no firm evidence he was poisoned and denies involvement in any attack on him.

""I am convinced that there will be no longer any way around sanctions,"" Maas told news portal t-online in an interview on Saturday.

""Sanctions must always be targeted and proportionate. But such a grave violation of the International Chemical Weapons Convention cannot be left unanswered. On this, we're united in Europe,"" Maas added.

Germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the 27-member bloc. EU leaders will discuss their reaction and possible sanctions against Russia at their next summit on Oct. 15-16.

""If the result of the German, Swedish and French laboratories is confirmed, there will be a clear response from the EU. I'm sure about that,"" Maas said.

The Navalny case has worsened relations between Moscow and a number of Western countries. Germany has faced calls to halt the nearly-completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is meant to bring more Russian gas directly to Germany.

Asked if European sanctions against Russia should include Nord Stream 2, Maas said there were more than 100 European companies involved in the project, half of them in Germany.

""So many European workers would suffer from a construction freeze,"" Maas said.

Nord Stream 2 is led by Russia's state gas giant Gazprom (MM: ), with half of the funding provided by Germany's Uniper (DE: ) and BASF's (DE: ) Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch company Shell (L: ), Austria's OMV (VI: ) and France's Engie (PA: ).",https://uk.investing.com//news/economy/germany-urges-eu-to-impose-sanctions-against-russia-over-navalny-case-2225727,0.105,0.862,0.033,-0.9752

Investing.com -- A chaotic and largely meaningless presidential ‘debate’, strong economic data in China and Europe, a revision to U.S. 2Q GDP – and Disney and Shell (LON: ) cut thousands of jobs. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, September 30th.

1. Two shouty old men

Two old men shouted at each other for a couple of hours in an effort to settle the question of who is better suited to lead the free world and the world’s largest economy.

By common consent, President Donald Trump did not succeed in pressuring his opponent Joe Biden into the kind of gaffes and brain freezes that he has made so much of on social media in recent weeks, despite interrupting him 73 times (according to CBS’s count).

Biden also failed to land any knock-out blows but, given his lead in the polls, is the likelier of the two to be satisfied with an event in which they merely cancelled each other out.

Investors learned nothing new about either candidate’s agenda, except inasmuch as Trump again stoked doubts about his willingness to accept defeat, appearing at one stage to instruct right-wing militias to “stand by” to dispute the result.

2. Big job cuts at Disney, Shell

Companies are getting more urgent and more ambitious with their cost-cutting plans as North America and Europe get ready for a full winter of Covid-19.

Walt Disney (NYSE: ) said it will cut 28,000 jobs from its theme park, retail and cruise operations – many of them part-time – while Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: ) said it will cut up to 9,000 jobs, or 11% of its workforce, to make it fit for a sustained period of low oil prices and a possible long-term decline in demand for oil and gas.

Walt Disney shares fell 2.4% in premarket trading, while Shell stock eked out a modest gain of 0.3%, marginally outperforming the broader market in Europe.

3 Stocks set to open lower; GDP, ADP (NASDAQ: ) eyed

U.S. stocks are set to open lower after a poor advertisement for American democracy reminded investors that electoral risk isn’t something reserved for emerging markets, while Disney’s job cuts pointed to tougher times ahead for the labor market.

By 6:25 AM ET (1025 GMT), were down 231 points, or 0.8%, while were also down 0.7% and were down 0.8%.

Investors are likely to take their cues later from the revision to second-quarter figures, and from ADP’s monthly survey of . In addition, there will be the market debut of cybersecurity firm Palantir, which set a reference price of $7.25 for its stock, valuing it at some $16 billion.

4. Lagarde hints ECB will follow Fed

Christine Lagarde signaled that the European Central Bank may follow the Federal Reserve in a formal commitment to let inflation run above its traditional 2% target when it concludes its review of its monetary policy strategy next year.

Lagarde’s comments came against the backdrop of some better-than-expected high-frequency data: rose 3.1% in August and July’s figures were also revised up. also outperformed expectations with a 2.3% rise in August., while German numbers fell modestly, in line with expectations. The fell 0.2% to $1.1709.

Purchasing manager data from China earlier had shown a recovery still intact, but flattening out after a sharp rebound through the summer.

5. Oil slides ahead of stockpile data

Crude oil prices were again testing two-week lows as stock markets responded gloomily to the election debate, on the perception that a disputed result to the election may spin out the usual uncertainty that weighs on markets every four years.

By 6:25 AM ET, futures were down 1.2% at $38.84 a barrel, while , the international benchmark, was down 1.3% at $41.01 a barrel.

(Bloomberg) -- Tens of thousands of job cuts announced by blue-chip companies in the last 24 hours are a warning sign for the world’s recovery and emerge just ahead of two key reports forecast to show limited progress in the U.S. labor market.

In one of the biggest layoff announcements since the pandemic caused widespread economic shutdowns, Walt Disney (NYSE: ) Co. said it’s slashing 28,000 workers in its slumping U.S. resort business and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc will cut as many as 9,000 jobs as crude’s crash forces billions of dollars in cost savings.

Announcements like these point to further challenges in a rebound that’s already slowed after an initial bounce back in May and June. Weekly figures due Thursday are estimated to show filings for U.S. unemployment benefits remain far above pre-virus levels, while Friday’s jobs report is expected to reveal that employers added a half-million fewer workers in September than in August.

With the pandemic still raging and U.S. lawmakers having failed so far to reach an agreement on extending federal relief for the unemployed and small businesses, many key measures in the world’s largest economy look set to remain weak for some time. While the first wave of job cuts hit service workers the hardest -- in industries such as restaurants and entertainment -- economists see other higher-paid positions at increasing risk of layoffs as the recovery grinds slowly forward.

Particularly hard-hit are also companies reliant on travel and tourism, including Disney. American Airlines (NASDAQ: ) Group Inc. has warned that it could furlough 19,000 employees, while United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: ) Inc. is planning to cut about 12,000.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Wednesday, as the chaotic nature of the first presidential debate raised concerns of a contested election result.

By 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), traded 17 points, or 0.5%, lower, the contract fell 170 points, or 0.6%, while dropped 67 points, or 0.6%.

The major U.S. cash indices are on course to close down for the month, for the first time since March. Indeed, as it stands, this would be the weakest September for stocks since 2011.

President Trump and his Democratic challenger, former Vice President Biden, faced off in their first debate of the campaign in Cleveland on Tuesday, an event that offered little of substance with both sides seemingly keen to trade insults.

Trump again declined to say he would accept the results of the election, instead railing against mail-in ballots and warning that the contest would not “end well.”

""Investors have gone back to worrying about a contested election, a delay in the outcome and whether Trump will go peacefully if he loses,"" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP (OTC: ) Capital, in a Reuters report.

Meanwhile, the United States recorded 42,185 new coronavirus infections and 914 virus-related deaths on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a citywide daily rate of positive virus tests of 3.25%, the highest daily rate since June.

On the data slate, the third print for Q2 is expected to be unchanged, showing a drop of 31.7%, is forecast to show a bump of 650,000 for September from 428,000 in the previous month, and are forecast to have increased 3.2% in August from July, when they rose 5.9%.

In corporate news, the focus is likely to be on Palantir (NYSE: ), as the data-mining firm starts trading on the New York Stock Exchange via a direct listing. The company has attracted a lot of interest since starting in 2003, backed by money from the CIA to develop software for the government.

Oil prices fell Wednesday, continuing the sharp losses of the previous session, on the back of worries about future consumption. Oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) vividly illustrated these concerns, saying it’s set to cut up to 9,000 more jobs.

Investors now await crude inventory data from the , after the industry body on Tuesday showed a draw of 831,000 barrels for last week.

futures traded 0.9% lower at $38.95 a barrel, while the international benchmark contract fell 1.1% to $41.12. Both contracts closed more than 3% lower on Tuesday.

Stock market crash: which of these dividend-paying UK shares could make you filthy rich?

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

2020 has been a difficult time for dividend investors. Hundreds of UK shares have axed, postponed, or reduced shareholder payouts in response to the Covid-19 outbreak and its significant economic impact. There could be more drastic action coming down the pipe should the global economy endure a painful and prolonged downturn too.

There are plenty of UK shares that continue to offer chunky yields. But which of these British stocks should you buy and which should you avoid?

Danger ahead! Royal Dutch Shell’s 5.5% dividend yield looks quite delicious. But the multitude of problems the oilie faces makes this UK share a risk too far in my book. It’s not just the short-term troubles it faces as the slumping global economy smacks oil demand.

The fight Shell (LON: ) has to adapt to renewables threatens to create plenty of problems over a longer time horizon too. The fossil fuels giant may struggle to keep pace with nimbler green energy operators and faces a sharp slump in crude sales in the meantime.

I wouldn’t be tempted to buy Land Securities either, despite its tasty 4.5% forward dividend yield. In July, the property trust announced plans to reinstate dividends later this fiscal year. But I’m more than a little sceptical that it’ll be able to fulfil this aim.

Shaftesbury illustrated the huge pressure on retail property owners by declaring last week that almost 60% of its own rents due for the second half had gone unpaid. Land Securities has also seen rents plummet since the Covid-19 outbreak, and the end of the government support in the coming months threatens to exacerbate the problem.

A better dividend stock In my opinion, investors seeking chubby dividends from UK shares would be better off investing in Begbies Traynor. Yields here aren’t the biggest (for 2020 its reading sits at 3.4%). But this sort of inflation-beating figure can still provide a decent return for your money. And, in my opinion, the insolvency services expert is in much better shape to keep growing in the current climate.

British Chambers of Commerce data shows that almost half of British businesses reported falling sales in the third quarter, while two-thirds have seen their cash flows keep deteriorating. Counter-cyclical shares like Begbies Traynor are ideal UK shares in times like these. And, unfortunately, the historic slump in the British economy suggests its services will surge in the short-to-medium term.

Helping you to get rich and retire early with UK shares Bebgies Traynor’s just one quality UK share I’d buy to receive big dividends in the near term and beyond though. The London Stock Exchange is packed with income heroes like these. And with the help of The Motley Fool and its huge library of special reports you can find top dividend stocks that could make you rich despite the global economic downturn. So do some research and get investing today.

SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

By Geoffrey Smith

Investing.com -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) is cutting costs as fast as it can, but it still can’t promise a turnaround in profitability.

The Anglo-Dutch oil major said on Wednesday it will cut between 7,000 and 9,000 jobs by the end of 2022 – representing 8%-11% of its global workforce – in an effort to make itself fit for a period of sustained low prices and a possible long-term decline in demand for fossil fuels.

The move had been flagged weeks ago by CEO Ben van Beurden, who said in a statement on the company’s website that “we have too many layers in the company: too many levels between me, as the CEO, and the operators and technicians at our locations.”

Before the pandemic, such an announcement would almost certainly have been greeted with enthusiasm by investors who would have seen it as safeguarding the company’s profitability and hence their precious dividend. However, investors no longer believe that the good days will ever return. When Shell cut its dividend in the summer, for the first time since World War 2, it effectively acknowledged as much.

Van Beurden is leading his remaining investors into the terra incognita of the energy transition and all that is known about that is that electricity – especially renewable electricity - has been a lot less profitable than oil and gas for as long as anyone can remember.

Even if Shell can make a success of transitioning to a new, green energy model, it still has to manage a balance sheet full of oil and gas assets for which it paid billions, and which may never be monetized. The company said impairments in the third quarter would be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, a sharp drop from the write-offs earlier in the year, but still a move that points to ongoing pressure on the asset side of the balance sheet.

Such pressure is feeding market doubts that Shell will be able to sustain a payout that it has already cut by two-thirds. After a modest 0.4% rise on Wednesday morning, Shell stock now yields 5.2%, a return that is jarringly out of line with the broader market.

Optimists will argue that the stabilization of crude prices – and the cyclical rebound that has always followed periods when the industry has cut back investment in new fields – makes Shell at least a bet that can go both ways from here. After all, the stock has lost over one-third of its value since June and 60% since last September. Skeptics will want to see the company's rising debt ratio, or gearing, stabilize before they are convinced.

Shell can surely one day expect a cyclical tailwind to turn its stock around. However, the secular headwind that is climate change and an investment focus on mitigating it is never going to fade.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-shell-adds-a-chapter-to-big-oils-2020-tale-of-woe-2223187,0.093,0.78,0.127,0.9685

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) has provisionally booked a tanker to load a crude cargo at Libya's Zueitina terminal on Oct. 3, potentially the first since January at the recently reopened port.

The Amoureux tanker is expected to load a 1 million barrel cargo and then discharge in Singapore on Oct. 22, Refinitiv Eikon shipping data showed.

Shell declined to comment on the booking.

Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) lifted force majeure on crude loadings at the port on Sept. 22.

The north African country has seen an uptick in export activity this week following the easing of the blockade imposed by eastern forces in January, which the NOC said cost the country around $10 billion in lost revenue.

The Delta Hellas oil tanker loaded a 1 million barrel crude cargo for Unipec, trading arm of China's Sinopec (SS: ), at the Hariga terminal this week.

Refinitiv Eikon data shows the vessel has left the port and is making its way towards Egypt's Port Said.

Unipec now has a second tanker docked at Hariga, the Marlin Shikoku, which is expected to load a second cargo for the trader.

Mesla and Sarir crudes load at Hariga.

NOC said it expects to raise its oil output to 260,000 barrels per day next week.

LONDON (Reuters) - United Nations climate envoy Mark Carney on Thursday threw his weight behind a growing push by investors for companies to more accurately reflect climate-related risks in their financial accounts.

Such risks can range from physical dangers such as water levels rising and destroying factories, to new regulations putting a higher price on carbon emissions, for example, which could render products and services redundant or in need of new pricing, impacting profits and contingent liabilities.

Already this year, leading oil majors including BP (LON: ) and Shell (LON: ) have written down the value of their assets after revising long-term oil price assumptions, which underpin decisions such as capital expenditure and impairments, and investors are now calling on the process to be expanded to all companies.

Last week, investor groups representing more than $103 trillion in assets wrote an open letter calling on companies and auditors to follow guidance from the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) released last year.

That statement, in the form of an IASB 'opinion', made clear that factoring climate risks into company accounts is already required within the existing rules, if relevant and material, even though most companies have yet to do so.

Specifically, the investor groups, which include the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, said companies needed to explain the key assumptions made with regard to climate risk and make sure they are compatible with the goals of the Paris climate agreement.

Auditors, meanwhile, needed to only sign off accounts that were consistent with the IASB opinion in ""letter and spirit"". Regulators and civil society then needed to support the implementation of the opinion.

Speaking at a UN PRI webinar on Thursday, Carney, who has long championed the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures - a framework to help companies assess and manage the risks of climate change - said the conclusions also needed to be reflected in company profit and loss statements.

""It's recognising that when climate change risks are considered material that, just as any other financial risk, there should be disclosures included.""

""If they (company boards) don't think Paris-compliant assumptions are relevant for the valuing of assets, then it's important that that is known.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/carney-backs-call-for-climate-risk-to-be-baked-into-company-financial-accounts-2219456,0.062,0.835,0.103,0.9349

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Wednesday, with investors acting cautiously following a heated first U.S. presidential debate and despite data suggesting China’s recovery remains on track.

At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the contract in Germany traded 1% lower, in France dropped 0.9% and the contract in the U.K. fell 0.7%.

Chinese data released earlier Wednesday showed that the world’s second-largest economy's recovery continues to progress. The September came in at 51.5, beating August’s 51 reading, and the was 55.9 against August’s 55.2 - both remaining above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.

“China has been in the lead in terms of the Asia recovery story, but there is little doubt that its recovery also helps pull the rest of Asia along in its wake,” wrote ING’s Robert Carnell, in a research note.

However, this positive economic news has been unable to persuade investors to put their money to work, judging by the weak tone in the futures markets, with Covid-19 infections on the rise again globally and after a contentious presidential debate in which President Donald Trump again cast doubt on whether he would accept the election's outcome.

""What people are most concerned about is the fairness of the election and how it will be carried out...under normal circumstances, the positive economic data from China we've seen would support risk-on trades, but this time is different,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE: ) Trust Bank in Tokyo, in a Reuters report.

Turning back to Europe, the was revised to show a drop of 19.8% in the second quarter compared with the first, after the initial estimate showed a drop of 20.4%, while rose a better than expected 3.% in August.

Later in the session sees the release of for September, which will be studied carefully as an indicator of the strength of the economic recovery in Europe’s largest economy.

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 traded in a range-bound manner on Wednesday and was headed for a second monthly decline in six as growing economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as Brexit subdued risk appetite.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 ( ) dropped 0.1%, led by oil and gas <.FTNM0530> and healthcare stocks ( ), while the mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) was flat, with analysts warning of higher volatility during the session as investors rebalance their portfolios at the end of the quarter.

Meanwhile, data confirmed that Britain's economy shrank by a record 19.8% in the second quarter when COVID-19 lockdown measures were in force, slightly less than the initial estimate of a 20.4% fall.

""It is clear that until rising uncertainties over U.S. elections, Brexit and COVID-19 are addressed in a more definite manner and markets see more positive forward looking data, investors are going to stay away from risk assets,"" said Andrea Cicione, a strategist at T.S. Lombard.

Fears of further economic stress due to rising COVID-19 cases, coupled with Brexit uncertainty, have washed out gains seen over the previous month and dampened risk sentiment.

The global mood was subdued on Wednesday after a chaotic first U.S. presidential debate turned investors cautious, though strong Chinese factory surveys gave a boost to Asian shares. [MKTS/GLOB]

UGHELLI, Delta State, Nigeria (Reuters) - Jonah Gbemre often has no electricity, but he says his home is permanently lit at night by the flames of waste gas being ""flared"" near his home town in Nigeria's Delta State.

Like Gbemre, nearly half of Nigerians have no stable power supply, yet government attempts to harness gas belching from its oil fields to generate urgently-needed electricity or revenue have stalled.

And experts say that without progress towards its 2030 target of virtually eliminating flaring, which releases carbon dioxide along with polluting methane and soot, Nigeria cannot meet its pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20%.

(Graphic - Gas Flaring and Nigeria's CO2 Emissions: https://graphics.reuters.com/NIGERIA-OIL/GASFLARING/xklvyqmljvg/chart.png)

""This flare site makes the nights like days,"" said 42-year-old Gbemre, his eyes both bloodshot and milky, something he said his doctor attributes to the burning of the waste gas.

Reuters could not establish if there was any link between Gbemre's eye problems and the flaring. Nigeria's National Oil Spill Detection & Response Agency has said the practice can damage human health and the environment.

After sunset, nearly 200 blinking flares dot the landscape around Port Harcourt, the Delta oil hub. Experts say the gas that Nigeria flares nationwide could be worth billions of dollars if captured and transported to be used as liquefied or for plastics or fertilizers.

(Graphic - Flaring costs Nigeria millions in lost revenue: https://graphics.reuters.com/NIGERIA-OIL/GASFLARING/ygdvzkneypw/chart.png)

But a 2016 programme by the Nigerian government to address this by auctioning rights to capture and sell flared gas is struggling, six sources close to the process told Reuters.

The coronavirus crisis has compounded delays to a project which the World Bank hoped could serve as an example in its bid to cut global warming through zero flaring globally by 2030.

Oil-producing nations all flare some gas, particularly at remote fields or where there is ageing infrastructure.

(Graphic - Top 30 Gas Flaring Countries in 2019: https://graphics.reuters.com/NIGERIA-OIL/GASFLARING/yxmvjbjywvr/chart.png)

Nigeria first targeted gas flaring in the late 1970s and, through various schemes and regulations, has more than halved it since 2001. Chevron (NYSE: ), Shell (LON: ) and Eni, which operate in Nigeria, say they have cut flaring by some 90% and are working to cut it further. ExxonMobil (NYSE: ) and Total declined comment.

But as the largest sites were harnessed, progress stagnated and flaring rose last year, a government-run satellite tracker shows, while Gbemre has little faith in the state, which he notes missed its own deadlines in 2004, 2008 and 2020.

(Graphic - Gas flared by company field ownership in 2018: https://graphics.reuters.com/NIGERIA-OIL/GASFLARING/xlbvgjwdjpq/chart.png)

Although Nigeria's Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) approved 200 bidders in February, it said in June, when the sites should have been awarded, that the process was delayed by six weeks due to coronavirus-related restrictions.

""If this bidding round doesn't succeed, that's the end of it,"" said Gbite Adeniji, a lawyer who helped design the programme as a technical advisor at Nigeria's Ministry of Petroleum, adding that roughly $3 billion is needed to commercialize the remaining flares, with site costs ranging from $20 million to $100 million.

The sources, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said many bidders have already pulled out as many were unlikely to recoup their costs.

'LACK OF TRUST'

Only 48 of the nearly 180 sites still flaring in Nigeria are on the DPR list, many of them are not commercially viable and some of the best are missing, they added.

""The pool was three times smaller than they thought,"" one source said of the sites.

Gas output at some, where oilfields are in decline, is likely to end within 5-10 years and others are offshore, making the required infrastructure more costly, the sources added.

DPR did not respond to a request for comment on how it selected the flare sites, when it will announce winners or whether it was committed to the auction process.

Two bidders told Reuters they dropped out early this year as delays made them question Nigeria's commitment.

Oneal Lajuwomi, chief executive of Wavelength, said his energy company spent $20,000, but decided it was not worth putting in more cash, deterred by what he said was poor data, including on the gas produced and how long it would last.

""How do you determine the economic viability of the project if you don't know these things? The issue for us and a lot of people was a lack of trust,"" Lajuwomi said.

Delays hurt bidders, who must revise the timeline with their financial backers and sometimes make costly revisions to feasibility studies to stay in contention.

One bidder still in the process and another source close to it said that the DPR's silence had spooked some funders who have been deterred by the unpredictable timeline and have less cash available due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The sources said that the DPR and the Minister of Petroleum had used their legal power to grant ""exemptions"" to sites, which can keep them from being auctioned.

Neither the DPR nor the Ministry of Petroleum responded to several requests for comment on this.

'THERE'S NO MONEY'

The World Bank said that it was not involved in the bidding or selection of flare sites, adding that Nigeria, along with Ecuador, Egypt, Mexico, Indonesia and Iraq, had made progress.

(Graphic - The gas flared in Nigeria has dropped significantly: https://graphics.reuters.com/NIGERIA-OIL/GASFLARING/jznvnljowvl/chart.png)

However, observers said Nigeria's troubled power sector, combined with the location and size of some sites, made it almost impossible for an investor to make money selling gas to it, despite electricity tariffs that were roughly doubled.

""It's going to get harder and harder to totally eliminate the flares, because many of them are quite small,"" Gail Anderson, upstream research director at Wood Mackenzie, said, adding: ""Many of these are in sort of remote locations.""

Renaissance Capital analyst Nikolas Stefanou echoed the power sector issues, and said other buyers are often too small.

""The problem is being able to effectively find a reliable demand source,"" Stefanou said.

And even as state oil company NNPC and the Ministry of Petroleum announced plans to expand demand for fuels made from gas, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), DPR and a national oil company subsidiary have also added fees to it.

Such issues make it tougher for those hoping to make money from flared gas to find buyers.

Back in Ughelli, a 20-foot wall of burning gas sends waves of heat over Root Ohoteka and four of her children. She uses the high temperature to dry cassava flakes, which she sells.

The intense heat speeds up the process, but the 25-year-old told Reuters she would rather find another way to feed her family as she is worried about the effects the fumes will have on their health.

In the past 21 months of the Lopez Obrador administration, Pemex has lost roughly 13% of Mexico’s gasoline market to private companies, compared with 4.5% in the previous 35 months since Mexico liberalized its fuels market, according government figures compiled by Bloomberg. His government is now seeking to dial back the reforms that have allowed the world’s biggest players to wrest business from Pemex.

“The cracks are beginning to appear” in AMLO’s energy policies, said Rajan Vig, founder of independent oil-trading firm Indimex in Mexico City. “Demand continues to exist. In fact, it has increased. And if you restrict supply, people are going to have to find more creative ways of bringing in the product.”

In 2016, Mexico allowed companies other than Pemex to import, distribute and sell fuels for the first time since the industry was nationalized in 1938. Since then, the world’s top energy companies have invested aggressively in Mexico, with oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, BP (NYSE: ) Plc, Chevron Corp (NYSE: ) and Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ) opening thousands of gasoline stations, and international trading houses including Koch Industries Inc., Glencore (OTC: ) Plc and Trafigura Beheer BV building fuel storage, transport and logistics infrastructure to bring more barrels into the country.

Those efforts are bearing fruit. At the end of August, private companies were supplying about 17.5% of total gasoline volumes in the country and approximately 27% of diesel, fuels production and imports data from the energy ministry show. While Pemex saw a jump in diesel imports in August, in June and July private companies imported more diesel than the state-owned oil company for the first time.

The trend bodes poorly for the Lopez Obrador administration, which has pledged to strengthen Pemex by dialing back the 2013-2014 energy reforms of the previous administration. Last week, AMLO told energy regulators in a closed-door meeting to stop issuing new permits for fuel retailers and energy infrastructure. He said that he will consider changing the constitution in the next three years if his goal of reversing output declines at Pemex can’t be met under current laws.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) has drawn up plans to make its German operations carbon-neutral as it seeks to cut its own and customers' emissions by more than a third over a decade.

The energy company is expected to announce a restructuring by the end of the year as it prepares to accelerate its global shift towards low-carbon operations, having set a goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

""We support Germany in becoming a country with net zero emissions. The transformation of Shell in Germany has begun and will accelerate"", Germany head Fabian Ziegler said in a statement.

At its Cologne Rheinland refinery, the oil major is planning to hike production capacity for ""green hydrogen"" tenfold by 2030, Shell said. Hydrogen is considered a green fuel when electricity from renewable energy sources is used in its production.

Setting up offshore wind farms, from which part of the electricity would be used to produce green hydrogen, is an element in Shell's contribution to Germany's energy shift, the company added.

The oil major also plans to equip its petrol filling stations with around 1,000 fast charging stations for electronic vehicles by 2030.

Separately, Shell is planning to switch to production of low-carbon energy solutions and special chemicals at the Rheinland refinery, as part of its long-term plan to replace processing there with other activities.

Earlier on Tuesday, Shell-owned German residential solar battery maker sonnen said it was extending capacity as demand for home storage systems is expected to grow with the ending of subsidy programmes for supplying renewable power to the grid.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-sets-out-steps-to-make-german-activities-carbonneutral-2222725,0.012,0.937,0.051,0.872

(Bloomberg) -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc will cut as many as 9,000 jobs as Covid-19 precipitates a companywide restructuring into low-carbon energy.

Job reductions of 7,000 to 9,000 are expected by the end of 2022, including around 1,500 people taking voluntary redundancy this year, Shell said Wednesday in a statement. The company sees sustainable annual cost savings of $2 billion to $2.5 billion by that time.

“We have to be a simpler, more streamlined, more competitive organization,” Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said. “We feel that, in many places, we have too many layers in the company: too many levels between me, as the CEO, and the operators and technicians at our locations.”

The move adds to the growing list of major announcements this year which has seen Big Oil slash dividends, take multibillion-dollar writedowns and ax jobs following oil’s coronavirus-induced plunge. BP (NYSE: ) Plc said in June it planned to cut 10,000 jobs as it moved into cleaner energy, Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ) intends to trim 10% to 15% of its global workforce, while Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). is reviewing staffing country by country.

Shell began the process in May, when Van Beurden told staff in a memo that it was reshaping the company to make it leaner and more resilient and that there could be redundancies in the second half of the year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The Anglo-Dutch major offered voluntary severance, scaled back recruitment and reviewed expatriate staff contracts.

The reorganization is also designed to further Shell’s expanded green ambitions. The company said in April it planned to eliminate all net emissions from its own operations and the bulk of greenhouse gases from fuel it sells to its customers by 2050. Shell also said that ultimately, it would only do business with emission-free companies.

The company also flagged on Wednesday that it expects oil-product sales volumes in the third quarter to be 4 million to 5 million barrels a day. Refining margins will be “significantly” lower than in the second quarter. It also sees post-tax impairment charges of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.

Shell is scheduled to publish quarterly results on Oct. 29.

(Reuters) - Bids for a portfolio of Exxon Mobil 's (N: ) British North Sea oil and gas fields, which is expected to fetch around $1 billion following this year's oil price weakness, are due on Oct. 28, two sources with knowledge of the process said.

Parties that have signalled interest in acquiring more assets in the basin include private-equity (PE) firm HitecVision's Neo, EIG's Chrysaor and listed companies, such as EnQuest (L: ).

Commodities trading house Mercuria, via producer Tailwind, is also considering the portfolio, two sources said on condition of anonymity. Eni (MI: ), via its joint venture Var with HitecVision, has been buying assets in the Norwegian North Sea.

""It will be interesting to see in November/December the outcome of Exxon's UK sale as these competing forms of capital - stock market, PE Funds, Traders - assess who can get most value from this situation,"" one of the sources said.

Any buyer will likely seek to operate the assets, the sources said.

Established independent producers in the British North Sea, such as EnQuest and Premier (L: ), are burdened with debt.

Premier is trying to raise equity to buy BP (LON: ) assets, whose past losses could be used to reduce future tax bills, but is also in talks with Chrysaor on alternative deals.

Hitec is considering an acquisition of Suncor's (TO: ) North Sea assets, one of the sources said.

Most of Exxon's British operations are managed through Esso Exploration and Production UK, a 50-50 joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell (L: ).

The portfolio under discussion, which excludes assets in the southern North Sea, produces around 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is expected to increase to just under 60,000 boe/d by around 2023, the sources said.

Initially, Exxon hoped to raise over $2 billion from the sale and it was planned for late last year. In June sources told Reuters the portfolio was more likely to fetch $1 to $1.5 billion given the oil price weakness this year.

HitecVision, EnQuest, Exxon, Mercuria and Chrysaor all declined comment.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/bids-for-exxon-uks-oil-and-gas-fields-due-on-october-28-sources-2216159,0.027,0.906,0.067,0.9034

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday on the potential return of output from Libya as rising coronavirus cases also added to worries about global demand, although a tropical storm heading for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico limited losses.

Brent crude ( ) was down 33 cents, or 0.8%, at $42.82 a barrel by 0645 GMT, while U.S. crude ( ) was down 38 cents, or 0.9%, to $40.73 a barrel.

Workers at Libya's major Sharara field have restarted operations, two engineers working there said, after National Oil Corporation announced a partial lifting of force majeure. But it was still unclear when production might restart.

""The market can ill afford more crude hitting the market,"" ANZ analysts said in a note on Monday, at a time when coronavirus-related curbs have eroded demand.

More than 30.78 million people have been infected by the novel coronavirus and 954,843​ have died globally, a Reuters tally shows, paralysing travel and business activity.

""It is hard to get excited about a pickup in crude demand as the virus is surging in France, Spain, and the UK, along with concerns the U.S. appears poised for at least one more cycle in the fall and winter,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.

""Even if energy markets don't see Libyan production return or if hurricane season eases, oil prices can't shake off the dwindling demand outlook.""

Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) halted some oil production and began evacuating workers from a U.S. Gulf of Mexico platform, the company said on Saturday.

Tropical Storm Beta was predicted to bring 1 foot (30 centimetres) of rain to parts of coastal Texas and Louisiana as the 23rd named storm of this year's Atlantic hurricane season moves ashore on Monday night, the National Hurricane Center said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) halted some oil production and began evacuating workers from a U.S. Gulf of Mexico platform, the company said on Saturday, as a new tropical storm flared.

Beta, the 23rd named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the Bay of Campeche and was forecast to gradually strengthen and soak the Texas coast all week, the National Hurricane Center said.

The storm swirled even as oil and gas producers were restarting their offshore operations. Some 17% of U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore oil production and nearly 13% of output was offline on Saturday from Hurricane Sally's waves and winds.

The NHC reduced its maximum wind forecast to 75 miles per hour (120 kph), just above tropical storm intensity. Drier air aloft will limit Beta's strength and may prevent it from becoming a hurricane, the NHC said in a Saturday update.

Shell said it was removing non-essential employees from its Perdido platform in the western Gulf of Mexico and securing nearby drilling rigs. Occidental Petroleum Corp (N: ), which operates in the same area, said it also began implementing storm procedures.

BP (L: ), Hess Corp . (N: ) and Murphy Oil Corp . (N: ) were monitoring conditions on Saturday, spokespeople for the companies said. Beta churned about 245 miles (395 km) south of Lake Charles, Louisiana, with 60 mph winds at 1 p.m. CDT (1800 GMT), the NHC said. It issued a hurricane watch for most of the Texas coast and warned of up to 10 inches (25 cm) of rain along the northwest Gulf coast from the slow moving storm.

If Beta reaches hurricane strength, with maximum winds greater than 74 mph on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it would be the third Gulf of Mexico hurricane in less than a month. Hurricane Sally slammed into Alabama on Wednesday with winds of up to 105 mph (170 kph) and Laura hit southwest Louisiana with 150 mph winds.

There were 24 platforms awaiting the return of work crews on Saturday, down from 149 earlier in the week. Some 323,000 barrels of oil and 339 million cubic feet of natural gas output remained offline by Gulf of Mexico producers that had shut output ahead of Hurricane Sally, the U.S. Department of Interior said.

By Ron Bousso

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) is looking to slash up to 40% off the cost of producing oil and gas in a major drive to save cash so it can overhaul its business and focus more on renewable energy and power markets, sources told Reuters.

Shell's new cost-cutting review, known internally as Project Reshape and expected to be completed this year, will affect its three main divisions and any savings will come on top of a $4 billion target set in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.

Reducing costs is vital for Shell's plans to move into the power sector and renewables where margins are relatively low. Competition is also likely to intensify with utilities and rival oil firms including BP (LON: ) and Total all battling for market share as economies around the world go green.

""We had a great model but is it right for the future? There will be differences, this is not just about structure but culture and about the type of company we want to be,"" said a senior Shell source, who declined to be named.

Last year, Shell's overall operating costs came to $38 billion and capital spending totalled $24 billion.

Shell is exploring ways to reduce spending on oil and gas production, its largest division known as upstream, by 30% to 40% through cuts in operating costs and capital spending on new projects, two sources involved with the review told Reuters.

Shell now wants to focus its oil and gas production on a few key hubs, including the Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria and the North Sea, the sources said.

The company's integrated gas division, which runs Shell's liquefied (LNG) operations as well as some gas production, is also looking at deep cuts, the sources said.

For downstream, the review is focusing on cutting costs from Shell's network of 45,000 service stations - the world's biggest - which is seen as one its ""most high-value activities"" and is expected to play a pivotal role in the transition, two more sources involved with the review told Reuters.

""We are undergoing a strategic review of the organisation, which intends to ensure we are set up to thrive throughout the energy transition and be a simpler organisation, which is also cost competitive. We are looking at a range of options and scenarios at this time, which are being carefully evaluated,"" a spokeswoman for Shell said in a statement.

Shell's restructuring drive mirrors moves in recent months by European rivals BP and Eni which both plan to reduce their focus on oil and gas in the coming decade and build new low-carbon businesses.

The review, which company sources say is the largest in Shell's modern history, is expected to be completed by the end of 2020 when Shell wants to announce a major restructuring. It will hold an investor day in February 2021.

Speaking to analysts on July 30, Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said Shell had launched a programme to ""redesign"" the Anglo-Dutch company.

LOW-CARBON FUELS

Teams in Shell's three main divisions are also studying how to reshape the business by cutting thousands of jobs and removing management layers both to save money and create a nimbler company as it prepares to restructure, the sources said.

Shell, which had 83,000 employees at the end of 2019, carried out a major cost-cutting drive after its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group 2016, which has helped boost its cash generation significantly in recent years.

Shell's operating costs, which include production, manufacturing, sales, distribution, administration and research and development expenses, fell by 15%, or roughly $7 billion, between 2014 and 2017.

But the sharp global economic slowdown in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic coupled with Shell's plans to slash its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 have led to the new push.

Shell cut its 2020 capital expenditure plans by $5 billion to $20 billion in the wake of the collapse in oil and gas prices due to the pandemic amid warnings it could have lasting effects on global energy demand.

Van Beurden said in July that Shell was on track to deliver $3 billion to $4 billion in cost savings by the end of March 2021, including through job cuts and suspending bonuses.

He said travel restrictions during the pandemic had accelerated the digitalisation of Shell while machine learning was being rolled out to minimise outages and shorten maintenance time at refineries, oil and gas platforms and LNG plants.

Besides cutting costs at its downstream retail business, Shell is pressing ahead with plans to reduce the number of its oil refineries to 10 from 17 last year. It has already agreed to sell three.

The review of refining operations also includes finding ways to sharply increase the production of low-carbon fuels such biofuels, chemicals and lubricants. That could be done by using low-carbon raw materials such as cooking oil, one source said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusive-shell-launches-major-costcutting-drive-to-prepare-for-energy-transition-2215607,0.039,0.9,0.061,0.9619

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway said on Monday it would finance 16.8 billion crowns (1.42 billion pounds) out of an estimated total investment of 25.1 billion crowns for what could be the world's first full-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project.

CCS has been cited by governments, energy companies and industry for decades as central to plans to reduce emissions and move to a lower-carbon future, but development has been slow and there are few commercial projects in existence in the world.

Under the plan, the Norwegian government would fund a carbon capture project at a cement factory in southern Norway operated by Germany's Heidelberg Cement (DE: ).

The government would also finance a facility at a waste incineration plant in Oslo operated by Finland's Fortum (HE: ) - if the latter can find external financial support.

Oslo will also finance Northern Lights, a joint venture between European oil majors Equinor (OL: ), Shell (L: ) and Total (PA: ) that would transport and bury the captured emissions in an offshore geological formation in the North Sea.

Named Longship after the vessel used by Vikings, the project was a ""milestone in the Government's industry and climate efforts"", Prime Minister Erna Solberg said.

""The project will lead to emission cuts, and facilitate development of new technology and thus new jobs,"" she told a news conference.

This is the second time the oil-producing nation has tried to launch CCS. A decade ago Norway tried to capture greenhouse gas emissions at a gas power plant.

State oil firm Equinor (OL: ), then called Statoil , failed to execute the plan, touted as Norway's moon landing, because of insurmountable cost issues.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/norway-to-spend-18-billion-on-worlds-first-fullscale-ccs-chain-2215935,0.038,0.946,0.016,-0.7992

BRASILIA (Reuters) - A second justice on Brazil's Supreme Court has voted against allowing state-owned oil company Petrobras (SA: ) to go ahead with the planned sale of eight refineries, according to a court document reviewed by Reuters.

Justice Ricardo Lewandowski's vote to stop the privatizations comes after justice Edson Fachin similarly voted against it on Friday. Brazil's Congress had requested that the court suspend the transactions.

The Supreme Court has until Sept. 25 to rule on the matter, with the other nine justices yet to cast their votes.

Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, is in talks to sell refineries in Bahia and Parana states as part of an overall divestment plan that aims to sell eight refineries.

The company is in exclusive talks to sell the Rlam refinery in Bahia to Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala Investment Co.

MANILA (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L: ) is looking to sell its 45% stake in the Malampaya gas-to-power project in the Philippines, a key power source for the country's main island of Luzon, its local unit said on Thursday.

""As part of an ongoing portfolio rationalisation to simplify and increase the resilience of its business, Shell is exploring its options with a view to divest its interest"" in Malampaya, a spokeswoman told Reuters.

""Shell would ensure a smooth transition of the asset to a credible buyer who would be well placed to optimise the value from Malampaya,"" the spokeswoman said in response to emailed questions, without naming any potential buyers.

In what it called a ""strategic"" move to secure the long-term sustainability of its business amid the COVID-19 pandemic, local unit Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp (PS: ) last month decided to permanently shut down its refinery.

The decision comes as Shell is looking to slash up to 40% off the cost of producing oil and gas in a major drive to save cash so it can overhaul its business and focus more on renewable energy and power markets, sources told Reuters.

Malampaya's , discovered in 1991 by Shell, fuels four power plants that deliver about a fifth of the country's electricity requirements.

The divestment plan also comes about a year after Chevron (N: ) agreed to sell its 45% interest in the project to Philippine oil and shipping group Udenna Corp.

The remaining 10% interest in the Malampaya project is held by state-owned Philippine National Oil Company.

Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said: ""I'm not aware of who they (Shell) are negotiating with. What I know is they are looking for a buyer.""

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Shareholders of Unilever NV (AS: ) in the Netherlands are expected to back plans to unify the consumer goods giant under a single parent company based in London and end 90 years as an Anglo-Dutch hybrid.

The result of an online vote will be released on Monday during an extraordinary shareholders' meeting streamed online due to the coronavirus, with investors in British Unilever Plc (L: ) due to vote on Oct. 12. If approved by both sides, Unilever hopes to unify on Nov. 22.

The maker of Dove soap, Surf detergent and Ben & Jerry's ice cream has argued that the dual national structure hampers its ability to conduct acquisitions and disposals quickly, such as the planned sale of its three-billion euro tea business.

""My guess is that [the vote] will pass and it will give Unilever a simpler organisational structure, making it easier for effective management actions to take place,"" said Steve Clayton, UK fund manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown (LON: ) Select Fund range, whose UK Income fund has a 6.2 percent weighting in Unilever.

Unilever began its push to restructure under previous management after a failed $143 billion takeover approach by Kraft Heinz (O: ) in February 2017.

Tax and political considerations thwarted its first attempt to unify in Rotterdam in 2018, with concerns about a 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax and forced selling by some UK shareholders once Unilever was dropped from 100.

Now, Britain's departure from the European Union gives some extra urgency, as a delay beyond this year could mean that the marriage of the company's two arms could face additional scrutiny from EU and British regulators as a cross-border merger.

""We are definitely in favour of the reunification. The situation has been running on for far too long and has presented an unnecessary distraction,"" said Freddie Lait, chief investment officer of Latitude Investment management. ""It makes complete sense ... and it should not be controversial.""

Glass Lewis, an independent share advisory group, recommends voting for unification.

The British government has also cheered the plan. Dutch politicians are less enthusiastic.

In 2018, Prime Minister Mark Rutte tried unsuccessfully to scrap the 15% tax on dividends. The cut was intended to keep Unilever and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) in the Netherlands, but became seen as a gift to rich foreign investors.

Dutch politicians also do not want their country missing out on collecting some 300 million euros ($355 million) annual tax from Unilever, leading an opposition party to propose an ""Exit Tax"".

Unilever says that idea violates European law, but if enacted as proposed, it would cost the company 11 billion euros -- enough to derail unification once again.

""If it doesn't happen, the last hundred years or so suggests that Unilever will continue to thrive, all around the globe,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown's Clayton.

Investing.com -- Crude oil prices fell to three-month lows in early trading on Friday in New York, spooked by signs of a growing imbalance between supply and demand as the world economy struggles to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity.

By 9:10 AM ET (1310 GMT), futures were down 1.3% at $36.81 a barrel, on course for a loss of over 7% for the week. It’ll be the first time since the depths of the pandemic’s first wave in March that prices have fallen for two weeks in a row.

The international benchmark was down 1.2% at $39.57, in a clear breach of the $40 level that has been the lower end of its trading range all through the summer.

“This price drop is a bearish correction that has been on the making for a while,” said Rystad Energy analyst Paola Rodriguez-Masiu in e-mailed comments. “The market had been too optimistic on draws and demand recovery expectations.”

The latest leg down comes in the wake of confirmation from the U.S. government that crude stockpiles snapped a streak of six straight weekly declines. Inventories rose 2.03 million barrels last week, in contrast to expectations of a draw of 1.34 million barrels.

More worryingly, the Energy Information Administration’s report showed U.S. supplies of refined products to the domestic market were down 11% last week from their average of the last five years.

The mood has further darkened on Friday against a backdrop of fresh anecdotal evidence of looming oversupply.

By Rod Nickel

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - A wave of consolidation is underway in Canada's Montney oil and gas region as small companies struggling to weather the impact of coronavirus on the energy industry sell their holdings in what just a few years ago was a booming patch.

Lockdowns and sharp contractions in economic activity have hammered global oil demand in 2020, pushing prices so low that producers worldwide have made record output and spending cuts.

Canada, the world's fourth-largest oil and gas producer, was already struggling as investors and foreign companies left to invest in production elsewhere that is cheaper and less carbon-intensive.

The Montney, which straddles Alberta and British Columbia, has seen at least nine significant deals worth some C$2.3 billion (1.36 billion pounds)in the past year.

It produces 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 45% of Western Canada's gas supply, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The firm expects the Montney's gas production to grow to 57% of Western Canadian output by 2025 and 65% by 2030.

As smaller companies leave, assets in the Montney are being concentrated in the hands of large oil firms.

Two of the largest deals were Canadian Natural Resources Limited's (TO: ) purchase of Painted Pony Energy (TO: ) in August, and an acquisition of assets by U.S. major ConocoPhillips (N: ) from Kelt Exploration (TO: ).

""It's been six years since the downturn (started) and some guys are saying 'enough is enough,'"" said Jeremy McCrea, analyst at Raymond James, referring to smaller names looking to sell. He expects more deals into 2021.

Eighteen Canadian companies tracked by Wood Mackenzie saw the amount of their loans based on the value of reserves reduced by some C$1.8 billion, or 22%, as of early August, said Mark Oberstoetter, director of upstream Canadian research at the consultancy. Reserve-based loans allow companies to borrow based on how much their future oil and gas production prospects are worth.

As oil prices have fallen, the value of reserves has tumbled with them, reducing credit available to energy companies.

Smaller producers may have been willing to persevere through losses, but ""banks and financial backers are now calling the shots,"" Oberstoetter said.

Natural gas prices have rebounded from rock-bottom levels, boosting interest among larger companies. Gas stored in Alberta was recently trading around C$2.31 per gigajoule, up 10% year to date.

Consolidation may be limited, however, because there are few potential buyers with the balance sheets and access to capital to make deals, Oberstoetter said. U.S. shale, where companies are struggling due to overpriced deals they made during better times, is struggling with the same issue.

Advantage Oil and Gas (TO: ), one of the Montney's earliest gas drillers, would be open to combining with others, Chief Executive Andy Mah said. His company sold a stake in its Glacier gas plant in July for C$100 million to raise cash.

""If there's an opportunity where something bigger can be done, I don't think we would shy away,"" he said.

Tourmaline Oil Corp (TO: ), which bought two Montney producers and land in February, Canadian Natural and ARC Resources (TO: ) are three companies that could make further buys, Cormark Securities said.

Ovintiv Inc's (N: ) Montney focus is on producing more condensate, the light oil blended with heavy crude for transport, said Brendan McCracken, executive vice-president of corporate development at the Colorado-based company, one of the play's biggest gas producers. Canada imports much of its condensate from the United States.

Analysts believe gas provides much of the Montney's current upside after several years of low prices. Natural gas supplies look tight for the peak winter season, improving the price outlook, according to CIBC, because producers shut in gas produced as a byproduct of oil production.

Construction also continues on Royal Dutch Shell-led (L: ) LNG Canada, a liquefied export terminal on the Pacific Coast planned for the mid-2020s that has not yet secured all of its gas supplies, according to TD Securities.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/enough-is-enough-canadas-montney-producers-swap-oil-and-gas-assets-for-cash-2209142,0.048,0.871,0.081,0.9637

(Bloomberg) -- Even the cleanest fossil fuel is losing its appeal to rich nations.

Just a few years ago, was hailed as vital for the transition toward an economy that runs on renewable energy. But sentiment is changing and the fuel is going the same way as coal, its dirtier sibling shunned by governments, utilities and investors.

The cancellation of the giant Atlantic Coast pipeline in the U.S. and Ireland’s decision to scrap backing for an import terminal this summer are the latest signs that gas is falling out of favor with everyone from regulators to asset managers.

As countries intensify efforts to meet climate obligations, the fuel used for heating, cooking and power production is poised to lose out to solar, wind and private and public energy efficiency measures.

While natural gas only emits about half the carbon dioxide of coal, flaring and methane leaks have tarnished its reputation across the globe, according to Nick Stansbury, head of commodity research at Legal & General Investment Management Ltd. in London. Many investors are also shying away to instead allocate funds to projects aligned with objectives of the Paris Agreement, he said.

“Gas companies have underestimated that the public opinion is changing rapidly,” said Stansbury. “Coronavirus lockdowns have had a role in that change, as investors are also stepping back and rethinking how things should be done.”

More than 1,200 institutions managing over $14 trillion in assets have committed to divest from fossil fuels, up from 181 managing $50 billion five years ago, according to a report from Fossil Free, an international environmental movement.

In the U.S., environmental opposition helped boost the costs for the Atlantic Coast pipeline to almost double to $8 billion. This year, about $10 billion of gas pipeline projects in the U.S. got scrapped — even as gas enjoys political support from President Donald Trump’s administration.

European politicians are now debating whether to pursue the giant Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany -- not for environmental reasons but thorny geopolitical ones. That debate also raises the question of whether the pipeline would be going ahead anyway if so many billions hadn’t already been invested.

While in the rich world activists and investors are using their successful anti-coal playbook against gas, it's a different picture in the developing world.

Surging economies and urbanization is driving demand for both coal and natural gas. The biggest energy companies are spending billions on gas exploration and infrastructure as new markets open up.

“We will have a stronger growth in liquefied natural gas than in any aspect of the energy system,” Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc’s Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden told reporters on July 30.

The increase will be helped by a plunge in prices after the worst glut the world has ever seen. Nations from Vietnam to Brazil plan to use the fuel to feed power hungry citizens and wean themselves off coal.

Vietnam’s shift to gas and renewables has been the most drastic in Southeast Asia, said Daine Loh, an analyst at Fitch Solutions. Roughly 26 gigawatts of gas-fired power projects are planned by 2029, according to Fitch. That’s enough to meet 8% of the nation’s current power demand.

Total SA’s Mozambique LNG project has completed as much as $16 billion in funding in the biggest foreign direct investment in the continent yet. Brazil’s economy minister Paulo Guedes said that “a shock of cheap energy” is essential after this year breaking up a monopoly that will increase demand from factories and in transportation.

Demand will rise in Asia, Africa and Middle East over the next five years, while remaining stable in Europe, Eurasia and North America. according to the International Energy Agency.

Back in Europe, governments embarking on post Covid-19 recovery paths are even more focused on greening their economies. European leaders approved the most ambitious climate change plan to date, with more than 500 billion euros ($572 billion) to be poured into green projects.

That’s bad news for projects like the Shannon LNG import terminal in Ireland, developed by US-based New Fortress Energy (NASDAQ: ). The nation’s new coalition government on June 30 decided to withdraw it from the Projects of Common Interest list in 2021 that sets out which projects should receive incentives from the European Union.

The facility would be built on land once owned by the grandmother of computer programmer John McElligott. He has been fighting for the project for 14 years. “Ireland’s decision to not support Shannon is massive,” he said.

While Fortress hasn’t given up on its plans, the list of white elephants is growing.

A judge last year decided that an LNG terminal in Gothenburg on Sweden’s west coast shouldn’t be connected to the grid. Construction on a pipeline between France and Spain was abandoned after regulators on both sides of the border used vetoes to stop it.

The backlash against gas is even burgeoning in Australia, one of the world’s top LNG exporters. While activists in the country have traditionally opposed resource developments mainly because of local ecological impacts, resistance to new gas projects worth more than A$50 billion is increasingly focused on how they’re incompatible with the country’s climate commitments under the Paris accord.

Nicholas DeIuliis, CEO at CNX Resources (NYSE: ) Corp., a gas producer in the heart of the American shale gas boom in Appalachia sums it up: “The intensity and the urgency has shifted for those in opposition to natural gas.”

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The economic trauma caused by the coronavirus pandemic persuaded energy companies to step-up investments in renewables, hydrogen and other low carbon alternatives, but fossil fuels will remain dominant for the foreseeable future, industry executives said.

Reeling from the onset of the pandemic, global oil consumption shrank by more than 20% in the second quarter and prices hit their lowest in decades, making companies rethink how fast they should make the transition away from reliance on oil and gas.

""Everyone's talking about this great reset ... What do we need to do to survive this?"" Arif Mahmood, Petronas' executive vice president and CEO of downstream, said at the virtual Platts APPEC 2020.

""Energy transition will be pushed forward much faster,"" he concluded.

The Malaysian state energy company posted a $5 billion (3.89 billion pounds) loss in April-June and has set up a team to reshape its portfolio and expand in solar and wind for power generation.

Oil majors such as BP (L: ) have set ambitious targets while Chinese state energy companies tiptoed into renewables.

Felipe Bayon, chief executive of Colombia's Ecopetrol, said the company wants to go from zero to 300 megawatts (MW) in renewable power generation by 2022 for its own use.

Besides expanding into solar and wind for power generation, more energy companies are researching blue hydrogen produced from and using carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce emissions in the process. The hydrogen could be used in power plants and fuel cell vehicles.

Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) is involved in biomethane, biofuels and hydrogen and has done ""significant work"" on CCS as the energy major strikes a balance between energy transition and its core hydrocarbons business, Mark Quartermain, Shell's vice president of crude trading & supply, told the conference.

""We understand that energy transition is coming. We still see, of course, a huge future in our hydrocarbon business, but when it comes to energy transition we need to be in these markets,"" he said.

Heads of research at commodity trader Vitol and Citigroup (NYSE: ) expect CCS to be the next key area of development.

""Hydrogen and carbon capture are more likely in short term to be contributing to decarbonization,"" Giovanni Serio, Vitol's global head of research, said, calling on the industry to invest more in CCS.

""Some countries are finding ways through credit systems and other mechanisms to price carbons...It's what's really needed for carbon capture to take off,"" Ed Morse, managing director and global head of commodities research at Citigroup said.

However, ""the cost structure of hydrogen is just not competitive enough...it's there but it could be end of the decade phenomenon,"" Morse said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/pandemics-great-reset-makes-energy-firms-invest-more-in-renewables--executives-2211194,0.037,0.873,0.09,0.9794

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) began shutting some of its offshore drilling operations on Sunday in preparation for Tropical Storm Sally, forecast to become a hurricane before making landfall on Tuesday, the company said.

Shell's offshore production was unchanged and all personnel remained on production platforms, company spokeswoman Cynthia Babski said.

Energy producers and communities along the U.S. Gulf Coast organized evacuations of residents and offshore workers on Sunday as they prepared for the second hurricane strike in less than a month.

However, one firm, BHP (AX: ) does not plan to take workers from offshore facilities, a company spokeswoman said on Sunday.

Tropical Storm Sally strengthened as it crept up the warm waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on Sunday, carrying winds that could reach 90 miles per hour (145 kph) ahead of landfall on Tuesday, forecasters said.

It was about 280 miles (450 km) east-southeast from the mouth of the Mississippi River and moving at 13 mph, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), its sustained winds had increased to 60 mph (95 kph), the NHC said.

Chevron Corp. (N: ) and Murphy Oil Corp (N: ) on Saturday began evacuations from offshore production platforms, spokespeople said. Chevron's Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery was implementing storm preparedness procedures, the company said.

Other oil producers with drilling rigs and platforms in the area said they were monitoring the storm and prepared to take action as needed.

U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore oil production provides about 17% of oil and 5% of U.S. production. As much as 1.5 million barrels per day of oil output was shut last month as Hurricane Laura tore through the Gulf of Mexico.

Louisiana on Saturday declared a state of emergency and the city of New Orleans ordered a Sunday 6 p.m. CDT evacuation for residents outside the city's protective levees. Coastal Grand Isle also issued its third evacuation since July.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/shell-halts-offshore-drilling-as-us-gulf-coast-braces-for-hurricane-2209994,0.011,0.945,0.044,0.8658

(Reuters) - London's slipped on Thursday as focus turned to emergency Brexit talks over Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to undercut parts of the divorce treaty, while Morrisons tumbled after reporting a drop in half-year profit.

The supermarket group fell 4.3% even as it said it expected profit growth for the full year, taking the FTSE 100 down 0.7%. BP (LON: ) Plc and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc also weighed on the index following a slide in oil prices.

""Markets are moving with heavy caution and we also see investors pulling back on some export-heavy names until they see concrete developments on the Brexit front,"" said Ronald Kaloyan, head of European equity strategy at SocGen.

The FTSE 100 has been lifted this week by a weaker pound as Brexit fears returned to the forefront with negotiations all but stalling over fisheries and state aid. A recent Reuters poll found chances of the two sides failing to reach a trade deal have jumped to 40%.

Sources said on Thursday the European Union could take legal action if emergency talks do not reassure Brussels sufficiently that a proposed new British law will not break previously agreed commitments.

The mid-cap , considered a barometer of Brexit sentiment, was flat with a slide in banks offsetting a 4.5% jump in retailer Dixons Carphone (LON: ) Plc following an upbeat earnings report.

The domestically-focussed index has underperformed the FTSE 100 this month as surging COVID-19 cases have sparked a new round of lockdowns in England, threatening a nascent business recovery and hitting shares of restaurant and pub firms.

Homebuilders were among the smallest decliners on the day after data showed house prices hit a four-yeah high in August, although the survey also sent a warning signal that the recovery could run out of steam.

LONDON (Reuters) - Achieving net zero emissions by mid-century would cost an estimated $1 trillion-$2 trillion (774.83 billion pounds-1.55 trillion pounds) a year of additional investments, or 1-1.5% of global gross domestic product, a report by the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) said on Wednesday.

To limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century, global greenhouse gas emissions will need to reach net zero.

When this is achieved, the reduction in 2050 living standards in developed and developing countries would amount to less than 0.5% of global GDP, the report said.

The ETC is a global coalition of 40 energy producers, industrial companies and financial institutions, including ArcelorMittal (LU: ), HSBC, BP (L: ), Shell (L: ), Orsted (CO: ) and Bank of America (N: ), which are committed to achieving a carbon-free economy by 2050.

The report said dramatic improvements in energy efficiency will need to be made; annual global electricity supply will have to grow four to five times to reach 90,000-115,000 terawatt hours and the annual pace of wind and solar capacity will need to be five to six times the increase achieved in 2019.

In addition, buildings, transport and industry sectors need to be electrified and hydrogen should be used in cases where that is not possible. Any remaining energy use should be decarbonised using carbon capture and storage and sustainable bioenergy.

""There is no doubt that it is technically and economically possible to reach the zero-carbon economy which we need by 2050; and zero must mean zero, not a plan which relies on the permanent and large-scale use of 'offsets' to balance continued emissions,"" said co-chair of the ETC, Adair Turner.

""But action in the next decade is crucial – otherwise it will be too late,"" he added.

China has the resources and technology to become a rich, developed carbon-free economy by 2050. All developing nations should be able to reach net-zero emissions by 2060 at the latest but will require development investment to attract private green investors, the ETC said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/global-net-zero-emissions-goal-would-require-12-trillion-a-year-investment--study-2212309,0.014,0.92,0.067,0.9209

By Ron Bousso

LONDON (Reuters) - As major oil companies prepare to spend billions on renewable energy assets to stay relevant in a low-carbon future, the industry's patchy track record on takeovers is a red flag for some investors.

Ten years ago, the world's top energy companies were spending billions of dollars on major oil and gas assets and costly drilling programmes in remote parts of the world in a relentless drive to produce more.

Fast forward through an oil price crash in 2014 followed by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic this year and some big oil companies are counting the cost of the spending spree - as are their shareholders.

When Shell (L: ) bought BG Group for $54 billion in 2016 in the midst of the price crash, Chief Executive Ben van Beurden made a compelling case to investors: The deal would support Shell's dividend under almost any imaginable oil price scenario.

Four years later, with the world gripped by an unexpected global pandemic, the Anglo-Dutch company has slashed its dividend for the first time since the Second World War and suspended what was the world's biggest share buyback programme.

For investors, the deal crowned a decade of disappointing takeovers, from Exxon Mobil 's (N: ) $30 billion acquisition of North American producer XTO in 2009 to Repsol's (MC: ) $8.3 billion takeover of Canada's Talisman Energy just months before the 2014 crash to Occidental Petroleum's (N: ) ill-timed $38 billion bet on shale producer Anadarko last year.

Now, with European policymakers cracking down on greenhouse gas emissions, the region's major oil companies have promised to reinvent themselves as low-carbon power suppliers that would thrive in a world of clean energy.

To hit their goals in time, though, they will almost inevitably have to chase a relatively small pool of renewable energy assets in competition with big utility companies at a time valuations are going through the roof.

And some investors worry that history will repeat itself.

""The majors have been poor capital allocators for the better part of the past 20 years,"" said Chris Duncan, an analyst at Brandes Investment Partners which has shares in several European oil firms. ""I'm nervous ... usually when companies transition to a different market the transition is not a profitable process.""

BP (L: ) and Total (PA: ) will present details about their new strategies to investors this month. Repsol will hold its strategy day in November and Shell's will be in February. (Graphic: Big Oil's recent writedowns, https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-OILMAJORS/xklpyndebvg/chart.png)

'THE SAME MISTAKES'

The collapse in oil prices since COVID-19 struck has also forced the big companies to wipe billions of dollars off the value of their assets and it has also hit revenue to the point they've taken on more debt to keep up payments to shareholders.

Shell, for example, cut $16.8 billion off the value of its assets, which included a big chunk of the flagship QCLNG liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Australia it acquired through the BG deal.

All told, the world's top energy companies have booked asset writedowns totalling $60 billion this year following the slide in oil prices and demand during the coronavirus pandemic.

And since 2005, the combined debt of the top five global oil majors, which include Shell, BP and Total, has risen five fold to $370 billion. That means much of the cash they will generate in the coming years will probably go towards cutting debt. (Graphic: Big Oil's soaring debt, https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-OILMAJORS/gjnvwaxgevw/chart.png)

So oil companies chase renewable assets such as wind, solar and hydro, which generally have lower returns than oil and gas - or invest in green projects from scratch - they'll be starting from an already highly leveraged position.

Some analysts said that with record debts, an uncertain outlook for oil prices and a weak deal-making record, the big oil companies face a tough task getting investors on board.

""The European majors in particular will have to earn the right to invest more in renewables, and convince investors they will not make the same mistakes again, and again,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria.

""When Shell acquired BG Group, a key quote from Shell's CEO stuck with us: 'Bold, strategic moves shape our industry'. Unfortunately, many of the 'bold' moves from management teams in recent years have proven to destroy value over the long term for shareholders,"" he said.

Speaking in July, Shell's CEO stood by the deal.

""The company did get stronger, but indeed the company was not able to withstand the onslaught of COVID if we wanted to adopt a prudent stance ... I remain convinced it was the right move,"" van Beurden told reporters.

Three current and former BG and Shell executives interviewed by Reuters, however, believe the deal was overvalued even at the time due to bullish oil and gas price forecasts.

LOWER RETURNS

Big oil companies have historically attracted investors with a promise of large and steady dividends. But the sector has had a poor track record from shareholders' perspective of late.

Over the past five years, Shell's total shareholder returns stood at minus 2.9%, according to Refinitiv data.

The picture is similar for others including BP, Exxon Mobil and Total. In addition to Shell, BP and Norway's Equinor (OL: ), have also cut dividends and suspended share buybacks.

BP's total shareholder return, which assumes dividends are reinvested in its shares, is just 1.4% since 2015, while for Exxon it was minus 7.3%, the weakest in the sector, according to Refinitiv data.

Chevron (N: ) had the strongest total returns at 5.9%.

By comparison, returns from Apple (O: ) shares over the past five years are above 40% while Google's Alphabet (O: ) shares have returned more than 15%.

The steady drop in the value of oil companies - BP's market capitalisation has halved over the past two years to about $75 billion, for example – might also make it harder for them to land large acquisitions of renewable assets or power companies which have seen they shares surge in recent years.

Shares in Danish renewables power firm Orsted (CO: ), for example, have more than doubled over the past two years, giving it a market capitalisation of about $45 billion.

Shares in Spanish utility Iberdrola (MC: ), one of the world's biggest renewable power companies have jumped 180% in two years to give it a market value above $80 billion.

Valuations of companies such as Orsted could also rise further as many of Europe's top oil and gas companies compete amongst themselves to expand their low-carbon businesses fast.

Still, some investors said that as the European oil companies evolve into becoming low-carbon businesses, they might attract a different kind of investor more interested in long-term stability than bumper shareholder payouts year after year.

""Traditional oil and gas investors are fond of the high returns and, until recently, the outsized dividends associated with the sector."" said Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at The Scottish Investment Trust (LON: ).

""However, this shift may attract a different set of investors who look at the prospectively lower returns on offer from renewables with a less jaundiced eye.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel faced growing pressure on Thursday to reconsider the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will take gas from Russia to Germany, after she said Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Soviet-style nerve agent.

Merkel said on Wednesday that Navalny, who is being treated in a Berlin hospital, was the victim of a murder attempt using the nerve agent Novichok, and demanded an explanation by Russia.

Moscow has denied involvement in the incident and the Russian foreign ministry said Germany's assertion was not backed by evidence.

Western countries have condemned the attack on Navalny and many German politicians want a tough response.

""We must pursue hard politics, we must respond with the only language (Russian President Vladimir) Putin understands - that is gas sales,"" Norbert Roettgen, head of Germany's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told German radio.

""If the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is completed now, it would be the maximum confirmation and encouragement for Putin to continue this kind of politics,"" Roettgen, a member of Merkel's conservatives, told German television earlier.

Nord Stream 2 is set to double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline in carrying gas directly from Russia to Germany. Led by Russian company Gazprom (MCX: ) with Western partners, the project is more than 90% finished and due to operate from early 2021. This may complicate efforts to stop it.

The project has divided the European Union, with some countries warning it will undermine the traditional gas transit state, Ukraine, and increase the bloc’s reliance on Russia for energy supplies.

The United States, keen to increase shipments of liquefied (LNG) to Europe, also opposes the pipeline and has targeted some firms involved with sanctions.

Merkel has been unwavering in her commitment to the project which includes Uniper Wintershall DEA, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), Engie and OMV. She said last week that Navalny's case should not be linked to the pipeline. Many lawmakers in her party, which is close to business, still want it to be finished.

Former Social Democrat (SPD) Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a friend of Putin and lobbyist for Russian energy firms, has been involved with the pipeline and many in the SPD, which shares power with Merkel's conservatives, are also committed to it.

""If we want to send a clear message to Moscow with our partners, then economic relations must be on the agenda and that means the Nord Stream 2 project must not be left out,"" Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference and a former ambassador to Washington, said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/calls-mount-for-germany-to-rethink-nord-stream-2-pipeline-after-navalny-poisoning-2203470,0.071,0.849,0.08,0.3455

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Ill-timed bets on rising demand have Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ) facing a shortfall of about $48 billion through 2021, according to a Reuters tally and Wall Street estimates, a situation that will require the top U.S. oil company to make deep cuts to its staff and projects.

Wall Street investors are even starting to worry about the once-sacrosanct dividend at Exxon, which in the 20th Century became the world's most valuable company using global scale, relentless expansion and strict financial controls.

Exxon weathered a series of setbacks last decade and under Chief Executive Darren Woods sought to return to past prominence by big bets on U.S. shale oilfields, pipelines and global refining and plastics. It also bet big on offshore Guyana, where it discovered up to 8 billion barrels of oil, six years of production at its current rate.

But Exxon's ability to finance that global expansion is no longer assured. This year the company borrowed $23 billion to pay its bills, nearly doubling its outstanding debt. In July, it posted its first back-to-back quarterly losses ever. It faces a full-year $1.86 billion loss, according to Refinitiv, excluding asset sales or write downs.

The looming shortfall of about $48 billion through 2021 was calculated using cash from operations, commitments to shareholder payouts and costs for the massive expansion program Exxon had planned. Now the company is embarking on a worldwide review of where it can cut expenses, and analysts believe the once unthinkable dividend cut has grown more likely.

JOB REVIEWS, BENEFIT CUTS

This year's sharp drop in oil demand and pricing has shredded Woods' plan to spend at least $30 billion a year through 2025 to revive production and earnings by expanding in oil processing, chemicals and production, and by taking a commanding role in U.S. shale and liquefied , markets that then looked promising.

Instead, he must prepare Exxon to operate in a world of weaker demand for its oil, gas and plastics. The company has been dropped from the of top U.S. industrial companies after 92 years. It is exposing up to 10% of U.S. staff to harsh reviews that could push thousands out of the company, and is taking away lavish retirement benefits that had career employees staying 30 years on average.

Exxon declined to make an executive available for an interview, and a spokesman said details of cost cuts would be disclosed early next year.

""We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities – investing in industry advantaged projects, paying a reliable and growing dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet,"" said spokesman Casey Norton.

A review of projects now underway aims to ""maximize efficiency and capture additional cost savings to put us in the strongest position"" as energy markets improve, he said.

Oil ( ) prices have dropped 35% from the start of 2020 as demand collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic. BP (LON: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), Total and Repsol (MC: ) and others have cut billions of dollars off the value of their oil and gas properties, something Exxon has yet to do.

The European majors also are adding renewable energy and electricity to their portfolios, a hedge against permanently reduced oil and gas demand. BP plans by 2030 to reduce its fossil fuel production by 40%. It plans to sell even more fossil fuel properties if oil prices have a sustained rally.

DEBT NEARLY DOUBLES

Exxon's cash from operations - estimated to be about $17.4 billion this year - is $20 billion below the funds needed for this year's already pared investment plan and shareholder dividend, a Reuters analysis showed.

The company's stock price closed Friday at $39.08, off 56% since Woods became CEO. He raised $23.19 billion in new debt this year to bolster finances, but has vowed not to borrow more and as recently as July insisted the dividend was sacrosanct.

Investors say the commitments will be difficult to keep. ""At $41 or $42 [per barrel] crude, you can't put those puzzle pieces together and have them make sense,"" said Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, which holds about $70 million in Exxon shares.

Exxon must cut its dividend if the share price remains depressed, Stoeckle said. ""Something has to give. Wherever the give comes hurts management credibility,"" he said.

A cut would be ""cataclysmic"" for Exxon's stock, said equity analyst Paul Sankey of Sankey Research, given that executives in July reiterated its importance.

Exxon's weak cash flow worries investors that hold the stock for its nearly 9% dividend. Matrix Asset Advisors has it on a ""watch list in terms of our conviction and their ability to defend and grow the dividend,"" said David Katz, chief investment officer at the New York firm.

SPENDING CUTS AND DEFERRALS

Exxon will slash spending in the Permian Basin shale field this year to about $3 billion from an original $7.4 billion budget, consultancy Rystad Energy estimates.

The company has said it plans to reduce the number of drilling rigs there to 15 or fewer, from 55 early this year, and the company's pullback ""will continue,"" senior vice president Neil Chapman said in a July call. Spending on refining and chemicals plants that take years to design and complete, ""is really a question of deferral,"" he added.

A $10 billion chemical plant in China remains subject to permits, the Exxon spokesman said. Spending limits will further constrain its oil, refining and plastics businesses and could revive pressure on the company to divest some operations.

""Each of our core businesses could be a powerhouse in its own right,"" Woods said when he rolled out the vision in early 2017. At the time, he was pushing back at calls to spin off businesses to boost lagging returns.

Woods stuck to the growth targets last year, putting this year's potential earnings at $25.1 billion with oil at $60 a barrel and assuming flat refining and chemical margins. That forecast included 2020 cash flow and asset sales targets that have become unreachable since the pandemic hit.

(For a graphic of Exxon's capital and exploration spending, go here: https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-OIL/EXXON/dgkpllkkqpb/chart.png)

Analysts said that Woods must dial back. Project outlays next year could drop to between $10.4 billion and $15 billion, according to ScotiaBank and RBC Capital Markets, half the original outlook.

NO URGENCY FOR LNG

Some project schedules are being quietly stretched to save costs.

Construction at a $10 billion-plus LNG facility in Texas where Exxon holds a 30% stake already was moving slowly and now ""there isn't the urgency,"" said Alex Munton, with consulting and data firm Wood Mackenzie. He expects its startup will be delayed a year, to 2025 at the earliest.

A massive LNG project in Mozambique likely will not get a final investment decision until 2023, as an expansion of Exxon LNG exports in Papua, New Guinea, is delayed by government talks and low LNG prices, Munton said.

""The reality is that Exxon is not moving forward with either of those in the near term,"" Munton said.

In Mexico, Exxon will likely reduce offshore activity after its first well was not commercial, according to people familiar with its operations. It will instead focus on fuel imports and retail sales, they said.

Exxon has begun exploration drilling in Brazil, where the company returned in 2017 to become second only to state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA in holdings of offshore exploration acreage. But ""spend and activity deferrals cannot be ruled out as part of any cost-cutting,"" said Ruaraidh Montgomery, director at Welligence Energy Analytics.

Other projects already begun, including the $1.9 billion expansion of its Beaumont, Texas, refinery, face an up to one year postponement.

Exxon declined to comment on the LNG, Mexico or Brazil spending.

Other than Guyana, ""there will be no other sacred cow in the near-term budget,"" said analyst Paul Cheng of ScotiaBank.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/exclusive-exxon-downsizes-global-empire-as-wall-street-worries-about-dividend-2205835,0.083,0.829,0.087,0.8073

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - No new liquefied (LNG) export projects could be approved this year for the first time in at least two decades, banking and industry sources said, after the COVID-19 pandemic drove down energy demand and knocked prices to all-time lows.

In a stark contrast to last year's record level of approvals for LNG production plants, 2020's dramatic oil and gas price drop has forced companies to delay decisions on new projects and write down investments in existing plants.

The last year in which no new LNG exports plants were approved was 1998, consultancy Wood Mackenzie told Reuters, while the International Energy Agency estimated it was at least two decades ago.

Five investment banking and energy analysts said they expect no final investment decisions (FIDs) this year, while four other sources said they expect at most one to two.

Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the volume of new export capacity sanctioned in 2020 was expected to be similar to last year's record of over 70 million tonnes per year.

""We do not expect any major FIDs on LNG export projects this year,"" Morgan Stanley (NYSE: )'s lead commodity strategist for natural gas and power Devin McDermott said.

""With coronavirus reducing oil demand and prices, majors' capital spending dropped, weighing on their investment and pushing out FIDs.""

Giovanni Bruni and Alessandro Agosta, partners at McKinsey & Company, said they expect all pre-FID projects to be delayed by 1 to 2 years due to CAPEX cuts and deferrals, plus difficulty in securing buyers.

NORTH AMERICAN PROJECTS IN LIMBO

Most industry sources and analysts said the only project with a chance of receiving an FID this year is the Costa Azul export plant in Mexico, developed by U.S.-based Sempra Energy (NYSE: ).

The outlook elsewhere in North America is much darker.

A record flow of investments in new projects last year by majors or companies with big LNG portfolios disadvantaged those proposed by smaller companies, which need contracts with buyers before being sanctioned.

In mid-2019 about a dozen North American developers said they planned to make FIDs by the end of the year, but none of those projects are under construction.

At the start of 2020 a similar number, including some whose plans were delayed from last year, said they intended to make FIDs by the end of this year.

However that had been reduced to four by this summer - Sempra's Costa Azul, Venture Global's Plaquemines Parish, Annova's Brownsville and Delfin Midstream's Delfin Gulf of Mexico project.

In the United States, there may be no room for new projects until the middle of the decade after record new capacity was added last year, with a delay in investments helping the market balance, analysts say.

Over 21 million tonnes per year of new U.S. LNG capacity came onstream in 2019 and more than 16 million tonnes this year, contributing heavily to a global gas glut.

But most U.S. developers hope that will start to shrink next year as the demand drag from coronavirus lockdowns lifts.

An FID for the Delfin project is now planned for 2021, Delfin Midstream Chief Executive Dudley Poston told Reuters.

He said the company is engaged with multiple buyers on flexible contracts for 10 to 25 years and that it needs to sell approximately 2.5 million metric tons of LNG per annum (mmtpa) to make an approval.

Officials at Venture Global had no comment on whether they still planned to make an FID on Plaquemines Parish this year, while Annova said on its website it currently plans to commence construction at Brownsville in 2021.

MAJORS TO PROFIT

While smaller companies may find it hard to navigate the current buyers' market, the delay in investment is positive for companies with large LNG portfolios, such as oil majors, analysts said.

Bernstein senior oil & gas analyst Oswald Clint said delays could last for another 12 to 18 months, helping create higher prices by 2025. That could mean bigger profits for oil majors.

Companies with substantial portfolios are expected to be the first to return with FIDs, with low prices expected to create additional demand.

""If you are a big major you are concerned about the commodity price, not its volume. You have to not invest money in 2020 to protect your balance sheet,"" Clint said.

Initially intending to take an FID this year on the 16.45 million tonne per year Lake Charles project in the United States, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) has exited the venture and written down billions of dollars from its oil-linked LNG projects in Australia.

Analysts said the Lake Charles exit was a direct result of COVID-19's impact on demand and prices, while the write-down on the Australian assets showed a change in majors' attitude to spending on LNG.

However, it was not a sign of long-term weakness of the market, they said.

""Our longer term outlook for increased LNG demand has not changed,"" Anatol Feygin, executive vice president and CEO of U.S. major LNG producer Cheniere said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/coronavirus/lng-investments-vanish-in-2020-as-coronavirus-slashes-oil-and-gas-prices-2206346,0.054,0.87,0.076,0.9823

MEXICO CITY/LONDON (Reuters) - At a time when oil production is at historic lows, lenders who want Mexican oil giant Pemex to adapt to climate change are struggling to be heard.

Big oil companies such as BP (L: ), Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Repsol (MC: ) have begun to build strategies to cut the carbon they emit. But state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], one of the biggest borrowers in emerging markets, is determined to push in the opposite direction, three people in the company and in the government told Reuters.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist oil nationalist, has staked his reputation on reviving Pemex, which has been a powerful symbol of Mexican self-reliance since its creation in 1938 but is now heavily indebted. Earlier this year, Pemex became history's largest ""fallen angel"" - a borrower that descends from investment grade to junk.

Lopez Obrador has said rehabilitating the country's six outdated oil refineries and building a seventh one in his home state, Tabasco, is key. He considers the new refinery a milestone towards energy independence, one top source in the finance ministry said, adding that this concern has become more pressing in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's power to stifle Mexico's economy. Lopez Obrador is determined to keep Pemex focused on exploration for oil, the sources said.

Pemex, which employs nearly 150,600 workers and is the source of almost a fifth of Mexico's budget revenues, is set to be a critical test case for both institutional investors and climate change campaigners looking to push through change.

If its management does not heed calls to curb carbon emissions, ""it will become tougher for them to issue debt,"" said Marie-Sybille Connan, an analyst at asset manager Allianz (DE: ) Global Investors.

Investors have rarely spoken about their engagement with Pemex management, but Allianz is one of four major lenders who are now going public. Nearly 90% of the oil company's $107.2 billion total financial debt is held by bond investors, Refinitiv Eikon data, quarterly reports and filings related to recent refinancing transactions show. On top of this, it has $64.9 billion in pension liabilities.

""It will become increasingly challenging for international institutional investors to invest in their bond issuances if they don't address their sustainability concerns - whether climate, oil spills due to oil theft and health and safety,"" Connan said.

The biggest challenge for both Mexico and Pemex is the fact that there are other things that take priority, said Aaron Gifford, emerging market debt analyst at T.Rowe Price, one of the largest holders of Pemex bonds. After the taxes the company pays to the government, there's no money left to invest in new ways to produce oil.

""We've been very keen on speaking to Pemex's board and really trying to get them to commit to making changes for good,"" said Gifford. But management has canceled a lot of investor meetings and calls.

""Those meetings that I've been in, they've been very tense and sometimes even a little bit heated,"" he said. ""We have so many questions for them.""

Pemex, the Mexican finance ministry and the president's office did not respond to requests for comment. Lopez Obrador, who has pointed to Mexico's state-run hydroelectric plants to show he backs renewable energy, has blamed his predecessors for Pemex's problems. Financial debt surged by 75% under the last government, a Reuters analysis of accounts from the past decade shows.

CREDIT CRUNCH

On paper, Pemex is barely solvent. Its liabilities exceed its assets by more than $110 billion, its accounts show. The reason international investors keep lending is because the market considers the Mexican government has given an implicit guarantee for Pemex.

This support was reiterated in April, after Pemex's bonds were downgraded. ""Now, more than ever before, Petroleos Mexicanos has the absolute backing of the federal government,"" company executives said in a letter on government-headed notepaper to investors, seen by Reuters.

Market pressure is already building. The company's yield spreads have widened, showing it is already getting harder to borrow as even yield-hungry investors are rethinking their investments. Yields on Pemex bonds are between about 7% and just under 9% for the most frequently traded ones as of Aug. 28, according to MarketAxess data.

Investors such as Allianz said that even if Pemex has pressing problems now, it shouldn't ignore long-term objectives. None expect radical change, but the four who spoke to Reuters said they feel the company is not taking their concerns seriously.

If international investors become reluctant to lend, Mexico's own access to credit could also be at stake. Ratings agencies have repeatedly cited the company's unsustainable debt level as a risk factor for the sovereign rating. Mexico's sovereign bonds are skirting the edge of a downgrade.

Climate Action 100+, a group of 450 asset managers with collective assets of some $40 trillion, told Reuters earlier this month it would add Pemex to the list of 160 companies it seeks to speak to directly to prompt them to develop strategies for a lower carbon future.

""When we look at what peers are doing, Pemex should do more, show more ambition in terms of commitment to reduce carbon emissions,"" said Jaime Gornsztejn, who leads the engagement with Latin American companies for Federated Hermes, a fund manager which is spearheading that effort.

He and others said companies such as Colombia's Ecopetrol (CN: ) and Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras (SA: ), have gone further than Pemex to address climate concerns.

""We haven't had much traction so far,"" he said.

Pemex's credit options are constrained by Mexico's proximity to the United States. Even if other countries were hypothetically open to lending to the company, Jorge Sanchez, director at Mexican financial think tank Fundef, said it was unlikely Mexico would turn to them.

""It's not about Pemex, it's about geopolitics,"" Sanchez said. ""The United States won't be happy if the main investors in Pemex, Mexico's largest company, were Chinese or Russian.""

PRESSURE

Pemex was the ninth biggest energy producer of carbon and methane emissions globally between 1965 and 2018, according to data from the Climate Accountability Institute, an NGO, with emissions of some 23 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

That is less than the largest state-owned emitters, Saudi Aramco (SE: ) and the National Iranian Oil Company, but more than any other Latin American oil company, the data showed.

Even so, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters the company has no plans to change its strategy.

Lopez Obrador's energy agenda rolls back some of the moves made by his predecessor to open the energy market to the private sector. Next year's budget will likely be dedicated to boosting oil extracted from shallow waters, one senior Pemex executive with direct knowledge of the draft proposal said, adding there was no allocation for greener policies.

While the President says he is committed to clean energy, he has justified government efforts to impede the roll-out of new privately built solar and wind capacity on the grounds that those plants were tainted by corruption in past administrations. ""(Renewable energy) was used as a pretext for doing lucrative business ... to get government subsidies, to push up the price of electricity and affect us all,"" he said in July.He has also complained that wind farms are an eyesore.

""There's no way the government will consider another scenario for its energy policy,"" a person at the oil company's commercial arm PMI said, on condition of anonymity. ""What they're looking for is becoming a big player in exploration, production and refining.""

The kind of oil Pemex mostly produces, known as ""heavy sour crude,"" has fallen out of favor over environmental concerns because refining it tends to produce highly polluting sulfur-rich fuel oil.

Last December, Mexico's energy regulatory commission agreed that the government could postpone a planned rule that would have required Pemex to produce and sell only ultra-low sulfur diesel across the country.

Pemex had asked the courts to give it more time to comply with the rule, saying Mexico lacked the infrastructure to comply.",https://uk.investing.com//news/economic-indicators/mexicos-pemex-tests-limits-of-investor-influence-on-climate-change-2200709,0.061,0.853,0.086,0.989

A lot of people spend their time worrying about the State Pension, but don’t do anything about it. Avoid falling into that trap. Instead, look to build the money you need to enjoy a comfortable retirement, by investing in UK shares.

Nobody makes a fortune on the stock market overnight, despite what many people think. It takes time and effort. So if you have money to spare, don’t leave it any longer.

Don’t worry about retirement, do something I would suggest backing up the State Pension by investing in the following two FTSE 100-listed investment trusts. These are companies whose business is managing a balanced portfolio of shares for income and growth.

The biggest and best known is Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (LSE: SMT), which now runs £14.3bn worth of assets. Over the last five years, it has smashed the and almost every other UK investment fund, with a total return of 300%.

It has largely done this by making a big call on the buoyant US stock market. More than half the fund is invested in the US, in big names such as Tesla, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Netflix (NASDAQ: ). As a result it has benefited from the tech boom.

It isn’t just a US fund, though. Roughly a fifth is invested in China, notably tech giants Tencent Holdings (HK: ) and Alibaba (NYSE: ) Group, and slightly less in Europe. If you mostly hold UK shares or funds, that could give you some much-needed diversification, away from your State Pension.

As with any fund, Scottish Mortgage may not always outperform. Also, it offers only a tiny dividend yield, just 0.34% a year.

Income on top of your State Pension If you want income, you could balance this with the UK’s second-biggest investment trust City of London Investment Trust (LSE: CTY). This equity income fund yields a whopping 5.86% a year, mostly from renowned FTSE 100 dividend-payers such as British American Tobacco (LON: ), Diageo (LON: ), Unilever (LON: ), GlaxoSmithKline, and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ). Scottish Mortgage gives you global growth, City of London gives you UK income.

If you invest a regular monthly sum in both, you should steadily build your wealth over time. When you retire, you could draw the natural yield from City of London to provide the income you need to top up your State Pension.

You can take lump sums from Scottish Mortgage, as and when. Remember, if you invest inside a Stocks and Shares ISA, both income and growth will be free of tax.

If you invest in these two funds, you can start building the wealth you need to reduce your reliance on the State Pension.

How you could make £1m from UK shares with £50 per week

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ULVR -0.47% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio MNDI +0.60% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SDR -0.08% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Building a million-pound portfolio of UK shares and retiring early may seem too good to be true. But I reckon it’s easier than you might think to hit this magic number, even with. fairly modest monthly investment.

In this piece I’ll explain how I’d use just £50 per week to build a stock portfolio that could support you comfortably for the rest of your life.

Here’s how I’d do it I’ll be honest. I’m not going to suggest investing in the latest hot pharma stocks or tech start-ups. My approach is based on building a portfolio of real businesses that generate profits and surplus cash.

Most of these businesses pay regular dividends which can also be reinvested to buy more shares. Over time, your annual returns get bigger and bigger. This effect is called compounding — it’s the secret to getting rich without needing a massive income.

The average long-term return from UK shares is around 8% per year. Based on a saving of £50 per week, here’s how I think your portfolio value could grow:

Portfolio value Time taken £100,000 17.5 years £500,000 34.9 years £1,000,000 43.3 years

Note how the growth speeds up. It takes 17 years to get to £100,000, but only 17 more years to get to £500,000 — another £400k. The final haul to £1m happens even faster, in just eight years. That’s the power of compounding. If you’re patient, you can get rich very easily.

If you’re 22 and you start saving today you could be a millionaire by the time you’re 65, before you hit State Pension age.

UK shares: here’s what I’d buy Where should you put your cash? It goes without saying that your UK shares should be inside a Stocks and Shares ISA. There’s no sense in paying tax on your investing profits when the government provides a tax-free option.

The simplest option is to invest the money in a cheap tracker fund. This approach has several advantages. It’s cheap, simple and you can invest as little as £25 without excessive fees.

However, the problem with owning the whole index is that it’s weighted towards low-growth businesses like big banks and oil companies.

My preferred approach is to build an evenly-diversified portfolio of the best companies in the index. Names I’d include on that list include consumer goods firm Unilever (LON: ), pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline and packaging group Mondi (LON: ). I’d also include some natural resources stocks — perhaps Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) — along with some good quality financials such as Schroder.

Most brokers offer regular investing services that allow you to buy smaller amounts of stock on fixed days without paying full dealing charges. I’d use services such as these to build a portfolio of 15-20 stocks. In my experience that’s enough to get a good balance between safety and performance.

Getting rich from UK shares isn’t difficult if you stick to the system and let compounding do the heavy lifting. This is how I hope to retire early — I believe it could work for you too.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.N. Special Envoy for Climate Action Mark Carney launched on Wednesday a private sector taskforce to scale up voluntary carbon credit markets, which he says are vital if countries and businesses are to meet emissions targets set under the Paris Climate Agreement.

Many global companies such as oil major Shell (L: ) and consumer goods giant Unilever (L: ) have pledged to reach net zero emissions but will need to buy or generate carbon credits to offset the emissions they are unable to cut from their operations.

""The financial sector can use their expertise in building market infrastructure to create a carbon offset market which connects this demand with supply,"" said Carney in a statement.

The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets will work to take stock of existing voluntary carbon markets and identify the key challenges to scaling these up.

It is made up of around 40 industry experts from companies such as Shell and BP (L: ), Tata Steel and airline Etihad and is being sponsored by global finance association the Institute of International Finance.

""By scaling voluntary carbon markets and allowing a global price for carbon to emerge, companies will have the right tools and incentives to reduce emissions at least cost,"" said Bill Winters, chair of the taskforce and Group Chief Executive of bank Standard Chartered (LON: ).

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Elon Musk appears to be opening a new front in the European battle for electric car supremacy: the power behind the wheel.

Musk's Tesla (O: ) has recently acquired a licence that will enable the carmaker to trade electricity across western Europe and the company has also been surveying customers in Germany about potentially using Tesla electricity in their cars.

Such moves, consultants and energy industry executives say, could set the stage for the company - possibly with one or more partners - to take on established utilities in Germany, Europe’s biggest power market and autos heartland.

Tesla declined to comment about its energy market plans.

Generating and trading power could help Tesla lower the running costs of its cars at a time rival automakers, including Germany's BMW (DE: ), Audi (DE: ), Porsche ( ) and Mercedes (DE: ), are churning out new electric models.

It could also step up competition to utilities such as Vattenfall ( ) and EnBW (DE: ), which are investing in electric mobility services too, but which like peers RWE (DE: ) and E.ON (DE: ) are lumbered with the cost of winding down fossil fuel and nuclear power plants.

Tesla already sells solar panels and the Powerwall battery storage system for homes, but now appears to be looking at selling electricity directly to customers and using the home storage systems to provide services to the grid.

In June, the company became a member of the Paris-based EPEX Spot power exchange, a platform used to trade much of western Europe's intraday cross-border electricity.

A month later, it surveyed German customers about their interest in energy services.

""What would encourage you to switch from your existing energy supplier?"", the survey said, according to a copy seen by Reuters.

""Would you buy a Tesla photovoltaic system and home storage (Tesla Powerwall) if you could switch to a specially designed Tesla electricity tariff?"", it added.

Tesla also asked potential energy customers whether they would allow the company to control when cars would charge.

This could allow it to coincide charging with cheap electricity rates during off peak hours, consultants and industry executives said.

It could also open the way for Tesla to use power stored by customers to help balance the electricity grid, an increasingly important service in Germany as it becomes ever more dependent on volatile wind and solar power.

Companies offering similar services in Germany include Shell-owned (L: ) sonnen, virtual power plant operator Next Kraftwerke, and power aggregator Lichtblick.

RENEWABLE ENERGY

Tesla's interest in renewable energy was one of the factors that led it to choose Brandenburg state around Berlin as the site for a new factory, a person familiar with the company's deliberations told Reuters.

In the first half of this year, some 65% of the electricity on the Brandenburg grid was generated from renewable sources, mostly wind. But like other areas in the north of the country, it often wastes energy because Germany's networks are limited in how much green power they can transport over long distances.

Tesla's Gigafactory 4 in Brandenburg will on its own require 100 megawatts (MW) of power and up to 400 MW if battery cell production is also launched, according to transmission grid operator 50Hertz.

Tesla is a long way from building up enough battery assets to deliver frequency regulation at grid scale, say specialists such as utility Axpo. But the company has made several steps to expand its energy activities in recent months.

In May, it applied for a UK licence to supply power, according to the Telegraph newspaper. It also uses a platform to bring users of its solar and Powerwall battery system into the electricity market in Australia.

""The next and obvious step for Tesla is to get into production, especially of renewable power,"" said consultant Berthold Hannes, who has 30 years of energy advisory experience.

""Tesla could use its own locations, for example the roofs of plants or the sites of charging points, and alternatively, or in addition, it could take stakes in solar plants or wind parks,"" he said.

Germany pioneered the solar power market, and is in the process of laying a policy framework that will make it easier for decentralised power generation and supply.

""Tesla's long-term plan definitely includes tackling the energy industry in a bigger way, though it's questionable whether it invests enough at the moment in that area,"" said a former member of Tesla management, who declined to be named.

Thomas Deser, a portfolio manager at Union Investment, said it was unlikely Tesla would enter the German electricity distribution business on its own - ""but it could do so with a competent partner from the energy industry.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/tesla-tests-the-circuits-for-german-energy-market-push-2202583,0.009,0.9,0.091,0.9968

These shares are still cheap after the stock market crash. Could they be profitable investments?

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LLOY -0.41% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio PSN +1.71% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio TW +1.14% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Even though the worst of the stock market crash seems a long while ago now, some shares are still struggling to recover. Some companies face major ongoing challenges, such as Cineworld, but others could bounce back strongly, especially if investors are patient.

Cheap after the stock market crash Lloyds Banking Group (LSE: LON: ) shares were hit hard by the pandemic. They haven’t really recovered. Fears over the economy, bad debts, and possibly also on the horizon Brexit once again coming to the fore, have all conspired to keep the share price suppressed.

Like other banks – all of which have also struggled – Lloyds has scrapped its dividend. I think this was a massive disappointment and one of the major reasons, pre-pandemic, for holding the shares.

Change is around the corner though. The CEO will be leaving next year after around a decade in charge. Over those 10 years, the share price has fallen, by roughly half. Even after the stock market crash, the overall is up over the last decade. Perhaps new management can inject some energy into the share price and build on the bank’s solid foundations.

I expect the Lloyds share price to remain in a fragile state as long as the economy does. However, when things improve, it could be a winner. I think the share price at that point could rise rapidly.

Cheap share that could reintroduce its dividend The same fears that have hit the share prices of banks have also hit housebuilders such as Taylor Wimpey (LSE: LON: ). Housebuilders also have specific challenges with the likely end of Help to Buy next year – unless the government extends the support.

Rival Persimmon (LON: ) has already reinstated its dividend. There’s no reason to think Taylor Wimpey will be far behind. Like my colleague recently pointed out, it’s better to buy the shares before the dividend is reintroduced. That way you can benefit from a boost in demand for the shares from income investors and from the improved sentiment towards the stock.

The pandemic will hit completions in the short term. But the group is raising money and buying land, which should boost future margins. The group has historically performed well and I believe it will emerge stronger from the pandemic.

A riskier cheap share I’m not a bull on oil but if you believe the oil price will keep bouncing back then Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) could be a very profitable investment. The decision to slash the dividend was unpopular with investors, but it does give management breathing room. That is important in a tricky operating environment like the current one.

The world is moving away from oil, and so is Shell to some degree, but for now the shares are much cheaper than they were and could be a profitable investment.

I think Lloyds and Taylor Wimpey especially are still very cheap following the stock market crash. I fully expect the share prices to bounce back and reward patient investors.

By Kate Abnett

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's long-awaited plan to curb emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane will not impose binding standards on sold in the bloc, according to a draft seen by Reuters.

Methane is nearly 90 times more potent than CO2 in its first 20 years in the atmosphere, and is emitted from leaky pipelines and infrastructure, and is often burned off at oil and gas fields. It is also produced in farming.

As the world's biggest importer of natural gas, the EU is facing pressure from investors, climate campaigners and some fossil fuel companies to set binding methane emissions limits on gas sold in Europe.

While the EU regulates methane emissions from gas burned in the bloc, it doesn't do so for emissions during the production or transport of gas imports, so those emissions don't show up in the tally of greenhouse gases linked to Europe's gas-fuelled power plants, nor are they are counted in the EU's climate goals.

The EU's methane strategy draft, due to be published by the European Commission next month, does not propose further methane emission standards but commits to ""explore"" them, without fixing a date.

Rather, it will propose legislation next year requiring oil and gas companies to better monitor and report methane emissions, and repair leaks.

The EU executive will then consider standards by 2025 to stop industry venting and flaring methane, practices that release the gas into the atmosphere or deliberately burn it.

VOLUNTARY TARGETS

Yet having the desired policy effect may prove difficult and there could be disagreements over any data used to analyse emissions. Much of the EU's gas comes from Russia, Norway and Algeria.

The Commission does not comment on unpublished drafts, which are subject to change until adopted.

Some fuel companies, including Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ), have already set voluntary targets to curb methane emissions.

However, campaigners say such efforts alone are insufficient, especially because recent satellite imagery and aerial surveillance have shown actual methane emissions significantly higher than levels reported by industry in some countries, including the United States.

""What we learnt from the U.S. is that voluntary agreements, data and transparency in and of themselves do not deliver reductions as needed,"" said Poppy Kalesi, global energy policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund.

(Bloomberg) -- The threat of a rare double storm blow looms for the U.S. Gulf Coast despite a weaker Tropical Storm Marco, with more than half of offshore oil production already shut and forecasts showing the potential for Laura to become a major hurricane before landfall Thursday.

Marco lost power as it approached Louisiana Monday, but is forecast to skirt the coastline before dying out later this week in Texas, said Don Keeney, a meteorologist with commercial forecaster Maxar. The worst of Marco will likely be confined to just along the shoreline and a little inland, while Laura could arrive Thursday as the Atlantic’s first major hurricane of 2020. The last time two storms plied the Gulf together was 1959.

“Laura is a different story,” Keeney said. “At this point it is expected to develop into a hurricane. Right now it is expected to be a strong Category 2 or weak Category 3.”

The double threat has already prompted evacuations of offshore energy platforms, and almost 58% of oil output and 45% of production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut, according to the Interior Department’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

Gulf Coast refineries and petrochemical plants are often located in low-lying areas vulnerable to flooding. In 2017, an Arkema SA (OTC: ) chemical plant about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Houston had a fire and explosion after it was flooded by Hurricane Harvey. In September, Exxon (NYSE: ) shut its Beaumont refinery in Texas because of flooding from Tropical Storm Imelda.

Laura almost certainly won’t be as damaging as Harvey, however. Harvey hit Texas as a Category 4 storm and then got pinned in place by larger weather patterns, causing it to send record rains across the eastern half of the state for days. Laura may pack a severe punch at landfall, but it will quickly exit the area, reducing the potential for lingering effects. The last hurricane to hit Texas was Hanna, just under a month ago.

Energy platforms in the Gulf of Mexico that account for as much as 17% of America’s oil production and about 3% of gas output are designed to withstand storms of this magnitude; they regularly shut and restart as systems pass through. But two hurricanes roiling the region in quick succession threaten to keep operations shut in for longer and cut into energy supplies more than usual.

Marco’s energy impact will be mainly confined to offshore installations, but Laura could cause problems for refineries and fuel-distribution hubs from Houston to Louisiana, said Jim Rouiller, lead meteorologist with the Energy Weather Group. Offshore platforms were retrofitted after 2005’s Hurricane Katrina to endure stronger storms, but onshore flooding could threaten the 45% of American fuel-making capacity that’s located along the Gulf Coast, as well as more than half the nation’s gas processing.

“The big issue is if it hits any of the refineries -- present track is right over Lake Charles and 10% capacity at risk,” said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. “A wobble puts the north Texas coast in play.”

Western sugarcane in Louisiana between Lake Charles and Lafayette will be the most at risk from Laura, said Drew Lerner, president of World Weather Inc. in Overland Park, Kansas. Things would be worse if the storm veers more to the east.

For cotton crops, some parts of western Mississippi Delta area, central and interior parts of Arkansas also could be impacted, he said.

Pipeline Shut

Energy Transfer (NYSE: ) LP shut in its Stingray Pipeline, which hauls gas from offshore fields to Louisiana, in anticipation of the storms. Ports in Louisiana are limiting operations or evacuating, and ship movements have been restricted in some areas. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, a major crude import hub, has suspended marine terminal operations.

Noble Corp (NYSE: ). is moving two offshore rigs, while BP (NYSE: ) Plc evacuated employees from four platforms and shut in some production. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc evacuated employees and idled output at the majority of its Gulf operations, according to a notice on its website.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, and Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves have all declared emergencies.

Thirteen Storms

Marco’s initial strike could make matters worse if Laura ends up in the same area. It could take several days for Marco’s coastal storm surge to subside, and if Laura strikes nearby it could push a wall of water into areas still inundated by Marco, said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist with Yale Climate Connections.

Even in its weakened state, Marco could push ocean levels up along Louisiana by as much as 4 feet above normal, the hurricane center said.

Due to a climate-change driven sea level rise, ocean levels in the Gulf are about 6 inches (15 centimeters) higher than they were when Katrina came ashore 15 years ago, FM Global, a commercial insurer, said in a notice to clients. The Gulf also is warmer than normal this year, which will fuel both storms as they near land.

Laura has already killed at least seven people in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the Associated Press reported.

Thirteen storms have now formed across the Atlantic this year, including five that hit the U.S. It is the fastest start to a hurricane season in records going back to 1851, said Phil Klotzbach, a storm researcher at Colorado State University.

(Bloomberg) -- Norwegian life insurer Storebrand ASA has beefed up its climate policy, leading it to exit oil giants Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ) and accelerate a full divestment from coal.

The move by the Oslo-listed company, which has about $91 billion under management, is another illustration of how investors are adjusting to the risks of climate change, putting pressure on fossil-fuel producers.

Storebrand has sold its holdings in Exxon and Chevron, chemicals giant BASF SE (OTC: ) and miner Rio Tinto (NYSE: ) Group for their lobbying efforts against the Paris Agreement and climate regulation, it said in a statement. It also quit ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ) and Husky Energy (OTC: ) Inc because of their investments in polluting oil sands.

The lobbying assessment is based on the companies’ official positions, the organizations they’re a member of and how much resources they’ve invested in climate work, Jan Erik Saugestad, the head of Storebrand Asset Management, said in an interview. Although Exxon and Chevron have joined the global Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, they’ve set no firm targets for cuts across their emissions, as opposed to European rivals.

More oil divestments could follow, Saugestad said. European oil majors like BP (NYSE: ) Plc, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Norway’s own Equinor ASA (NYSE: ) can’t “rest easy and continue with business as usual,” he said.

The new policy also bans companies that get more than 5% of their revenues coal, a target Storebrand earlier planned to reach by 2026.

Small Divestment

Divestments as a result of the new policy were completed this year, Saugestad said, declining to be more specific. At a total of $47 million (almost half related to Exxon and Chevron alone), they represent a small share of Storebrand’s assets.

“The most important for us is to send a clear signal that we expect that the companies will cooperate with us,” Saugestad said. “In a global context, we’re quite a small player. But we’re also in a leading global position on sustainable investments.”

Storebrand has been at the forefront of a campaign to put pressure on Brazil to protect the Amazon (NASDAQ: ) forest, bringing together funds with more than $4.6 trillion in assets. It’s also removed all oil investments from its Swedish unit.

By Liz Hampton and Jennifer Hiller

(Reuters) - BP (L: ), Shell (L: ) and Chevron Corp (N: ) on Friday said they had begun evacuating offshore oil facilities, with two tropical cyclones heading toward the U.S Gulf of Mexico as the already active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season heats up further.

BP said it had begun the process of evacuating personnel from offshore platforms and drilling rigs, while also beginning to shut-in production at its four operated platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Mad Dog and Na Kika.

Shell said it had started to reduce non-essential personnel on some of its offshore facilities. It said there was currently no effect on production and work was underway to secure drilling operations.

Meanwhile, Chevron said it was evacuating all personnel at its Big Foot, Genesis, Jack/St. Malo and Tahiiti platforms and initiating shut-in procedures. It also began evacuating non-essential workers from its Blind Faith and Petronius platforms, but said production remained normal.

The tropical cyclones churning toward the Gulf of Mexico could both could make landfall as hurricanes next week, an extremely rare event that could cause massive disruption from Texas to the Florida Panhandle.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/oil-majors-begin-offshore-evacuations-as-storms-take-aim-at-gulf-of-mexico-2195104,0.037,0.94,0.023,-0.5187

(Bloomberg) -- Oil and chemical facilities located along the Texas Gulf Coast are shuttering, securing equipment or running through emergency protocols ahead of a rare double storm set to rip through the region this week.

Some of the largest U.S. refineries are winding down in advance of Tropical Storms Marco and Laura, which could become a major hurricane before landfall, potentially shutting in more than 1 million barrels a day of capacity. Oil operators in the Gulf of Mexico have already shut in more than half of their output. The last time two storms hit the Gulf together was more than six decades ago.

Oil and gasoline prices rallied on the disruptions, as fears that the shuttering of the key refineries would mean less availability for oil products. Gasoline futures jumped as much as 7.4% in the day, while the the spread between the prompt and second-month contracts, a closely watched indicator for supply and demand, rallied to as much as 58.8%.

Motiva Enterprises LLC is shutting both its 607,000 barrel-a-day oil refinery and chemical plant in Port Arthur, Texas, according to people familiar with the matter and a regulatory filing. Valero Energy Corp (NYSE: ). is also shutting its 335,000 barrel-a-day Port Arthur facility, sources said. Oil major Total SE is cutting crude runs by more than 50% at its 225,500 barrel-a-day refinery there. Port Arthur Mayor Thurman Bartie plans to a issue a mandatory evacuation for the city beginning at 6 a.m. local time tomorrow, according to a a Beaumont TV station tweet.

A Motiva official could not immediately be reached for comment. A Valero spokeswoman said the company is monitoring the storms and assessing protocols but did not specifically comment on the shutdown. Total declined to comment on operations.

Meanwhile, at Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: )., officials are readying production units for a possible shutdown at its 369,000 barrel-a-day Beaumont refinery, sources said. An Exxon spokesman said the company is making preparations for any severe weather associated with the storms, though its downstream operations are normal.

At LyondelBasell Industries N.V., which has a refinery in Houston, a spokeswoman said it is “assessing refining operations, securing equipment” and ensuring adequate supplies. Shell (LON: ) said its onshore operations remain normal, though it is one of the many companies that evacuated some personnel from offshore platforms as it shuts in production.

It’s fair to say it’s been a terrible year for the so far. As a result of the coronavirus, the index has fallen about 20% year to date. Many Footsie stocks have done much worse.

I own a number of FTSE 100 stocks that have taken a beating this year. For example, I own Shell (LON: ), which is down about 52%. I also own Lloyds Bank, which is down about 56%

Yet, overall, my share portfolio is up in 2020. It’s outperformed the FTSE 100 by a wide margin. And I’ve achieved this without doing anything complicated.

Interested to learn how I’ve beaten the UK’s main stock market index? Read on and I’ll tell you.

International stocks have helped me beat the FTSE 100 One thing that’s helped me beat the FTSE 100 this year is international diversification. This is something I was stressing the importance of last year.

The UK has plenty of world-class companies. But a fully-diversified portfolio should have exposure to companies listed internationally as well. My exposure to top companies listed overseas has made a huge difference to my returns this year.

For example, my largest portfolio holding (and Warren Buffett’s largest), Apple (NASDAQ: ), is up over 60% this year. Meanwhile, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (Google), two companies I have decent-sized stakes in, are up about 30% and 15% respectively.

My global equity funds and investment trusts have also done well this year. Fundsmith, Blue Whale Growth, and Polar Capital Global Technology are all up for the year. Meanwhile, Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust has soared higher.

Overall, this international exposure has really enhanced my returns.

Top UK shares But it’s not just about my international holdings. Another thing that’s led to outperformance is my exposure to UK mid-cap and small-cap companies. Many of these have outperformed the FTSE 100 by a wide margin in 2020.

For example, video game company Keywords Studios is up over 40% this year. Digital marketing specialist dotDigital is up about 35%. technology company Softcat, which is benefitting from the work-from-home trend, is up about 10%.

Having these kinds of under-the-radar growth stocks in my portfolio has boosted my returns significantly.

Stock market crash Finally, buying stocks during the stock market crash has also helped me outperform the FTSE 100.

You see, one thing I always do is keep some cash on the sidelines in preparation for a stock market pullback. Going into the stock market crash, around 20% of my portfolio was in cash. And when stocks crashed, I bought big. This has paid off.

For example, I bought ASOS (LON: ) shares at around 1,100p. They’re now near 5,000p. I bought JD Sports Fashion shares at 320p. They’re now near 670p. And I bought Hargreaves Lansdown (LON: ) at about 1,275p. They’re now at near 1,700p.

These kinds of gains have powered my portfolio higher in 2020.

Simple strategy Overall, there’s nothing complicated about my investment strategy. I simply diversified my portfolio and bought stocks when other investors were panicking. With a very simple investment strategy, I’ve outperformed the FTSE 100 by a wide margin.

Why I think the BP share price is too cheap to miss

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HBR +0.79% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Earlier in August, BP (LSE: LON: ) announced its new dividend strategy. The company proposed 5.25 cents per share for Q2, down from 10.5 cents in the previous quarter. Shell (LON: ) had previously announced a dividend cut in the early days of the Covid-19 crisis, and that shocked the market. The oil price is weak too. The result? The BP share price is down 43% so far in 2020. That’s more than twice the 100‘s fall.

But the picture is better than it might at first look. The firm says the dividend is “intended to remain fixed at this level, subject to the board’s decision each quarter“. But there’s more. It also makes “a commitment to return at least 60% of surplus cash to shareholders through share buybacks, once BP’s balance sheet has been deleveraged and subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating“.

I think that could do more for the BP share price over the long term than any amount of short-term cash handed out now. I’m always moaning about companies paying out high dividends, and letting them become entrenched in the minds of institutional shareholders, when they can’t afford it. But there’s a horribly pervasive short-term fear of losing face by not stumping up the big cash each quarter.

Another oil price slump Cheap oil doesn’t help the BP share price, that’s for sure. And the lockdown has precipitated another crash. That’s certainly putting additional pressure on the oil companies even while they’re still sorting themselves out after the chaos of the previous slump.

But the price of a barrel is already picking up. It dropped below $20 in April. And the crunch could spell serious trouble for heavily indebted smaller oil firms like Premier Oil (LON: ). But the price is already picking up again, reaching around $45. And that’s with the economy still way behind the point it’s likely to recover to in the fullness of time. Transport still remains heavily depressed too, with a serious knock-on effect for fuel oil. But this will also pass.

Dividends paid at the new lower rate of $21 per year would provide a yield of nearly 6% on the current BP share price. That’s still a cracking stream of income in my books. And we’ll hopefully see further shareholder returns in the form of buybacks, to realise that “commitment to return at least 60% of surplus cash“.

BP share price pessimism Now, there’s also the big move away from fossil fuels, and that will be hurting the BP share price too. But all these ‘carbon neutral’ pledges are not going to make oil use disappear any time soon. And guess who’s in the vanguard of research into alternative energy sources? It’s the big oil companies, like BP.

Yes, there are good reasons for pressure on BP as an investment. But I’m seeing the shares as significantly undervalued even with that in mind. It happens all the time when we’re in a stock market slump, and investors become disproportionately bearish. BP is an income buy for me, with potential recovery growth as a bonus.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - America's biggest oil and gas lobby group is ramping up its advertising spending ahead of the November election to persuade voters that is a climate-friendly fuel, according to ad buying data.

The campaign by the American Petroleum Institute (API), targeted at younger voters and some tight congressional races, is part of a global battle by the drilling industry to assuage growing fears over the role of natural gas in driving climate change.

U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden last month unveiled a $2 trillion plan to transition the American economy away from fossil fuels, including natural gas, if he beats incumbent Donald Trump, who is a drilling advocate. Biden's plan would support climate litigation against polluters who conceal information about environmental and health risks.

In the three weeks following Biden's climate announcement on July 14, API increased its spending on Facebook (NASDAQ: ) ads to an estimated average of $24,000 a day. That's about six times its average daily spending in the preceding six months, according to an analysis by InfluenceMap, a non-profit group whose data on lobbying is used by institutional investors.

(See graphic on API Facebook spending https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-GAS/CLIMATECHANGE/xklvydlbgpg)

Those ads mainly target a younger audience including 25-to-34-year-olds, according to a separate analysis by Bully Pulpit Interactive Media conducted on behalf of Reuters.

Meanwhile, API has spent an estimated $3.1 million on TV ads between Jan. 1 and Aug. 16, according to data from analytics firm iSpot, an increase of 51% over the same period in 2019.

The TV ads are part of API's ""Energy for Progress"" campaign, launched in January. For at least six months, the campaign's website cast natural gas as a ""clean"" fuel before that description was revised to ""cleaner"" on the site sometime in the last two months.

Climate scientists say that natural gas is not clean and is emerging as a major threat to the climate due to the sheer scale of carbon dioxide (CO2) the industry emits. In addition, they say, a significant amount of methane, a far more potent short-term warming agent, leaks during production of natural gas.

API points out on its website that when burned, natural gas produces about half as much planet-warming CO2 as coal and less air pollution, and has helped the United States reduce emissions by replacing coal in power plants.

API President Mike Sommers told Reuters that his group's advertising ahead of the election seeks ""to inform people of all generations of the importance of American energy leadership,"" including on the environment.

""In this country, there is a lot of energy illiteracy,"" he said.

DEFINE 'CLEAN'

Republican and Democratic politicians alike once saw natural gas as a ""bridge fuel"" to a low-carbon future, but some states, cities and towns have increasingly moved to phase out natural gas power generation or ban its use in new homes and buildings.

API declined to say why it switched to calling natural gas ""cleaner"" on its ""Energy for Progress"" website. It continues to use the words ""clean"" or ""clean-burning"" in relation to natural gas on its main website, api.org, and in Facebook ads.

Industry critics say the use of the word ""clean"" is not just a matter of semantics. Such claims about environmental friendliness are coming under greater scrutiny as the presidential campaign goes into its final stretch. Also, some institutional investors are pushing for more action on climate change, and the oil and gas industry faces lawsuits alleging it has deceived the public about the harm of its products.

""It's about using green imagery and language to convince the public that their products are part of the climate solution rather than the essence of the problem,"" said Richard Wiles, executive director of the Center for Climate Integrity, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C., which supports climate litigation against oil and gas companies.

API president Sommers said his group's ""Energy for Progress"" campaign is focused on 37 congressional districts across the country. He didn't detail which ones.

""API doesn't endorse candidates; we endorse policies,"" Sommers said. ""We want to make sure that no matter who is in control that we have pro-majorities for energy in the House and the Senate.""

Founded more than a century ago, API's mission in part is ""to influence public policy in support of a strong, viable U.S. oil and natural gas industry,"" according to its website.

The group's nearly 600 members include the major U.S. and European oil companies. Their senior executives have sat on API's board in recent years, according to the group's tax forms, although API declined to identify its current board members.

API received a total of $116 million from membership dues in 2018, according to the most recent tax form.

Among its members is Anglo-Dutch major Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) PLC, one of the largest oil companies in the world. In April, Shell said it paid API between $12.5 and $15 million in 2019. Whether any of this money was used for the ""Energy for Progress"" campaign was a question for API, Shell said. API declined to say how any of its members' contributions were used.

Shell told Reuters it ""has always been careful to note that natural gas is a cleaner alternative to other sources of energy – most notably coal.""

Some API ads and social media posts say gas is clean, not just cleaner than coal.

""Natural gas is already clean, affordable and efficient - and it's getting better every day,"" says one API ad on Facebook. Another ad, emblazoned across the doors of a train at a Washington, D.C. airport, depicts a man and a woman walking through a forest. ""Thanks to clean natural gas,"" says the slogan, ""U.S. CO2 emission levels are the lowest in a generation.""

Dustin Meyer, API's director of market development, told reporters in July that there may be ""no better example"" of a pragmatic solution to climate change than natural gas ""in driving out dirtier fuels from the power mix.""

Nevertheless, natural gas is a fossil fuel that emits CO2 when burned. Its surging use means the United States could have roughly the same CO2 emissions levels in 2050 as it does now, if no new policies to control emissions are implemented, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2020.

STRONG OPPOSITION

While reeling from an historic collapse in demand for oil and gas triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, API members also face dozens of climate-related lawsuits, most dating back several years.

Most recently, the attorneys general from Massachusetts, Minnesota and the District of Columbia have sued members of the fossil fuel industry, accusing companies of deceiving consumers about harms caused by their products.

API was named for the first time in the Minnesota suit, which alleges fraud, deceptive advertising and other violations.

Referring to claims about natural gas in the ""Energy for Progress"" campaign, Kate Konopka, assistant attorney general in the District of Columbia, told Reuters: ""We think this campaign is very much akin to Big Tobacco claims decades ago in terms of harmfulness around the improved value of light cigarettes.""

Maura Healey, the attorney general of Massachusetts, who helped kick off the wave of litigation, told Reuters that API's portrayal of gas as clean was ""just not true"" and consistent with a pattern of misinformation by the API.

In a statement to Reuters about the Minnesota suit, API said the oil industry was working to substantially reduce emissions and ""that any suggestion to the contrary was false.""

In Europe, advertising watchdogs have ruled against oil companies in the past year for presenting natural gas and other fossil fuels as environmentally friendly. Several cases have been resolved informally, with companies agreeing not to repeat contested claims, although one company was fined.

In the United States, now the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas, API members increasingly are subject to protests over new pipelines and pressure from activist investors over their lobbying activity.

In October 2018, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, a group of European pension funds and asset managers, urged companies to be more transparent over climate-related lobbying. The group collectively manages more than 30 trillion euros ($35.60 trillion) in assets - including in oil and gas.

Clare Richards, senior engagement manager for the Church of England Pensions Board, said omitting the full truth about natural gas is ""tantamount to false advertising.""

API president Sommers said some investors and activists will never accept the benefits of natural gas.

""I think we just view the future differently,"" he said.

£5,000 to invest? I think these 3 UK shares still seem to be bargains

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

The has recoverd somewhat from the March crash, although the British economy is in terrible shape. But, despite the rise, there are still good UK shares trading at what I think are bargain prices. Three companies that I think worth consideration are BP (LSE:LON: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE:RDSB), and Legal & General (LSE:LGEN).

UK shares worth considering It looks like the dividends of all British companies are under threat this year. In fact, about half of the Footsie companies have cancelled or significantly reduced their payouts.

The same is particularly true of the first two companies on my list. Both BP and Shell cut their dividends substantially. As we all know, BP and Shell are oil companies. And the oil industry is having a hard time right now due to Covid-19 restrictions.

What’s more, I am more inclined to think that it will take the governments all over the world ages to win the coronavirus battle. So, travel restrictions will last for some time. This will put pressure on oil prices for quite some time.

Oil companies However, the oil market is now really tight. Smaller companies have gone bankrupt. Then, the industry itself has been extremely underinvested for a long time. The majority of the supply cuts will most probably come from US shale. This will lead to a rise in oil prices in the long run. All that is obviously a positive for the ‘big guys’. Both Shell and BP have investment-grade credit ratings. So, it looks highly likely they will survive the current crisis and come back to normal as soon as the situation improves.

Legal & General As concerns Legal & General, a large insurance company, it seems to be quite a risky investment just like the whole financial sector. The thing is that many clients are still making claims. But fewer of them are willing to buy new insurance products because they tend to have less cash these days.

However, after the company released its half-year results, it became clear that the insurance company’s sales revenues are quite resilient, in spite of the crisis. The Group’s net profit did decrease, because of stock market volatility and lower interest rates. The good thing is that Legal & General’s shareholders can still enjoy their dividends. The Group hasn’t cut them. Although the company is the leader in the market and has a strong financial position, its shares are trading down about a third from their February highs.

Cheap British shares for brave investors? These UK shares are in no way the kind of momentum stocks my colleague Matthew wrote about. However, in my view, they are quite suitable for a patient investor who is willing to take on some additional risks. There’s indeed a risk that these British shares can go down. But long-term investors might be richly rewarded for taking these opportunities.

(Reuters) - The FTSE 100 fell for the first time in five sessions on Thursday as a clutch of blue-chip firms traded ex-dividend, while National Express Group slumped after reporting a pre-tax loss for the first half of the year.

The bus company (L: ) tumbled 12% and was on track for its worst day in four months as it said it was bracing for more pressure on its finances over the next year.

A 0.8% decline for the FTSE 100 ( ) pulled it back from three-week highs, with firms including AstraZeneca Plc (L: ), BP Plc (L: ), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) and Legal & General Group Plc (L: ) trading without entitlement to a dividend payout.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) was off 0.3% after ending Wednesday at a two-month high with investors betting on more fiscal and monetary stimulus to lift the world's sixth-largest economy from a deep coronavirus-induced recession.

""It seems that investors aren't feeling quite so confident in the FTSE now that the dust has settled on the latest GDP data,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex.

The FTSE 100 has bounced from its March lows but has underperformed its U.S. and European peers as data points to a much bigger hit to the UK economy from the health crisis.

Although key sectors such as housing have begun to show signs of a rebound, analysts have warned that the mini-boom could go bust once the government's jobs subsidy programme closes in less than three months' time and a tax cut expires at the end of March.

Global market sentiment also wobbled on Thursday following a strong finish on Wall Street overnight as focus turned to U.S.-China talks on Saturday to review the progress of their Phase 1 trade deal.

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 ( ) was largely unchanged in thin summer trading on Wednesday, hardly reacting to a surprise rise in domestic inflation last month and the British government's plan to ramp up COVID-19 testing.

Health minister Matt Hancock said Britain is planning to bring in population-wide mass testing for coronavirus to help control the pandemic, adding that the government is working with London's Heathrow Airport to shorten quarantine.

After starting the session in negative territory, the London blue chip index flattened at 0919 GMT, with shares in British Airways-owner IAG (L: ) jumping 3.2% to the top of the index.

Shares of Primark-owner Associated British Foods (L: ) gained 1.2% as consumer price inflation jumped last month to its highest rate since March, with clothing stores refraining from their usual summer discounts after reopening from lockdowns.

""UK inflation came in quite a bit higher than expected in July,"" said James Smith, ING developed markets economist.

""A much less pronounced fall in clothing prices than we'd normally see at this time of year seemed to be the main culprit.""

Meanwhile, in the groceries space, Morrison (L: ) shares gained 1.1% after it listed its products on Amazon (NASDAQ: ) for same-day delivery. Shares in online grocer Ocado (L: ) were up 1.5%, while market leader Tesco 's (L: ) shares were down 0.5% on negative read-across.

Lower oil prices capped gains and dented trading in energy stocks, with BP Plc (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) being among the biggest drags. [O/R]

Persimmon (L: ) shares dipped as the company said the chief executive officer of bus company National Express Group (L: ), Dean Finch, will take up the top job at the homebuilder earlier than envisaged.

FTSE 100 dividend stocks: a UK share I’d buy in an ISA as BHP Group slashes payouts

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BNZL +0.06% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BDEV -0.08% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio PSN +1.71% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio TW +1.14% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio Copper -0.26% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

2020 has proved to be a nightmare year for dividend investors. UK shares have slashed, postponed, or cancelled altogether shareholder payouts as the Covid-19 crisis has crushed balance sheets and decimated earnings outlooks. Around half of companies alone have made serious changes to their dividend policies in a blow to investors’ income flows.

The bad news has got even worse on Tuesday. Today, mega miner BHP Group (LSE: BHP) announced that it was cutting the final dividend for fiscal 2020, to 55 US cents from 78 cents previously. The FTSE 100 giant saw pre-tax profits slump 10% in the 12 months to June. It cited lower and petroleum prices and Covid-19-related mine shutdowns.

BHP’s decision to scythe down the dividend didn’t come as a shock to some. As Link Group comments: “With dividend cover already so low (1.2 times last year) a cut was hard to avoid and will save BHP around £800m in 2020 alone.”

A FTSE 100 dividend share I’d buy today BHP follows other FTSE 100 alumni like Shell (LON: ) and Bunzl (LON: ) in recently cutting dividends. But it’s not all bad news. There are plenty of blue-chip UK shares I expect to continue doling out big payouts to their shareholders now and in the future. Housebuilder Persimmon (LSE: LON: ) is one of these.

While BHP was cutting dividends, the news coming from the housebuilder today has been much more positive. The FTSE 100 firm said it was reinstating the dividend with an interim payment of 40p. This is on account of its “strong” start to the second half of the year, with a near-50% jump in average weekly private sales since the beginning of July.

I’m expecting demand for its newbuilds to remain strong long into the future too, because of Britain’s huge housing shortage which will take years to fix. Its huge £2.5bn order book (up 21% year-on-year) is perfect evidence of this.

Okay, Persimmon can expect annual profits growth to slow in the near term as tough economic conditions weigh on property prices. But that aforementioned housing crunch should stop home values dropping off a cliff. And significant government support like Help to Buy and stamp duty holidays should support sales volumes.

Getting rich with UK shares At current prices, Persimmon trades on an undemanding forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13 times. It carries an inflation-mashing dividend yield north of 4% for 2020 too.

I bought its FTSE 100 rivals Barratt Developments (LON: ) and Taylor Wimpey (LON: ) for my own ISA because of the bright outlook for these builders during this new decade. And I’d happily load up on Persimmon shares too.

Persimmon’s just one top-quality FTSE 100 dividend stock trading below true value right now. This is why we at The Motley Fool reckon the 2020 stock market crash offers an excellent opportunity for share investors to make big returns. And The Motley Fool’s vast library of special reports reveals even more too-cheap-to-miss UK shares to help you make a fortune from buying shares.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1.15 trillion (873.4 billion pounds) wealth fund expects more turmoil on financial markets as the world continues to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, a top fund official said on Tuesday, after it posted a 188-billion-crown loss ($21 billion) in the first half of 2020.

The pandemic is not under control ""in any shape or form"" and remains the biggest issue for investors, said deputy CEO Trond Grande, after presenting the half-year results of the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.

The fund lost $153 billion between January and March as markets plunged, its worst quarter ever, but earned back $131 billion from April to the end of June amid a rebound, its best quarter on record.

""We could be in for some turbulence this fall as things unfold and whether or not the coronavirus pandemic recedes, or gains some force,"" Grande told Reuters.

""We have already seen some sort of V-shaped recovery in the financial markets. I think there is a slight disconnect between the real economy and the financial markets,"" he said, noting that government support for economies could only be sustained for so long.

The full fallout for some sectors, such as leisure and travel, was yet to be seen, Grande said.

Founded in 1996, the fund holds stakes in around 9,200 companies globally, owning 1.5% of all listed stocks. It also invests in bonds and real estate.

Its overall value is equivalent to approximately $214,000 for every man, woman and child in Norway.

The overall portfolio had a negative return of 3.4% in the first half of the year, with declines of 6.8% for equities and 1.6% for unlisted real estate, while the value of fixed-income holdings rose 5.1% as interest rates plunged.

The overall return was 11 basis points lower than the return on the fund's benchmark index.

Oil companies were the weakest performers, with their stocks declining by 33.1% due to the slide in crude prices, while technology firms had the strongest development, gaining 14.2%.

The Velocys share price is fluctuating. Is this FTSE AIM All-Share stock a contrarian buy?

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ICAG -0.55% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio FTAI -0.49% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Index stock Velocys (LON:VLS) is an innovative company utilising its technology for the good of the planet. It is doing this through the creation of sustainable fuels for aviation and heavy goods transport. The company listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2006 as Oxford Catalysts, but changed its name to Velocys in 2013. Being an offshoot of Oxford University gives it a degree of prestige and integrity. The Velocys share price has been on a bumpy ride, but speculation is rife and this may well prove to be a contrarian stock to buy.

Velocys share price turbulence Oxford Catalysts was set up to create renewable fuel out of biomass and waste. It then acquired Velocys from a US department of energy research laboratory. Velocys had reactor technology conceived for space colonisation, which could be adapted and was exactly what Oxford Catalysts needed to bring its renewable fuel dream to market. In 2017, Velocys transitioned from being a tech company to focus on renewable fuels.

At its IPO, the Velocys share price enjoyed a trade high of £2.18 but it only briefly reached those dizzy heights again in early 2014. The company’s valuation is currently around £85m. It has a debt ratio of 25%, a negative price-to-earnings ratio, and no dividend yield.

The Velocys share price is up 275% year-to-date but has dropped 55% since its June high of 14.8p. These massive fluctuations both make and break investors, so it is not a stock for the faint of heart. That being said, I think VLS shows potential as an investment.

Promising environmental solutions Emerging from lockdown and getting back to a sense of normality is what the world is striving for. Saving the planet in the process would be an added bonus. Reducing waste and carbon emissions are two of the world’s most sought-after solutions as climate change looms over policymakers everywhere. This puts the company in the enviable position of potentially solving not one but two major environmental problems.

Commercialising scientific breakthroughs is never easy, and there are many hurdles to overcome before turning a profit. However, a combination of climate change fear and the pandemic may provide the catalyst needed for the business to forge ahead and boost the Velocys share price.

Revenue streams In June Velocys reported administrative costs had fallen, reducing its annual loss. It also confirmed British Airways owner IAG (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) had pledged £1m of funding for its Altalto waste-to-fuels project in Lincolnshire. At this facility it aims to produce enough fuel for 1,000 transatlantic flights a year and expects production to begin in 2025. Building the plant will probably cost between £350m and £500m.

Revenue for the year fell from £0.7m to £0.3m according to unaudited figures. It makes its money from a mixture of revenue streams including licensing its technology, supplying reactors, catalysts, and technical services. This month it completed the manufacture and delivery of four reactors to Red Rock Biofuels, in Oregon, with the option to purchase two more reactors by the end of the year.

Going by its track record and the current state of the aviation industry, this stock comes with significant risk. Nevertheless, its potential to solve major industry problems makes me think it is one to watch.

This solid FTSE 100 share has dived 10.4% in three months. I’d buy it today!

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BATS -2.54% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HSBA -1.33% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio IMB +1.29% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio KGF -0.96% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio TSCO +0.04% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio DGE -0.91% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio FRES -3.35% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

On Thursday evening, the closed down 94.5 points (1.5%) at 6,185. This followed a four-day gain of 4.7% from Friday to Wednesday. These are the dangerous dog days of August.

The FTSE 100 is up 4.8% in three months From 13 May to 13 August, the FTSE 100 climbed over 280 points (4.8%). Not bad, given we were locked down for two of these months. But the big gains came from 23 March to 29 April, when the index surged 1,120 points (22.5%).

As an index, the FTSE 100 measures the aggregate value of its 101 members. (It’s 101, because Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) has two UK-listed shares.) Of course, some of its shares have done far better than others.

Some FTSE 100 shares have soared In the three months to 13 August, returns from FTSE 100 shares were very widely dispersed. Indeed, the difference in returns between the ‘best’ and ‘worst’ share is almost 95 percentage points.

Top performer is Mexican miner Fresnillo (LON: ) (+78.3) and then British retailer Kingfisher (LON: ) (+61.7%). Including these two, there are eight FTSE 100 shares up 40% or more in three months.

Next come 13 FTSE 100 shares up by 30% to 40%, followed by 24 shares up 20% to 30% – all easily beating the index’s 4.7% return.

Next are 23 stocks up 10% to 20% in three months and then 21 shares with single-digit positive returns. In total, that comes to 89 FTSE 100 shares with gains over the three months to 13 August.

Huh? How can this be correct? Therefore, only 12 FTSE 100 shares fell over in the three months to 13 August. These fallers were down from 0.2% to 16.7%. Hence, there are no really massive losers at the bottom of this table.

But how on earth can 89 shares be up and only 12 stocks be down, yet the index has risen a mere 4.8%? The answer is the FTSE 100 is an index weighted by market value. Thus, the bigger the company, the more its share-price moves affect the wider index.

The big beasts have struggled Using a simple, unweighted average, the FTSE 100 index would be ahead by 18.2%, not the actual 4.8% recorded. That’s because so many index heavyweights have seen share-price declines during this period.

By heavyweights, I mean massive, global businesses such as drug firms AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline. Other fallen giants include drinks behemoth Diageo (LON: ), supermarket Goliath Tesco (LON: ), and tobacco leaders British American Tobacco (LON: ), and Imperial Brands (LON: ).

HSBC is my pick of the fallen giants One other ‘fallen giant’ remains: global mega-bank HSBC Holdings (LSE: LON: ) (down 10.4% in three months). This banking stalwart lends heavily in East Asia, particularly in Hong Kong and China. That’s why its shares have been hammered by the ‘double whammy’ of Covid-19 and deteriorating US-China relations.

Currently hovering around 340p, HSBC shares have almost halved (down 43.6%) over the past year. Furthermore, they are less than 6.5% above their 52-week low around 320p, set on 3 August. Yet, on 11 September last year, HSBC shares peaked at 633.5p. That’s almost double their current level.

Today, HSBC is valued at £69.8bn, which is a fraction of the valuation of big global banks with similar size, scale, and scope. To me, that’s crazy. Hence, I’d buy HSBC today and hold this FTSE 100 share for capital growth and the return of chunky dividends!

MELBOURNE/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Western Australia's industrial safety regulator said it will provide an update later on Friday on the outcome of Chevron Corp's (N: ) inspections of two of the three processing units at its giant Gorgon liquefied (LNG) plant.

Traders are keenly awaiting word as the Gorgon plant produces 15.6 million tonnes of LNG annually, or about 4.5% of the global trade in LNG in 2019.The regulator ordered Chevron two weeks ago to carry out the inspections on propane heat exchangers on Trains 1 and 3 at the plant by Aug. 21, after weld problems were found on propane kettles in Train 2 during scheduled maintenance.

If problems are found in the kettle welds of Trains 1 and 3, Chevron may have to shut them for repair. Train 2 is due to be restarted in early September after maintenance was extended for two months for the weld repairs.

Chevron had no immediate comment on the outcome of the inspections.

The Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety said it would provide an update on Friday.

Two Singapore-based LNG traders said Chevron has informed Gorgon customers it can supply them from Wheatstone and North West Shelf LNG, raising speculation Trains 1 and 3 will be shut.

The company is also in the market looking to buy LNG cargoes for October through December, the traders said.

""It will be a bullish winter if a big (supply) source like this has issues, especially if it is a cold winter,"" one of the traders said.

Chevron declined to comment on customer contracts, as they are confidential.

Chevron is operator and 47.3% owner of Gorgon.

NEW DELHI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Oil major Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) plans to buy a 50% stake in Indian-based Nayara Energy's up to $9 billion (6.9 billion pounds) planned petrochemical project, a source familiar with the matter said.

Global oil majors are looking at expanding foothold in the vast Indian market, where local refiners are investing billions of dollars to boost their petrochemical capacities.

They are looking to meet an expected surge in demand for goods ranging from plastics to paints as the country seeks to promote durable, cheaper materials in industries such as farming and food packaging.

Shell and Nayara - which is part-owned by Russian oil major Rosneft (MM: ) - signed a memorandum of understanding in early June, the source said, adding an equal joint venture will be created for building the project.

""The petrochemical joint venture between Nayara and Shell was discussed at board of directors meetings of Nayara in November and December last year,"" another source said.

The 1.8 million tonnes a year full steam ethylene cracker and linked downstream units to be build at Vadinar in western Gujarat state would cost $8 billion-$9 billion and would be completed in five years, the first source said.

The project will also have an aromatic complex and capacity to produce 10.75 million tonnes of a variety of petrochemicals, according to Nayara's proposal to the environment ministry.

Shell declined to comment on the project while Nayara did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Along with the petrochemical complex, Nayara also aims to expand its current 400,000 barrels per day Vadinar refinery to 920,000 bpd. The refinery expansion and petrochemical project are estimated to cost nearly 1.3 trillion Indian rupees (13 billion pounds).

India's environment ministry would hold a meeting on the expansion project on Aug 29-30, the first source said.

In India, Shell operates a liquefied import terminal, a port, fuel stations and a plant to turn waste into petrol or diesel. Last year it signed an equity investment deal with an Indian company specialising in biomass aggregation and processing for energy production.

345,345,SHEL,2020-08-11,Dividend cuts: I think these stocks should avoid the chop By The Motley Fool,"Published Aug 11, 2020 17:19 Updated Aug 11, 2020 17:40

Dividend cuts: I think these stocks should avoid the chop

BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio NG -1.50% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

BP (LON: ) has followed in the footsteps of its rival Shell (LON: ) and imposed a dividend cut. Oil majors are far from alone in cutting back shareholder payouts in the face of economic uncertainty. With the potential for more cuts on the cards if the economy worsens, here is where I’d look for income.

The Steady Eddie dividend payer National Grid (LSE: LON: ) has a very respectable dividend yield of 5.4%. In the current environment that is a great income. It’s also one that’s unlikely to be cut, I believe. The combination of predictable revenues, alongside potential growth in the US and in its unregulated ventures division make me think it can raise earnings.

National Grid as a utility is less susceptible to the wider economy. Even if we’re unfortunate enough to get a second wave of coronavirus or the economy falters for other reasons, there will be a need for electricity.

On the dividend front, there have been steady increases. Keeping dividend growth incremental is sensible given National Grid’s need to invest in networks and regulated earnings. Between 2018 and this year, the dividend went from 45.93p to 48.57p, so there is a clear upwards trajectory.

Regulated utilities won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. There will never be strong growth from this share, but the dividend should be relatively safe and that’s good for compounding or for providing income now.

I believe National Grid has a dividend that’s sustainable and should avoid the chop, unlike many others right now.

A growth market to build shareholder returns If it’s more dividend growth you’re after, rather than yield, then I’d suggest looking at Segro (LSE: SGRO). The warehousing company is riding the e-commerce wave. This has been particularly the case recently, with e-commerce being a winner from the coronavirus. A rise in online shopping means a greater need for warehouses that process orders. This is good news for Segro.

Just last week it lifted its interim dividend. This came alongside a pre-tax profit increase of 6.5% to £140.4m in the six months to the end of June.

A yield of not much over 2% might not be enticing at first glance, but consider the potential for income growth. The track record here is good with the dividend increasing from 15.6 in 2015 to 20.7p in 2019. With earnings also rising strongly, dividend cover has remained high, giving management the ability to keep raising the dividend. I fully expect it to keep doing so, even as management expands the business.

With e-commerce set to keep on rising, I can’t see demand for Segro’s warehouses declining any time soon. This is the best type of property to be invested in right now. I expect the share price and the dividend will keep rising nicely together.

I think that combined, National Grid and Segro have a lot to offer to investors looking for sustainable income. Chasing high yields at the current time isn’t sensible, but these companies should hopefully avoid any dividends chops.

(Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil (N: ) said on Tuesday it has signed an agreement with Global Clean Energy to buy 2.5 million barrels of renewable diesel per year for five years to help reduce its carbon footprint.

Investors in recent years have increased pressure on fossil fuel companies, including Exxon Mobil, to reduce emissions, spend more on low-carbon energy and make disclosures on the impact of fossil fuel production on climate change.

The renewable diesel will be sourced from Global Clean Energy's refinery in Bakersfield, California, starting 2022. The plant is among several traditional oil refineries being converted to manufacture renewable diesel, as demand for the alternative fuel continues to grow. Exxon said it plans to distribute the renewable diesel within California and potentially to other domestic and international markets.

In a first, a group of the world's top oil companies set goals this year to cut their greenhouse gas emissions as a proportion of output, as pressure on the sector's climate stance grows.

The 12-member group's Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), includes BP (L: ), Chevron (N: ), CNPC, Eni, Equinor (OL: ), Exxon, Occidental Petroleum (N: ), Petrobras, Repsol (MC: ), Saudi Aramco (SE: ), Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Total (PA: ), which together account for over 30% of the world's oil and gas production.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exxon-to-buy-renewable-diesel-from-global-clean-energy-for-five-years-2186538,0.026,0.912,0.063,0.8925

Bitcoin’s price may have rallied after its downturn earlier this year, but crashing UK shares could offer greater long-term returns. A number of and stocks are yet to recover from the market crash, and may therefore offer good value for money.

Here are two prime examples of such stocks. Although they may yet face further share price volatility in the short run due to weak operating conditions, in the long run they could deliver strong capital growth. As such, now could be an opportune moment to buy them in a diversified ISA portfolio.

Shell (LON: ): a cheap oil and gas company among UK shares Shell (LSE: RDSB) has been among the biggest-falling UK shares in 2020. The oil and gas major is currently trading over 50% down on its price from the start of the year.

Of course, a key reason for its share price decline is reduced demand for oil. Alongside supply growth, this has caused the price of oil to fall to exceptionally low levels in recent months. As a result, the company has reduced its long-term oil price expectations, which has caused huge impairments in its recent results.

Looking ahead, Shell plans to pivot towards cleaner forms of energy. Although this process may not be smooth, it appears to have the financial means to invest heavily in low-carbon energy assets. Over time, this could not only improve its financial performance, but lead to stronger investor sentiment that boosts its share price.

As such, now could be the right time to buy a slice of it while it appears to offer a wider margin of safety than many other UK shares.

Glencore (LON: ): recovery potential after its share price fall Glencore (LSE: GLEN) is another FTSE 100 stock that has underperformed many UK shares in 2020. The mining and commodity trading giant’s stock price has declined by around 30% since the start of the year. A slowing world economic outlook has caused investors to factor in a wider margin of safety.

The company’s recent half-year results showed its marketing division has produced a relatively strong performance. This may help to differentiate it from other commodity companies, and could provide the business with strong growth during a period of weaker economic performance.

Glencore also announced its divisions have largely been able to operate in recent months, despite ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic. Its diverse range of activities could help to protect it against operational challenges in specific markets or locations.

Looking ahead, investor sentiment towards commodity stocks and other UK shares could weaken due to risks posed by an uncertain economic outlook. However, with what appears to be a sound strategy and a diverse range of operations, Glencore could offer recovery prospects over the coming years after a challenging 2020.

There are many ways to make money as an investor. Some attempt to build a UK buy-to-let empire to supplement their income in retirement. But I think there’s a much better way. For me, it’s buying cheap shares.

The admin requirements for buying and holding buy-to-let property are extensive, time-consuming and often confusing. The capital outlay is weighty. You’d better have amassed a small fortune before you even start.

That’s before we consider the harsher tax treatment for buy-to-let landlords that makes these property investments much less attractive.

Buy to let again The UK property market is in a constant state of flux. And while there are maps of the best-returning rental areas across England and Wales, these change constantly.

Headline yields of 8%, 9% or 10% a year can compete with the best cheap FTSE 100 shares, certainly. But there is no real way to rely on the income from buy to let. Bad tenants are everywhere.

Yes, background checks can weed out the worst of them. But if a good tenant falls into financial difficulty through no fault of their own, you could lose out on rent for months at a time. That’ll kill those 8%-10% yields. And with the UK jobs market shrinking and unemployment rising, there are far too many unknowns on the horizon.

Depressing July 2020 forecasts from the OECD says that the UK jobless rate is likely to triple to nearly 15% if we are hit with a second coronavirus wave.

Buy cheap FTSE 100 shares instead Buying FTSE 100 shares, by contrast, is remarkably easy. I set aside a few hundred pounds a month and buy top blue-chip shares like BP (LON: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Legal & General.

With my ISA and SIPP provider, Hargreaves Lansdown (LON: ), I get a discount on the cost of buying shares because I do so in regular amounts every month.

Now is one of the best times to buy cheap FTSE 100 shares because the choice is wide and the potential returns greater than they have been for some time.

The Bank of England has said that the UK economy likely won’t return to where it was pre-pandemic until late 2021. That means there are plenty of quality companies experiencing a short-term share price dip. Buying cheap FTSE 100 shares now offers the chance for share price appreciation as confidence creeps back into markets. You also get dividend payments as a bonus for holding on to stock.

Reinvesting dividends Most Stocks and Shares ISAs allow you to automatically reinvest dividend payments. It’s a low-stress process that requires zero brain space.

Recently I saw the fruits of my regular investing process.

For buying up 457 shares in Legal & General, the company paid me a dividend of 12.64p per share. That equals £57.76.

I didn’t take that cash out of my Stocks and Shares ISA as income. Instead the ISA automatically reinvested the money to buy more Legal & General shares.

These small incremental gains will mean that in 10 years time I will have amassed a serious amount of LGEN shares, with my dividend payments growing in turn every year.

Even if I didn’t already own LGEN stock, at a dividend yield of 7.65% and a low P/E ratio of 7.4 times earnings, I’d be happy to invest in these cheap FTSE 100 shares.

NEW YORK/LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - I Squared Capital is planning an auction to sell power firm Energia Group later this year, with the infrastructure fund aiming to secure a valuation of around 2 billion euros ($2.35 billion) including debt, sources familiar with the matter said.

Called Viridian Group until a 2019 rebranding, Energia owns and operates around 1 gigawatt of renewable and conventional power generation in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and provides gas and electricity to over 750,000 customers, according to its website.

A sale process for Energia is expected to begin later this year, subject to market conditions, according to four sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public.

I Squared and Energia declined to comment.

I Squared acquired Energia in 2016 for 1 billion euros (900 million pounds) and ran an unsuccessful process to sell it in 2018. Since then, Energia has sought to boost its renewable energy portfolio amid a push by European policymakers to make power production greener.

European oil producers are also pivoting away from hydrocarbons, as they aim to make themselves holistic energy companies, adding a new group of possible buyers for Energia.

BP PLC (L: ) said last week it planned to reduce its oil and gas production by 40% by 2030, while massively expanding into renewable energy, aiming at a 20-fold increase in renewables generation over the same period.

When Eneco was sold earlier this year to a consortium led by Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp (T: ) for 4.1 billion euros, the Dutch energy firm attracted interest from other oil producers, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L: ).

In the year to March 31, Energia Group generated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 157.2 million euros, and had net debt of 714.3 million euros at that time, according to its annual report.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/i-squared-eyes-24-billion-sale-of-power-firm-energia--sources-2186555,0.022,0.899,0.079,0.9413

I’d invest £10k in these UK shares in a V-shaped recovery

If you’d told other investors you expected a V-shaped recovery just a couple of weeks ago, you’d have been branded a simpleton. You might just have been hounded off social media as a blinkered optimist.

But the state of the UK stock market means a V-shaped recovery is entirely possible. This scenario suggests we’ve already seen the lowest point of the , below 5,000 points.

In this sequence of events, our portfolios will eventually bounce back to where they were pre-crash. So what would I invest in today?

What a V-shaped recovery is not We hear today the UK has fallen into the deepest recession in history. That’s a 20.4% hit to GDP from the coronavirus pandemic.

But a V-shaped recovery doesn’t mean an immediate snap back to a rocketing stock market. It’s simply a sustained recovery from the depths of a sharp economic decline.

Central banks and governments desperately want to avoid an L-shaped recovery. That would mean persistently high unemployment over many years. It would mean no return to growth for perhaps half a decade. Economic stimulus in the form of hundreds of billions of pounds from the Bank of England is all to avoid this state of affairs.

What a V-shaped recovery is Most investors don’t like to buy undervalued UK shares in a crashing market, even if a V-shaped recovery is on the cards. But this is precisely where you can make the biggest gains of your investing life.

Especially if you can avoid trendy fads and focus on FTSE 100, and AIM market strength.

Remember Warren Buffett’s mantra: “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”

What if you had bought £10,000 of FTSE 100 insurer Aviva (LON: ) at the bottom of the March crash? You’d be sitting on 27.5% gains in less than six months. That’s a handy capital appreciation of £2,750. Something any private investor would be happy to have essentially for free.

What I’d invest £10k in now A strong selection of the finest UK shares come to mind when I think about how I’d invest several thousand pounds.

From the FTSE 100, I’d be looking at either BP (LON: ) or Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ). I think both will gain strongly from this low point as demand for oil returns to the world.

I recommended FTSE 250 B&Q owner Kingfisher (LON: ) as the best share for June 2020 and I think it will continue its stonking 117% rise over the last three months of the year. Home improvements have proved exceedingly popular since lockdown and I see this trend continuing across Europe, where Kingfisher owns top DIY stores.

From among the UK’s smaller companies I’d pick £390m market cap Dotdigital. Its bosses told the market this month that the business would see minimal impact from Covid-19. And its share price has hit recent all-time-highs. Profits, revenues, and earnings per share are all rising year over year. With a price-to-earnings growth ratio of just 0.4, it remains undervalued to my mind. In fact, I see DOTD continuing its stellar rise whether there’s a V-shaped recovery or not.

This year’s stock market crash caught many investors by surprise. While the market has recovered some of its losses over the past few months, there’s no guarantee this trend will continue.

The coronavirus crisis continues to rumble on, and the outlook for the UK economy is bleak. A second wave of coronavirus could cause another market slump later in the year.

However, some companies could be attractive investments, no matter what the future holds for the stock market. stocks, like the two businesses below, could even generate positive returns in the next stock market crash. As such, now may be a good time to snap up a share of these defensive businesses.

Stock market crash bargains Investor sentiment towards oil giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) has crumbled this year. The company’s decision to slash its dividend following the collapse in the oil price caused many income investors to sell the stock. Falling oil prices have also hit the group’s profits.

Despite these issues, Shell’s outlook has improved significantly since the stock market crash in March. For example, the price of oil has risen by more than 300% since the end of April. The group’s trading and refining operations have also provided additional profits. This income has helped the business avoid any financial stress.

Following the recent increase in oil prices, City analysts are now expecting the group’s earnings per share to rise 150% in 2021. And even after the recent dividend cut, the stock still supports a market-beating dividend yield of 5.4%.

Considering these figures, and the fact the stock has fallen 42% over the past 12 months, now could be a good time buy a share of Shell as part of a diversified portfolio while it trades at a low level. The company’s recovery over the next few years could produce high total returns for investors.

Fresnillo (LON: ) As one of the largest public precious metal miners, Fresnillo (LSE: FRES) may have the qualities to protect any portfolio from a stock market crash. In times of market turbulence, the price of precious metals, such as gold and silver, can increase. This increases the profit margins for miners like Fresnillo.

Wider profit margins mean fatter profits for shareholders. Indeed, analysts are currently expecting Fresnillo to report a 47% increase in income for 2020, followed by growth of 70% in 2021. They’re also projecting an 83% dividend increase in 2021.

If the company hits this target, the stock will offer a yield of 2.1%. As many other FTSE 100 businesses slashed their payouts in the stock market crash, this could make Fresnillo one of the market’s top blue-chip income stocks.

Therefore, if you’re looking for a company to protect your portfolio in the next stock market crash, Fresnillo could be the best choice. The firm has outperformed this year, and it seems likely the business will continue to prosper as the outlook for the global economy remains uncertain.

BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio XOM -2.14% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (L: ) is preparing to sell a large chunk of its oil and gas assets even if crude prices bounce back from the COVID-19 crash because it wants to invest more in renewable energy, three sources familiar with BP's thinking said.

The strategy was discussed at a BP executives meeting in July, the sources said, soon after the oil major lowered its long-term oil price forecast to $55 a barrel, meaning that $17.5 billion (13 billion pounds) worth of its assets are no longer economically viable.

But even if crude prices bounce back to $65-$70 a barrel, BP is unlikely to put those assets back into its exploration plans and would instead use the better market conditions as an opportunity to sell them, the three sources said.

Major oil companies typically hold assets for the long term, even when crude prices plunge, with a view to start bringing more marginal production online when market conditions improve.

However, BP's new divestment strategy, which has not previously been reported, means there will be no way back for the British energy company once it has offloaded its so-called stranded oil and gas assets.

BP did not respond to requests for comment.

The new strategy also sheds more light on chief executive Bernard Looney's plan to reduce BP's oil and gas production by 40%, or at least 1 million barrels per day, by 2030 while expanding into renewable energy.

""It is a simple calculation of natural production decline and planned divestment,"" said a BP source, explaining how BP became the first big oil company to pledge a large cut in its oil output.

For decades, BP and rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Exxon Mobil (N: ) have promised investors that production would continue to rise.

But as climate activists, investors, banks and some governments raise pressure on the industry to reduce emissions to help cool the planet, European oil firms are changing tack and pledging to invest more in renewable energy sources.

U.S. rivals are under less government pressure and have not made similar commitments on renewables.

""As we look at the outlook for BP over the next few years and as we see production declining by 40% it is clear we no longer need exploration to fund new growth,"" Looney said this week. ""We will not enter new countries to explore.""

He said BP would continue to explore for oil near its existing production infrastructure as those barrels would be low cost - and help boost BP's cash flow to fund its transition to cleaner energy.

FROM CANADA TO ANGOLA

BP also raised its target this week for returns from asset sales to $25 billion between 2020 and 2025, of which about $12 billion has already been lined up.

It has yet to name the other assets it wants to sell.

Sources have previously told Reuters that BP has identified Canadian oil sands assets and projects in deep water off Angola as being uneconomical under its new oil price scenario.

For a graphic of BP's stranded assets, click on https://tmsnrt.rs/3fNShQX

One of the three sources said BP's divestment targets could easily be exceeded if it sells most of its assets currently viewed as stranded.

Parul Chopra, analyst at Rystad Energy, said in addition to Angola, he expected BP to move out of Azerbaijan, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq.

""In Iraq, the rates of returns are quite low. That fits into that profile, with high greenhouse gas emissions, they would want to exit that,"" he said.

BP is planning a 10-fold increase in investment in low carbon energy sources to about $5 billion per year by 2030 and wants to deliver a 20-fold increase in renewables capacity to generate 50 gigawatts through new projects and acquisitions.

But with debt of close to $50 billion, BP will essentially be moving from one capital intensive business - oil - to another capital intensive business with lower margins - renewables.

At the moment, such a shift might be attractive to BP investors demanding the company move away from fossil fuels, but analysts say they should be prepared for lower margins.

Oil majors generally target a 12% to 15% return on their investments in oil. BP has said it is aiming for a return of 8% to 12% for renewables.

""Investors are pushing for a faster transition, but weak balance sheets mean the pivot is a challenge, leading companies to dismantle core businesses in order to facilitate the ramp up in capex (capital spending),"" said Biraj Borkhataria at RBC Capital Markets.

Borkhataria said he expected BP to divest as much as 500,000 barrels a day of production while losing a similar amount through the natural decline in output from oilfields.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/exclusive-bp-poised-to-sell-stranded-assets-even-if-oil-prices-rally-2183386,0.064,0.819,0.117,0.9918

(Reuters) - The world's five largest oil companies collectively cut the value of their assets by nearly $50 billion in the second quarter, and slashed production rates as the coronavirus pandemic caused a drastic fall in fuel prices and demand.

The dramatic reductions in asset valuations and decline in output show the depth of the pain in the second quarter. Fuel demand at one point was down by more than 30% worldwide, and still remains below pre-pandemic levels.

Several executives said they took massive writedowns because they expect demand to remain impaired for several more quarters as people travel less and use less fuel due to the ongoing global pandemic that has killed more than 700,000 people.

(GRAPHIC: Output falls at oil giants - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/qzjvqwgnrvx/Majors%201%20aug%2020.PNG)

Of those five companies, only Exxon Mobil (N: ) did not book sizeable impairments. But an ongoing re-evaluation of its plans could lead to a ""significant portion"" of its assets being impaired, it reported, and signal the elimination of 20% or 4.4 billion barrels of its oil and gas reserves.

By contrast, BP (L: ) took a $17 billion hit. It said it plans to re-center its spending in coming years around renewables and less on oil and .

Weak demand means oil producers must revisit business plans, said Lee Maginniss, managing director at consultants Alarez & Marsal. He said the goal should be to pump only what generates cash in excess of overhead costs.

""It's low-cost production mode through the end of 2021 for sure, and to 2022 to the extent there are new development plans being contemplated,"" Maginniss said.

London-based BP has previously said it plans to cut its overall output by roughly 1 million barrels of oil equivalent (boepd) by the end of 2030 from its current 3.6 million boepd.

(GRAPHIC: Oil majors take massive asset hit - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jznvnkgzdpl/Majors%202%20aug%2020.PNG)

Of the five, Exxon is the largest producer, with daily output of 3.64 million boepd, but its production dropped 408,000 boepd between the first and second quarters. The five majors, which include Chevron Corp (N: ), Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Total SA (PA: ), also cut capital expenditures by a combined $25 billion between the quarters.

Crude output worldwide dropped sharply after the market crashed in April. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, along with allies including Russia, agreed to cut output by nearly 10 million barrels a day to balance out supply and demand in the market.

The dramatic reductions in asset valuations and decline in output show the depth of the pain in the second quarter. Fuel demand at one point was down by more than 30% worldwide, and still remains below pre-pandemic levels.

Several executives said they took massive writedowns because they expect demand to remain impaired for several more quarters as people travel less and use less fuel due to the ongoing global pandemic that has killed more than 700,000 people.

Of those five companies, only Exxon Mobil (N: ) did not book sizeable impairments. But an ongoing re-evaluation of its plans could lead to a ""significant portion"" of its assets being impaired, it reported, and signal the elimination of 20% or 4.4 billion barrels of its oil and gas reserves.

By contrast, BP (L: ) took a $17 billion hit. It said it plans to re-center its spending in coming years around renewables and less on oil and .

Weak demand means oil producers must revisit business plans, said Lee Maginniss, managing director at consultants Alarez & Marsal. He said the goal should be to pump only what generates cash in excess of overhead costs.

""It's low-cost production mode through the end of 2021 for sure, and to 2022 to the extent there are new development plans being contemplated,"" Maginniss said.

London-based BP has previously said it plans to cut its overall output by roughly 1 million barrels of oil equivalent (boepd) by the end of 2030 from its current 3.6 million boepd.

(GRAPHIC: Oil majors take massive asset hit - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jznvnkgzdpl/Majors%202%20aug%2020.PNG)

Of the five, Exxon is the largest producer, with daily output of 3.64 million boepd, but its production dropped 408,000 boepd between the first and second quarters. The five majors, which include Chevron Corp (N: ), Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Total SA (PA: ), also cut capital expenditures by a combined $25 billion between the quarters.

Crude output worldwide dropped sharply after the market crashed in April. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, along with allies including Russia, agreed to cut output by nearly 10 million barrels a day to balance out supply and demand in the market.

DUBAI (Reuters) - State oil giant Saudi Aramco 's (SE: ) profit plunged 73% in the second quarter of the year, as a slump in energy demand and prices due to the coronavirus crisis hit sales at the world's biggest oil exporter.

But the company stuck with plans to pay $75 billion (57.5 billion pounds) in dividends this year and CEO Amin Nasser said global oil demand was recovering.

All major oil companies have taken a hit in the second quarter as lockdowns to contain the coronavirus limited travel, which reduced oil consumption and sent prices ( ) tumbling to levels not seen in nearly two decades.

Aramco, which listed in Riyadh last year in a record $29.4 billion flotation, said the rapid spread of COVID-19 globally had significantly reduced demand for , and petroleum products.

Nasser told reporters he had seen a partial recovery in the energy market and a pick up in demand as economies gradually open after the easing of coronavirus lockdowns.

""Look at China, their gasoline and diesel demand is almost at pre-COVID 19 levels. We are seeing that Asia is picking up and other markets (too),"" he told reporters after announcing the company's quarterly results.

""As countries ease the lockdown, we expect the demand to increase.""

Nasser said Aramco was committed to its 2020 dividend.

""We intend to pay the $75 billion, subject to board approval and market conditions,"" he said.

The group's dividends play a critical role in helping the Saudi government to manage its fiscal deficit.

Aramco reported a 73.4% fall in second-quarter net profit, a steeper drop than analysts had forecast, and said it expected capital expenditure for 2020 to be at the lower end of a $25 billion to $30 billion range.

Net profit fell to 24.6 billion riyals ($6.57 billion) for the quarter to June 30 from 92.6 billion riyals a year earlier.

Analysts had expected net profit of 31.3 billion riyals, according to the mean estimate from three analysts, provided by Refinitiv.

""Aramco figures are healthy compared to other global peers,"" Mazen al-Sudairi, head of research at Al Rajhi Capital, said. ""This was the worst quarter in the modern history of oil industry, and surviving it with healthy figures points to a very positive outlook.""

Aramco shares were up about 0.4% in early trade. The group is currently the world's second most valuable publicly traded company after Apple (O: ).

Aramco said it will pay a dividend of $18.75 billion for the second quarter of this year, in line with plans for a $75 billion dividend for 2020.

BP (L: ) earlier this month cut its dividend for the first time in a decade after a record second-quarter loss, while Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) in April cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two.

Aramco's free cash flow stood at $6.1 billion in the second quarter and $21.1 billion for the first half of 2020, respectively, compared with $20.6 billion and $38.0 billion for the same periods in 2019.

Aramco's gearing ratio was 20.1% at the end of June, mainly reflecting the deferred consideration for the acquisition of Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SE: ) and the consolidation of SABIC’s net debt on to Aramco’s balance sheet.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/saudi-aramcos-secondquarter-net-profit-plunges-734-on-lower-oil-prices-2184586,0.082,0.813,0.105,0.9715

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (LON: ) cut its dividend for the first time in a decade after a record $6.7 billion (5.1 billion pounds) second-quarter loss, when the coronavirus crisis hammered fuel demand, and it sought to win over investors by speeding up its reinvention as a lower carbon company.

Its shares closed 6.5% higher on Tuesday after BP unveiled earlier than expected a plan to reduce its oil and gas output by 40% and boost investments in renewable energy, such as wind and solar, over the next decade.

All major oil companies suffered in the second quarter as lockdowns to contain the new coronavirus limited travel and oil prices fell to their lowest in two decades.

Several, including Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Norway's Equinor, cut their dividend in response.

BP CEO Bernard Looney, who took the helm in February, avoided a dividend cut in the first quarter despite worsening market conditions and as rivals reduced their payouts.

But Tuesday's 50% cut by BP to 5.25 cents per share, which was larger than the 40% forecast by analysts, became inevitable given a large debt pile, the collapse in oil and gas demand and growing expectations for a sluggish global economic recovery.

BP's net loss was in line with analysts' expectations and was largely a result of the company's decision to wipe $6.5 billion off the value of oil and gas exploration assets after it revised its price forecasts.

BP recorded total impairments of $17.4 billion, at the upper end of its previous guidance.

""These headline results have been driven by another very challenging quarter, but also by the deliberate steps we have taken as we continue to re-imagine energy and reinvent BP,"" Looney said in a statement.

""In particular, our reset of long-term price assumptions and the related impairment and exploration write-off charges had a major impact.""

The loss, based on BP's current accounting definition, is the first recorded on Refinitiv Eikon data. Looney called it the ""toughest quarter in the industry's history"".

GREEN SHOOTS?

As the investment climate turns away from carbon-intensive fossil fuel, Looney had planned to unveil BP's new strategy in September. Instead, the company announced details on Tuesday.

It said it would increase its low-carbon spending ten-fold by 2030 versus current levels to $5 billion a year out of a total budget of around $15 billion and boost its renewable power generation to 50 gigawatts.

Over the same timeframe, it plans to shrink its oil and gas production by at least 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with 2019.

Italy's Eni, which has also outlined an ambitious energy transition plan, said earlier this year it will wind down its oil and gas production starting 2025.[

To hone its portfolio, BP targets divestments of $25 billion between 2020 and 2025, around $12 billion of which are already lined up.

It will retain its 19.75% stake in Russia's Rosneft, it said.

While oil and gas are dominant, Redburn's equity analyst Stuart Joyner said the strategic shift was encouraging.

""There will be inevitable questions over profitability of new low carbon investments,"" he said. ""But BP is now firmly leading the sector in terms of transitioning its business to a lower carbon future.""

DEBT AND DIVIDEND

BP, which paid out a total of $7.2 billion in dividends last year, became the largest dividend payer on the London stock exchange after Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend for the first time since the 1940 earlier this year.

BP last reduced its dividend in 2010, when it was suspended for three quarters following the deadly Deepwater Horizon rig explosion.

It holds $40.9 billion in net debt after raising $19 billion in new debt in the second quarter, more than any of its peers.

Its debt-to-equity ratio, known as gearing, at 33.1% exceeds its own target and places it at risk of a downgrade by rating agencies.

BP said it aimed to ""reset a resilient dividend"" of 5.25 cents per share per quarter and to return at least 60% of future surplus cash as share buybacks.

BP's second-quarter underlying replacement cost loss, the company's definition of net income, reached $6.7 billion, roughly in line with forecasts.

That compared with profits of $2.8 billion a year earlier and $791 million in the first quarter of 2020.

Excluding the impairment charges, the sharp drop in revenue from BP's oil and gas production and the worst refining profit margins in 15 years were offset by an ""exceptionally strong contribution"" by trading operations.

Smiliarly, Shell and Total's results were cushioned from the full force of the coronavirus-induced demand collapse.

But U.S. rivals Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) and Chevron (NYSE: ), which have much smaller trading desks, suffered huge losses in the quarter.

BP said it expects global demand to recover in the third quarter, ""albeit still significantly below last year's levels.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/bp-cuts-dividend-after-record-loss-in-second-quarter-2179118,0.106,0.819,0.075,-0.9755

BP shares: 3 reasons I’ll avoid them

BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Following in the footsteps of its rival Shell (LON: ), BP (LSE: LON: ) has now had to cut its dividend. It was a move widely expected, but that will be little comfort to investors, especially those looking for income. BP last reduced its dividend in 2010, when it was suspended for three quarters following the deadly Deepwater Horizon rig explosion.

The latest from BP Alongside the dividend cut, BP also posted a $6.7bn quarterly loss after the coronavirus pandemic hit global demand for oil.

Funnily enough, the bad news led to the shares rising on the day of the announcement. I expect though that the rise is a temporary reprieve. I believe the shares are likely to keep heading down. That’s one reason why I’ll be avoiding BP shares.

Why BP shares could go lower BP shares and BP as a company are reliant on the oil price. That in turn is reliant on OPEC, which we’ve seen this year already is prone to internal disagreements that can massively impact the oil price. This lack of pricing control, I think, is a massive risk for BP.

Even a move away from oil won’t be easy. BP has said it would increase its low-carbon spending tenfold by 2030, versus current levels, to $5bn a year. That’s out of a total budget of around $15bn. And it will boost its renewable power generation to 50 gigawatts.

Over the next decade, BP forecasts that oil and gas production will fall by at least a million barrels of oil a day, or 40% compared to 2019. It plans to invest in renewables and bioenergy, as well as hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage technology.

This all costs money. Capital expenditure (capex) will remain high for a long time to come, which will keep a check on dividend growth, another reason I’ll avoid the shares.

And my third reason? BP’s huge debt should also hold back dividend growth. Even in an industry where debt is usual, BP’s seems extraordinarily high. It holds $40.9bn in net debt after raising $19bn in new debt in the second quarter.

Final word on BP shares Many will argue that the shares are now too cheap on a trailing P/E of 18 and with the share price down around 42% over the last 12 months. Bulls can point to a recovering economy in China and potentially in other parts of the world as reasons for optimism. I’m not convinced.

In the short term, maybe BP shares will recover. Especially now some of the expected bad news is out of the way. However, longer term I see little attraction. Even more so now the dividend is significantly lower.

I know I’ll be staying well clear of oil shares generally and as far away as I can from BP shares. The company has a problem with its debt and isn’t making the strides towards renewables that other energy companies are. I think it may be addicted to black gold, despite its new plans. The problem is its customers are becoming less and less addicted.

(Bloomberg) -- In the late 1990s, BP (NYSE: ) Plc boss John Browne used an oil-price slump to usher in the age of the supermajor, buying U.S. rivals Amoco and Arco to create a transatlantic giant. He kicked off a round of mergers that saw his company and four others dominate the industry -- Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ) in the U.S., Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Total SA (NYSE: ) in Europe.

That era ended on Tuesday when Bernard Looney, the third chief executive officer since Browne’s swashbuckling reign ended in 2007, declared BP would be a supermajor no more and proposed a very different blueprint for the oil company of the future.

Just six months after taking the helm, Looney has put meat on the bones of his plans to make BP compliant with the Paris accord on climate change, saying he’ll cut dividends in half, shrink oil and gas output by 40% over the next decade and spend as much as $5 billion a year building one of the world’s largest renewable-power businesses.

Where Browne created a global model, Looney’s strategy shows the oil industry is splitting in two.

On one side of the Atlantic, BP, Shell and Total are trying to make themselves going concerns for a low-carbon age, diluting their fossil-fuel businesses with plans to build significant revenues from renewable energy. Exxon and Chevron -- insulated from the pressure applied by European investors and politicians -- are charting a different course: keep pumping as profitably as possible and hand the cash back to investors. Like Big Tobacco, they’re increasingly courting shareholders willing to put returns above the harm their product causes.

Pay Out or Diversify

“BP had two choices,” said Brian Scott-Quinn, emeritus professor at Henley Business School in southern England, who’s written on financial markets and climate change. “First, simply paying out the maximum dividend it can in the future by not investing in the future at all. Alternatively, it can diversify on a much larger scale.”

Looney described his seismic shift as making an integrated oil company into an integrated energy company.

“You have to knit together lots of different energy sources,” Looney said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Wednesday. “We are , we’re in solar, we’re in wind, we have one of the world’s largest trading organizations.”

It’s a complete change of direction for a company that raised the dividend as recently as January and has been hammered by the post-pandemic crash in oil prices. And there are plenty of risks ahead.

BP concedes that power projects still make lower returns than oil and gas investments -- one reason why the board agreed to a lower dividend. And management has acknowledged that hydrocarbon production will probably remain BP’s main source of earnings for “the next several years,” funding its shift toward cleaner energy.

It’s also unclear what competitive advantage an oil company brings to building wind farms and solar parks; traditional power utilities have had a long head-start.

But there are dangers for Exxon and Chevron too. As alarm over global warming increases, their universe of potential investors may keep shrinking, especially if Joe Biden takes the White House in November and resets U.S. energy policy. As this quarter’s record losses show, if the post-Covid slump in crude prices is sustained, generating meaningful returns from oil and gas won’t be easy. A decade ago, Exxon was the most valuable U.S. corporation. Today it ranks 41st.

“There’s definitely a division between the Europeans, who are much more committed to meeting the climate agenda,” and the Americans, said Panmure Gordon & Co. analyst Colin Smith. Their success will depend on how attractive the pivot in investments is perceived to be, relative to continued spending on oil and gas, he said.

Unlike their European peers, Exxon and Chevron have managed to bat away investor pressure thus far. Both companies, backed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have resisted requests for shareholders to vote on their emission strategies.

But they’ve been struggling with meager returns after investing heavily in megaprojects around the world for a decade, leaving them wholly unprepared for the era of cheap oil that began in 2014. Slow to realize the transformational effect of the shale revolution that happened on their doorstep, Exxon and Chevron are only now understanding that they must become more nimble to respond to market conditions, rather than dictate them.

Sticking With Oil

Under their current CEOs, neither U.S. major has the will to follow the Europeans down the green path. Both plan to stick with oil and gas long-term, tempered only by small clean-energy technology bets. For them, rushing to renewables -- where they have no competitive advantage and see smaller returns in a more regulated industry -- is not the answer.

Yet in Europe, BP’s newly fleshed out plans will no doubt add pressure on Shell, which also announced ambitions earlier this year to slash its carbon emissions by 2050 and increasingly turn to renewables. The Anglo-Dutch major has promised more detail on that shift, which will ultimately result in it only doing business with emission-free companies.

For the European majors, the success of their strategy depends in part on governments maintaining the scale of policy support needed to make the energy transition happen. With countries around the world pledging greener economies as they emerge from the devastation of the coronavirus, BP may have chosen its moment wisely.

“If ever there was a moment to reset, this was it,” said Luke Parker, vice president of corporate analysis at consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Several factors have converged to make it possible: coronavirus and everything that comes with it; a strategic pivot to net-zero on the horizon” and a “new leadership with credit in the bank.”

(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). warned that low energy prices may wipe as much as one-fifth of its oil and reserves off the books.

If depressed prices persist for the rest of the year, “certain quantities of , bitumen and natural gas will not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2020,” the company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. A 20% hit would impact the equivalent of almost 4.5 billion barrels of crude, or enough to supply every refinery on the U.S. Gulf Coast for 18 months.

Exxon’s shares gave up some gains, trading 0.3% higher at 1:34 p.m., after earlier climbing as much as 1.9%, bolstered by a gain in international crude futures.

Rivals Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, BP (NYSE: ) Plc and Total SE have written off billions of dollars in reserves in recent weeks as the pandemic destroyed oil demand and prices, making some fields unprofitable to drill. Exxon has been the sole holdout, having not written down anything during the current crisis.

Exxon’s last significant reserves revision was in 2016, when it removed some of its oil-sands assets in Canada from its books, though it later added some of these back.

Exxon is currently undergoing its annual “very rigorous” process of reviewing the value of assets and should present the results to the board by November, Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said during a call with analysts July 31. While Exxon doesn’t publish commodity price forecasts, unlike European peers, Chapman said they’re “consistent with the range of third-party estimates.”

The stock market crash of 2020 is far from over, I think. Although some UK shares have surged to record highs, some look cheap now. I’d probably buy them.

Stock market crash The coronavirus has led to consequences for the UK’s economy that we’ve never seen before. The GDP fall, the rising unemployment rate, and low consumer demand are just some of the problems we face. But some industries have suffered more than others. Among them are the tourist sector, the oil companies, and the financials.

Many analysts reckon it will take these sectors several years to return to normal. It’s especially true of the tourist industry – the airlines and the cruise companies, for example. Although I consider myself to be a risk-averse investor, I’d still be willing to invest some money in the ‘big guys’ operating in these sectors. Here are some UK shares that I am considering.

Carnival (NYSE: ) Corporation – cheap UK shares We all remember the Diamond Princess incident, when thousands of passengers got stuck on the board the cruise ship. Well, the ship was owned by Carnival Corporation, the world’s largest cruise company. Since then the tourist industry has been a disaster. Cruise ships still have plenty of cash expenses, even when they are not operating tours, including servicing and repairs. At the same time, the demand for cruises is now historically low. So, the company ended up reporting losses this year and had to cancel its dividends. But I am sure that this ‘this too shall pass’ and brave investors will eventually get rewarded.

HSBC – a buy at current levels? This large well-established bank has suffered from the financials sector’s overall weakness since the beginning of the pandemic. What’s, the escalating tensions between the US and China are a threat to this Hong Kong bank. But its problems had started long before that. The thing is that Asia is HSBC‘s main source of revenue and profits. Operations in Europe and the US have always been quite costly to the bank. So, even before the March stock market crash, HSBC tried to cut costs by closing some of its branches in the EU and the US, making employees redundant. It all sounds grim. But I believe the bank will survive and flourish after the recession.

Buy Shell (LON: ) after the crash? The oil industry was also badly hurt as a result of the pandemic. The oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia also made oil futures turn negative this spring. This made all the oil companies struggle. But Shell and BP (LON: ) are the largest companies and are well-suited to survive the current crisis. However, Shell has a lower debt load than BP.

This is what I’d do Surely, the risks of investing in businesses that aren’t currently profitable are substantial. But the companies I’ve just mentioned are really big. So, I think they’ll be the first to benefit from economic recovery. Patience and willingness to buy when most other investors are scared to is a good way to get rich and retire early. At the same time, I’d only invest quite a small sum of money in these companies.

(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s volatility speculators are staring down one of the most confounding trading landscapes in years, even as bullish conviction pushes U.S. stocks back toward records.

On the one hand, equities are in their historically most volatile month, U.S. election risk remains elevated and the pandemic fallout continues. All of which suggest gains for investors betting on rockier markets, and risks for those shorting.

On the other, a manic season for corporate earnings is fading, historical swings on the S&P 500 are easing and technicals haven’t looked this inviting since 2012. With the Cboe Volatility Index, or , sitting at its post-pandemic low, money managers may be tempted to bet on further tranquility. Yet there are few signs of strong conviction out there.

“This environment is, and has been, attractive for shorting equity volatility,” said Colton Loder, managing principal of Cohalo, an alternative investment firm. But, “there doesn’t appear to be a massive rush yet from what we can see,” added the Washington-based manager.

One indicator is that speculative short positions in VIX futures remain subdued, and have increased lately only in tandem with commercial longs. The metric doesn’t take into account those either selling options or betting in the over-the-counter market. But the lack of activity here could suggest traders are lacking strong conviction on shorting volatility even with one of the most promising market set-ups in years.

On the latter, take a look at one corner of the VIX landscape. Thanks in large part to heightened jitters around the U.S. presidential election, volatility futures several months out on the curve are trading at an outsize premium to near-term contracts, a condition known as contango.

The generic second-month VIX contract was 2.6 points higher than the front-month contract Monday -- near the largest gap in eight years. Since futures will converge to spot VIX at expiry, selling the contracts has typically delivered gains in a trade known as the rolldown. That’s especially when the curve has looked this upward sloping.

In a note Tuesday citing the shape of the curve, BNP Paribas (OTC: ) SA strategists wrote “there looks to be plenty of opportunity to trade rolldown.”

But what looks like an inviting shape to short-sellers may ultimately prove deceptive, suggests Vance Harwood of Six Figure Investing.“Normally this level of steepness in front months would indicate an ‘all is well’ market but this market is anticipating volatility associated with the election,” Harwood wrote on Twitter.

In other words, the VIX could remain elevated or even rise as the election draws nearer, confounding short bets.

Still, over at trading firm Susquehanna, Chris Murphy notes that realized swings for the S&P 500 Index have been relatively tranquil of late, which can have a dulling effect on the VIX, a forecast of future moves. He reckons a pandemic-lashed earnings season will soon be in the rearview mirror, a potential slam-dunk for shorts.

But there are plenty of reasons for caution. Beside the heightened risk around the election, there’s the potential for more bad news on the virus, steep valuations for tech leaders and haggling over U.S. stimulus.

“Volatility traders are likely short to capture the roll yield,” said Mike Shell (LON: ), founder of Shell Capital Management LLC. But “I would not be short volatility right now.”

Investing.com -- Rhetoric surrounding the potential purchase of TikTok has become heated with President Trump claiming the U.S. government wants its share, while the World Health Organisation expressed doubts about the possibility of a vaccine for the Covid-19 virus. Wall Street is set for a negative start, while Apple (NASDAQ: ) is one the verge of another record. BP (NYSE: ) and Nikola (NASDAQ: ) are other stocks to focus on at the start of trading Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, August 4th.

1. Rhetoric surrounding TikTok becomes toxic

The tone of the conversation surrounding the potential purchase of Tik Tok’s U.S. operations by Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) is becoming more and more belligerent, with the move threatening to become the precursor to a larger tech war.

Microsoft said on Monday it was in talks -- reports Tuesday suggested there are other interested parties -- with ByteDance to buy parts of TikTok after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed course on a plan to ban the video-sharing app on national security grounds and gave the firms 45 days to strike a deal.

President Trump also noted Monday that the U.S. government should get a ""substantial"" cut of the sales price of the U.S. operations of the company, although it’s unclear how that would occur.

This prompted a scathing response in the state-backed China Daily newspaper, with its editorial saying that China will not accept the ""theft"" of a Chinese technology company.

It added that the United States' ""bullying"" of Chinese tech companies was a consequence of Washington's zero-sum vision of ""American first"" and left China no choice but ""submission or mortal combat in the tech realm"", and that China had ""plenty of ways to respond if the administration carries out its planned smash and grab.”

It’s unclear what moves China has to respond, but watch this space.

2. Covid-19 “silver bullet” may never happen - WHO

The Covid-19 outbreak is showing signs of stalling in the U.S., with new cases falling below 50,000 for the second day in a row and the number of deaths dropping below one thousand a day.

That said, the U.S. government's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, on Monday said states with high coronavirus case counts should reconsider imposing lockdown restrictions, emphasizing the need to get cases to a low baseline before the fall flu season.

Additionally, senior figures at the World Health Organization warned on Monday that the road to normality would be long, and countries had to accept there might never be a ""silver bullet"" for Covid-19 in the form of a perfect vaccine.

""A number of vaccines are now in phase three clinical trials and we all hope to have a number of effective vaccines that can help prevent people from infection. However, there's no silver bullet at the moment - and there might never be,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Monday.

Elsewhere, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned earlier Tuesday that the world faces a ""generational catastrophe"" because of school closures amid the coronavirus pandemic and said that getting students safely back to the classroom must be ""a top priority.""

3. Apple helps tech sector soar

U.S. stock markets are seen opening a touch lower Tuesday, consolidating after more strong gains Monday, led by the tech-heavy which posted another record close.

By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the contract was down 44 points or 0.2%, while the contract was down 0.3% and the contract was 0.3% lower.

Apple set an all-time high Monday, and the iPhone maker is now a few share points away from registering a two trillion dollar market capitalization. The share price to look out for is $467.77, before the company undergoes a 4-for-1 share split, compared with Monday’s $435.75 closing level.

Helping the tone were reports the White House was considering acting on its own to boost unemployment benefits, with the stalemate in Washington meaning many citizens are currently missing out on $600 a week payments.

This indicates many investors are waiting on news from Washington, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated that talks on Monday on a new virus relief package yielded “a little bit” of progress.

4. BP continues Big Oil’s tale of woe

BP cut its dividend for the first time in a decade Tuesday, to 5.25 cents per share, continuing the string of weak results from the oil sector as the coronavirus pandemic weighed heavily.

The British oil giant said it lost $16.8 billion in the second quarter after taking a charge of $10.9 billion, mostly for writing down the value of various projects after the steep fall in oil prices. Its underlying replacement cost loss was $6.7 billion, compared with a profit of $2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter.

The one saving grace for the company was its trading division, which delivered an “exceptionally strong result,” BP said.

European rivals Total, Shell (LON: ) and Equinor have also all reported healthy trading gains, helping their bottom lines in these difficult times, while American counterparts Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) and Chevron (NYSE: ), which are not as robust with their trading, posted their worst set of quarterly results of the modern era.

5. Electric vehicle sector also includes Nikola

The U.S. earnings season continues Tuesday, and one company that may be in the spotlight Tuesday is Nikola which releases its second quarter numbers.

While Tesla (NASDAQ: ) has taken most of the limelight in the electric vehicle sector, Deutsche Bank (DE: ) said in a note on Monday that the electric truck maker could be worth a buy ahead of its latest update. Among the things investors are hoping to learn more about are the customer pipeline for Nikola's electric semi, its plans to build a hydrogen refueling network, and a manufacturing partner for its Badger pickup truck, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner.

Nikola stock is up 11% this week, but down over 36% this month.",https://uk.investing.com//news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-tuesday-august-4th-2179349,0.078,0.824,0.097,0.9765

2/2 © Bloomberg. A BP Plc logo sits at the top of a totem sign at a filling station in London, U.K., on Monday, June 8, 2020. BP Plc plans to cut 10,000 jobs as the coronavirus pandemic accelerates the company's move to slim down for the energy transition. 2/2

(Bloomberg) -- BP (NYSE: ) Plc cut its dividend for the first time in a decade, removing a cornerstone of its investment case after the coronavirus pandemic upended almost every aspect of its business.

The move was largely expected after European peer Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc slashed its own dividend in April. While Big Oil’s generous payouts have long been its main attraction to investors, the unprecedented market turmoil wrought by the virus has forced companies to take decisions unthinkable before this year.

BP also announced a new strategy to deliver its “net-zero” ambition, targeting a 10-fold increase in low-carbon investment by 2030 and a 30%-35% decline in emissions from its operations by that year.

The company reported an adjusted net loss of $6.68 billion for the second quarter, following a $2.81 billion profit a year earlier. Analysts had estimated a loss of $8.45 billion. It cut its dividend to 5.25 cents a share.

BP had raised its payout in the fourth quarter to 10.5 cents a share, in the final set of results for outgoing Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley. But as the coronavirus spread across the world, destroying demand and hammering oil prices, the $8 billion annual payout had looked increasingly shaky.

Virtually every part of BP’s business, from its forecourts to its oil and gas production, was hit by the pandemic’s devastating impact on fuel consumption. But there was one bright spot: oil trading delivered an “exceptionally strong result,” BP said.

The oil major’s sprawling trading unit capitalized on the period’s volatility and in particular made money from so-called contango plays. That trade involves putting cheap oil into storage and simultaneously selling it at higher prices on the forward market. Total SE, Shell and Equinor ASA (NYSE: ) all reaped the benefits of contango, with trading gains saving them from a quarterly loss.

American counterparts Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ), which have a more timid approach to trading, posted their worst set of quarterly results of the modern era.

2020 has proved a dangerous time to buy into some of the biggest UK shares like Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and BP (LSE: LON: ) I’ve long argued that buying BP shares is too risky, in spite of its mighty dividend yields. And today the oilie proved exactly why.

The colossus decided not to cut dividends earlier this year in response to the crashing price. But on Tuesday, BP was forced to follow Shell’s April decision and hack back the shareholder reward. It will be cutting the second quarter dividend to 5.25 US cents per share, it said, halving it from the 10.5 cents it shelled out a year ago.

The move’s been prompted by some truly shocking financials that showed BP swung to an underlying replacement cost loss of $6.7bn in the second quarter. This compares with a profit of $2.8bn printed in the same 2019 quarter. The reason for the deterioration? BP booked a whopping $6.5bn worth of write-downs as it marked down its oil and gas forecasts.

BP is the latest dividend slasher This is the first time that BP has cut dividends for around a decade and is the latest in a flow of dividend cuts that owners of UK shares have had to stomach. More than half of all FTSE 100 companies have either cut, suspended or axed their dividends in 2020. And more could be coming as the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic rolls on.

I’m certainly not expecting BP to re-emerge as a generous dividend payer any time soon. The oilie said today that it would “pivot” from being an international oil producer to an integrated energy company. Still, the business of drawing oil from the ground will remain BP’s bread and butter for a long, long time yet. And consequently it faces prolonged earnings pressure as the economic downturn dents energy demand; massive fossil fuel investment in major-producing nations drives new supply; and growing stacks of ‘green’ legislation damage oil and gas consumption.

I’d still buy UK shares for big dividends So 2020 has been an awful year for dividend investors. But it’s not to say that there are no longer any top-quality income UK shares to buy right now. You just need to know where to look.

For instance, I’d be very happy to buy shares in National Grid (LON: ) right now. This FTSE 100 energy giant has a monopoly on keeping Britain’s electricity grid up and running. And it’s a role that provides exceptional earnings visibility, economic downturn or not. National Grid isn’t likely to cut dividends any time soon and this means that its 5.5% is rock solid.

So don’t be spooked by BP’s groundshaking dividend cut. There are still plenty of brilliant dividend stocks like National Grid that can help you make stunning shareholder returns now and in the future. And The Motley Fool’s massive library of articles and reports can help you find them and maybe get rich in the process.

Dividend-hungry investors who are in despair after today’s BP (LON: ) dividend cut should take heart because plenty of companies still offer fantastic yields. You can get income of up to 11% without taking unnecessary risks with your money.

The news will come as a huge relief after energy giant BP became the latest UK blue chip to take an axe to its shareholder payouts. Plenty of top FTSE 100 companies are standing by their dividends, even as BP cuts.

There is no question that UK dividends are now thinner on the ground, thanks to the Covid-19-related downturn. An incredible 176 UK companies have cancelled dividends and another 30 reduced theirs in the three months to 30 June, according to the latest Dividend Monitor from Link Group.

FTSE income squeeze Headline dividends could halve this year, in the group’s worst-case scenario, costing investors an incredible £53.8bn. Companies have been forced into taking drastic action, to protect their balance sheets during the sharpest recession in history.

All of the big banks have been forced to drop their dividends. That means Barclays (LON: ), Lloyds Banking Group (LON: ), HSBC Holdings (LON: ), NatWest Group, and Standard Chartered (LON: ) pay no dividends at all right now. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) has axed its prized payout for the first time since the war, while insurer Aviva (LON: ), broadcaster ITV (LON: ), Costa Coffee owner Whitbread (LON: ) and telecoms provider BT Group (LON: ) have scrapped theirs.

Link’s research shows that 60 UK companies did increase their payouts in the second quarter. That is pretty impressive, given the economic challenges that lie ahead. There are still plenty of income opportunities out there, despite the BP dividend cut.

Right now, Standard Life (LON: ) Aberdeen and Legal & General Group (LON: ) both yield more than 8% a year. Phoenix Group Holdings yields 6.96% and Vodafone Group (LON: ) gives you 6.68%.

Big tobacco is also a great source of dividends, with British American Tobacco (LON: ) yielding 8% and Imperial Brands (LON: ) Group an incredible 11%. Healthcare companies GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca have been two great stocks to hold during the global pandemic, and currently yield 5.09% and 2.55% respectively.

Look beyond the BP dividend cut Experienced investors will know the value of holding defensive utility stocks at times like these. National Grid (LON: ), a sector favourite of mine, yields 5.31%. United Utilities Group is close behind, yielding 4.68%. SSE (LON: ) yields a whopping 6.09%.

There are plenty more top dividend payers there. They include mining giant Rio Tinto (LON: ), which yields 6.33%, Tesco‘s 4.14%, and Diageo‘s 2.51%.

Despite the BP dividend cut, it remains a top income stock. Even now you will get a very welcome 5.4% a year. No wonder its share price actually jumped on the news.

The bulk of the FTSE 100 dividend cuts should be over for now. Companies that are standing by their dividend can probably afford to do so. In today’s troubled market, it pays to choose your income stocks carefully, rather than buying the whole index.

As you can see, the BP dividend cut is not the end of the world. The income is still out there.

FTSE 100 dividends aren’t dying or dead. I’d buy this bumper payout today!

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BATS -2.54% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio RIO -0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio FTMC -0.21% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

For FTSE 100 investors, 2020 has been a horrible year. Not only has the main market index fallen steeply, but many of its members have suspended, cut, or cancelled their dividends.

The FTSE 100 takes a beating Since the start of 2020, the has dived by roughly 1,625 points to 5,980 today. That’s a decline of more than a fifth (21.4%) in seven months.

Things were far worse back in the spring, when the FTSE 100 crashed to its 2020 low below 5,000 on 23 March. The culprit, of course, was the rapidly spreading coronavirus, which led to lockdowns around the globe.

UK dividends crash With some businesses completely deprived of revenues, and others facing extreme uncertainty, companies tried to conserve cash. Redundancies and cost-cutting followed, while many FTSE 100 members took an axe to their regular cash dividends.

Indeed, UK dividends collapsed by 57% in Q2 and will fall by at least two-fifths in 2020, according to the latest UK Dividend Monitor (PDF) from Link Asset Services.

According to Link, 176 UK-listed companies cancelled dividend payouts and 30 more cut them. Together, these represent three-quarters of usual second-quarter dividend payers. Just 61 increased their payouts.

As a result, dividends fell 57.2% to £16.1bn on a headline basis (or 50.2% to £16bn if special dividends are excluded). This was the lowest Q2 total since 2010 and the biggest yearly decline ever recorded by Link.

Link adds that Q2 dividends were down £22bn on a headline basis and £16.4bn on an underlying basis (excluding special dividends). These are huge sums for income-seeking investors and pension funds to lose.

The biggest-ever blow to dividends Within the FTSE 100, payouts fell 45% in Q2, versus 76% among mid-cap members. These falls are even worse than those caused by the global financial crisis, when two-fifths of companies cut or cancelled their payouts.

Looking ahead to 2020 as a whole, Link’s best-case scenario sees dividends falling 39% on an underlying basis to £60.5bn (from £98.5bn in 2019). Including special dividends, Link’s best-case basis expects total dividends to collapse by 45% to £61.6bn (from £110.5bn).

Link notes that this will be “the biggest hit to [FTSE 100] dividends in generations” and that “it could take until 2026 for dividends to return to their 2019 level.” Yikes.

The FTSE 100’s mega-dividends While some FTSE 100 companies were forced to axe their dividends, others did so out of prudence. Notably, banks and most insurers were ordered or urged by regulators to suspend or cancel dividends. Also, some – notably leading oil producers – have been accused of using Covid-19 as an excuse to reset unsustainably high dividends.

These were the FTSE 100’s five biggest dividend payers in Q2 (largest to smallest): Rio Tinto (LON: ), BP (LON: ), British American Tobacco (LON: ), GlaxoSmithKline, and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ). These five mega-caps collectively paid £5.8bn in Q2 dividends. That’s more than a third (36%) of all dividends paid by UK-listed companies.

The next 10 biggest FTSE 100 dividend giants paid out a further £4.8bn in dividends. Thus, the top 15 payers in the FTSE 100 accounted for £10.6bn in dividends. That’s two-thirds (66%) of the total paid by the entire London market. Wow.

I’d buy this FTSE 100 dividend dynamo I wouldn’t recommend building a portfolio consisting solely of these five FTSE 100 dividend dynamos. For the record, my pick of this crop would be pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK), for its 5.1% current dividend yield and future prospects. GSK has been a dividend darling of mine for almost 30 years and long may this continue!

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As U.S. lawmakers plot to stop one of Moscow's most important projects in Europe, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, lobbyists supporting it are busier than ever but disclosing few details of their work, according to government filings and current and former U.S. officials.

The pipeline linking Russian gas fields to Western Europe has become a lightning rod of contention in U.S.-Russia relations, with the Trump administration concerned it would dangerously expand the region’s energy dependence on Moscow but backers, including in Europe, saying the gas is needed.

U.S. President Donald Trump has already signed a sanctions bill that delayed construction on the $11 billion (8.41 billion pounds) project, wholly-owned by Russia's state-run Gazprom (MM: ) and headed by Alexei Miller, a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. But lawmakers fearful the measures are not enough to prevent the pipeline’s completion are contemplating further action.

Nord Stream 2 AG has paid lobbyists at BGR Group, Roberti Global LLC, and Sweeney & Associates a combined $1.69 million during the first half of this year, according to Senate records. That is more than double the amount during the same period a year ago, and more than all of 2018, the first full year the project lobbied in Washington.

But exactly who the lobbyists meet with is a mystery because they have not registered with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, a law passed in 1938 to limit the influence of Nazi Germany and Communist Russia in U.S. politics. Under FARA, lobbyists must disclose every meeting with U.S. officials, along with the materials they distribute.

Instead, the Nord Stream 2 lobbyists have registered under the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act, a law that amended FARA by allowing lobbyists for foreign companies or individuals to report much less information as long as their work is not intended to benefit a foreign government.

Representatives for Nord Stream 2 and the lobbying companies did not respond to requests for comment. But Nord Stream 2 has characterized itself as a commercial, not political, project.

A senior Trump administration official took issue with that, saying the lobbyists are seeking to further Moscow's national interests.

""The fact that you’ve got people working for Gazprom, which is essentially the Russian state, you know to manipulate our processes … it’s crazy,"" the official said, asking not to be named discussing the issue.

Danielle Nichols, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, which handles FARA registrations, said the department had no comment at this time.

Lobbyists for Nord Stream 2’s foreign opponents, by contrast, have registered under FARA. Yorktown Solutions LLC, for example, which lobbies for Ukraine's state-owned Naftogaz and its partner companies against the pipeline, is among them, according to FARA records.

Andriy Kobolyev, Naftogaz's chief executive told Reuters in an email that company representatives travel to Washington about once a month to provide updates on the status of Nord Stream 2 and discuss how to stop the pipeline.

Nord Stream 2 will double the capacity of an existing line to Germany under the Baltic Sea to 110 billion cubic meters of gas per year, enough to supply 26 million households. It would circumvent U.S. ally Ukraine, depriving it of potentially billions of dollars in transit fees, and compete with U.S. efforts to sell liquefied into Europe.

U.S. senators Ted Cruz, a Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, are among the pipeline’s biggest opponents in Congress and are pushing new sanctions measures that would target insurers of Gazprom vessels that would lay the last 100 miles (160 km) of pipe in Danish waters, where unexploded bombs from World War II lie in the pipeline’s path.

Neither senator responded to a request for comment.

Nord Stream 2 backers say Germany and other European countries need Russian gas, and Germany has threatened retaliatory action if U.S. sanctions stop the project.

(Bloomberg) -- As Bernard Looney took to the stage in London in February to announce his plan to transform BP (NYSE: ) Plc for a low-carbon future, the U.K. capital confirmed its first case of Covid-19.

The oil giant’s chief executive officer couldn’t have known how the virus would shake the foundations of his industry: since the start of the pandemic, BP has said it will write off as much as $17.5 billion of fossil-fuel assets, slash 10,000 jobs and exit the petrochemicals business. And on Tuesday, it may announce the first dividend cut since the Macondo oil-spill disaster a decade ago.

But despite the pain for shareholders and employees, the crisis is giving Looney the opportunity to accelerate the big changes needed to fulfill his vision.

The global spread of coronavirus “only reaffirms the need to reinvent our company,” Looney now says. The pandemic has created a world that pumps less oil, gets more of its energy from renewable sources and emits less carbon dioxide -- exactly what he says BP should do.

“This backdrop of battered demand presents a lot of challenges, but it also presents opportunity,” said Luke Parker, vice president of corporate research for Wood Mackenzie Ltd.

The measures BP has taken so far aren’t unique, either in the current slump or in the periodic downturns that have afflicted the industry over the decades. But there’s a symbolism that wasn’t there before.

Quitting a core business like chemicals is a good way to show that the future looks different. Taking an ax to billions of dollars of oil and gas asset values demonstrates that “you’re a company that believes this transition is going to happen and that the world will be on a 2-degree path,” Parker said.

Most importantly, the company is widely expected to follow Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc in the coming week by cutting its dividend, potentially freeing up cash to invest in clean energy.

Difficult decisions like this have been made easier by the coronavirus crisis, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) & Co.’s head of EMEA oil and gas, Christyan Malek.

“What you’re seeing BP do is getting its house in order” before announcing a detailed transformation plan in September, Malek said. “BP have been putting the building blocks in place -- the impairments, the divestments. And we believe the dividend cut is the next building block.”

Reducing BP’s $8 billion annual shareholder payout would address the biggest unanswered question about Looney’s transition plan: Where is the money going to come from?

Even before the coronavirus lockdowns crashed energy prices, BP was saddled with more debt than any of its peers. Its gearing -- the ratio of debt to equity -- is poised to rise as high as 48%, according to RBC Capital Markets. That would be by far the highest in the industry, and could lead to questions about its credit rating.

While the measures Looney has taken so far may help him achieve BP’s long-term goals, in the short-term shareholders appear unimpressed. The company’s stock is down 41% this year, a steeper drop than the 36% decline in the Oil & Gas index.

Low-Carbon Spending

Without a detailed plan of how BP is going to become a clean-energy giant, the cost of the transformation remains largely theoretical. What’s clear, is that at the very least the oil major will have to boost spending on low-carbon fuels significantly from the current $500 million a year to billions.

The other route would be acquisitions, following on from its 130 million-pound ($170 million) purchase of U.K. car-charging company Chargemaster in 2018. Such assets typically have positive cash flow and can be integrated easily into oil majors’ portfolios, said Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship, at Federated Hermes (NYSE: ).

As Looney, 49, reshapes BP, doubts linger about the strategy. Sitting in the audience of the great unveiling in February was former CEO John Browne, who tried to steer the company into renewables in the early 2000s with the ill-fated “Beyond Petroleum” campaign.

“We moved too soon,” Looney said in a recent Instagram post. “We lost money on much of what we had built up.”

Bob Dudley, Looney’s immediate predecessor, has repeatedly cautioned against moving too fast into low-carbon fuels, saying the potential failure of new technologies could lead to financial ruin.

The key to success will be keeping investors on board. There’s strong support for BP’s overall change in direction, with shareholders voting overwhelmingly in favor of climate resolutions in 2019, according to Hermes’ Duguid. But it could be a painful journey, and there’s a risk shareholders have a change of heart if Looney does cut the dividend.

“You can use the macroeconomic backdrop as a way to justify the means, but you still need the end result to work,” said JPMorgan’s Malek.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's anti-monopoly watchdog UOKiK said on Monday it had fined Gazprom 213 million zloty ($57 million/£43.44 million) (MM: ) over a lack of cooperation in its proceedings with regard to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.

Poland sees Nord Stream 2, which would double Russia's gas export capacity via the Baltic Sea, as a threat to Europe's energy security, saying it will strengthen Gazprom's market dominance.

Nord Stream 2 is led by Gazprom, with half of the funding provided by Germany's Uniper (DE: ) and BASF's (DE: ) Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch company Shell (L: ), Austria's OMV (VI: ) and Engie (PA: ).

UOKiK has been examining the project for years. In 2019 it fined Engie 40 million euros (36.06 million pounds) for failing to provide documents and information relating to the case.

""At the beginning of the year, we requested Gazprom provide us with contracts concluded by its subsidiary with other companies financing the construction of Nord Stream 2,"" the head of UOKiK said in a statement. ""The company failed to provide such information.""

""To my mind, it is an intentional act, the aim of which was to obstruct the ongoing proceedings.""

Gazprom said it had asked UOKiK to provide justification for that request, which it had not received. The Russian energy giant plans to appeal the fine in court, it said on Monday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Gazprom have said they plan to complete Nord Stream 2. More than 90% of the construction has been completed.

Gazprom supplies most of the gas consumed in Poland. Polish state-run gas company PGNiG (WA: ) has often complained it pays more than its European peers for Russian gas.

These 5 FTSE 100 shares pay out billions in cash every quarter. I’d love to own them!

One of the joys of owning shares, especially stocks, is the cash payouts (dividends) regularly paid to their shareholder owners.

The joy of FTSE 100 dividends For me, dividends also fundamentally undermine the claim that the stock market is a casino for gamblers. When I hear this, I quote legendary US fund manager Peter Lynch. He said, “A share is not a lottery ticket…it’s part-ownership of a business”.

For the record, the UK lottery pays out only half (50%) of ticket sales in prizes. In the gambling world, that’s known as a 50% ‘negative expectation’. Conversely, the regular cash dividends paid out to UK (mostly FTSE 100) shareholders last year totalled £110.5bn. That’s a near-5% positive yearly return (assuming no capital gains nor losses).

FTSE 100 dividends devastated So far, so good, but now for the bad news. This year, FTSE 100 dividends have been devastated thanks to Covid-19 and a lower oil price.

In the second quarter, FTSE 100 dividends crashed by 45%, and an even more drastic 76% for the . This is even worse than in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, when two-fifths of companies cut or cancelled their cash payouts.

For the second quarter of 2019, the top-five FTSE 100 dividend payers handed over £10.9bn in cash to their shareholders (page 9, PDF). These five dividend darlings accounted for almost three-tenths (29%) of all dividends paid by UK-listed companies in Q2/19. Wow.

In Q2/20, FTSE 100 dividends collapsed, with the top five paying out a mere £5.8bn, or 36% of all UK-listed company dividends. The year-on-year difference is £5.1bn, which is a huge body blow for income-seeking investors.

The five ‘big beasts’ for dividends Due to the coronavirus, we’re living in a weird world, where it’s difficult see beyond the economic havoc that the virus has inflicted. One day, the world will emerge from this crisis, growth will resume, and corporate profitability will rebound. Then FTSE 100 dividends will grow again, as they did every year from 2015 to 2019.

Currently, these are the five biggest beasts among FTSE 100 dividend payers (note that BP (LON: ) announced today that it would halve its dividend, but still yields almost 5.4% a year):

Rank | Company | Description | Market value

#1 | Rio Tinto (LON: ) | Global miner | £80.9bn

#2 | BP | Oil supermajor | £57.0bn

#3 | British American Tobacco (LON: ) | Tobacco | £57.9bn

#4 | GlaxoSmithKline | Pharma | £79.6bn

#5 | Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) | Oil supermajor | £98.3bn

As you can see, each of the FTSE 100’s big five is a mega-cap giant, and all are global leaders in their respective fields. Their sheer size and strength allow them to pay huge dividends, while still investing in and growing their businesses.

Decent dividends are the bedrock of portfolios Earlier this week, I wrote that I wouldn’t recommend building a portfolio from only five shares. That’s because a five-share portfolio doesn’t offer anywhere near enough diversification (especially for income seekers). Also, two of the five (BP and Shell) are in the same sector, further increasing concentration risk.

However, if forced to, I would put a fair chunk of money into these five dividend dynamos. After all, I’ve recommended all five separately to readers in recent weeks. And I estimate that this FTSE 100 mini-portfolio’s dividend yield would exceed 6%. That’s a much greater return than playing the lottery!

By Jennifer Hiller

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (N: ) on Friday reported an $8.3 billion (6.3 billion pounds) loss in the second quarter on asset writedowns from plummeting fuel prices, a forced exit from Venezuela and expenses tied to thousands of jobs cuts.

Multibillion-dollar asset writedowns have become a prominent part of second-quarter energy results as the COVID-19 pandemic crushed fuel demand and created a massive glut of supply worldwide.

But the writedowns also reflect a growing realization that a deepening economic downturn could depress energy prices for years. Chevron rivals Total (PA: ), Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), and Eni (MI: ) each wrote down billions of dollars in assets, while BP (L: ) has signaled an up to $17.5 billion hit.

Chevron wrote down its oil and gas production properties by $5.6 billion, including its entire investment in crisis-ravaged Venezuela, where it has been the last major U.S. oil company still operating. The Trump administration has directed it to wind down its business there.

The loss also includes $1 billion to cover severance pay for up to 6,700 of its 45,000-person staff to leave their jobs in a global restructuring.

Chief U.S. rival Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ) also posted a loss on Friday and said it was in the midst of reviewing operations, promising ""significant"" cost cuts.

The massive writedowns follow Chevron's $10 billion writedown of mostly properties in the fourth quarter of 2019.

The total value of U.S. goods and services produced last quarter fell at a 32.9% annual rate, the deepest decline in economic activity in modern history.

""It will take years for that to recover and the price for our products is tied to economic activity,"" said Pierre Breber, Chevron's finance chief, in an interview. The company plans to continue to restrain spending on new projects, he said.

Output last quarter fell by about 189,000 barrels of oil and gas per day compared with a year ago, reflecting its efforts to limit losses and earlier property sales.

The writedown of oil and gas properties included non-shale operations in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oilfield, offshore Gulf of Mexico fields, and undefined properties outside the United States, he said.

""We would need to see sustained economic recovery and much lower inventory levels before we would add capital back to the Permian or other basins,"" said Breber. ""We're in a lower for longer world where demand is down and there's ample supply.""

Chevron's cash flow from operations was negative $643 million in the quarter, ""and we expect this to weigh on shares in the near term,"" said analyst Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited.

Despite this, the company ""exited the worst quarter in recent history with a strong balance sheet and well-positioned to support its dividend even if the macro environment remains challenging,"" said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones.

The writedowns pushed Chevron's loss to $8.27 billion, or $4.44 a share, compared with a profit of $4.3 billion, or $2.27 a share, a year ago. Adjusted loss was $3 billion, or $1.59 per share, compared with a profit of $3.4 billion, or $1.77 per share, last year, it reported.

The loss reflects an average 65% reduction in the prices received for its petroleum produced last quarter as demand plummeted amid COVID-19 travel restrictions and declining industrial demand for fuels.

Pre-market trading in the company's stock was indicated 3.6% lower on Friday. It closed at $86.27 on Thursday, down 29% from the start of the year.

Chevron has resisted leaving Venezuela, arguing its presence was a stabilizing presence and supported local workers. Any exit would hand over its assets to Russian or Chinese oil companies, it has said. Chevron has operated in the country for nearly 100 years, mostly recently through joint ventures with Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.

But the Trump administration gave Chevron until December to wind down its business there amid U.S. sanctions designed to oust the government of President Nicolas Maduro. Chevron wrote off the $2.6 billion value of Venezuelan assets, which in June produced 7,000 barrels per day, Breber said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/chevron-posts-83-billion-secondquarter-loss-on-write-downs-job-cuts-2176858,0.083,0.829,0.088,0.6428

(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ) posted the worst losses in a generation after the pandemic and a global crude glut combined to batter almost every part of their businesses.

Exxon’s $1.1 billion second-quarter loss was the deepest in the company’s modern history. A collapse in crude prices bled the company’s production division while Covid-19 lockdowns lowered demand for everything from jet fuel to plastic wrap, hobbling the company’s refining and chemical units.

Chevron recorded its weakest performance in at least three decades and warned that the global pandemic wreaking havoc upon energy markets may continue to drag on earnings. Shares of both explorers declined in pre-market trading.

Oil has become the poorest-performing sector of U.S. equity markets as a confluence of economic, political and structural threats coalesce to imperil the very foundations of the petroleum industry. Sweeping layoffs, budget cuts and project cancellations haven’t been enough to arrest the industry’s decline as fleeing investors made energy the worst investment in the S&P 500 Index this year.

Without the massive trading operations that shielded European oil explorers such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Total SE from losses, Chevron was exposed to the full force of this year’s oil price rout. Notably, Exxon’s nascent trading foray “experienced unfavorable mark-to-market derivative impacts,” the company said.

Exxon fell 0.7% to $41.57 in pre-market trading. Chevron declined 3.3%.

The U.S. supermajors’ woes are emblematic of the broader threats menacing the petroleum industry in what is turning out to be the deepest crisis of its 161-year history. International titans that raked in record-breaking profits during the first decade of the century have now been reduced to widespread job cuts, belt tightening and heavy borrowing to cover dividends and other outlays.

Cost Cuts

Exxon, which earlier this year began taking efforts to reduce its U.S. workforce, said it’s developing plans to further curtail operating expenses, without providing details. The company’s 26-cents per-share loss was better than the 64-cent average loss from analysts in a Bloomberg survey.

The worst-ever crude crash came at a vulnerable time for Exxon because it had just embarked on an aggressive, multibillion-dollar rebuilding program. After slashing $10 billion in capital spending and freezing dividends, Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods may be running out of levers to pull.

On Friday, Woods said that, based on current projections, the company won’t take on any additional debt.

Chevron fully erased the value of its Venezuela operations from its books, amounting to $2.6 billion, after they were effectively frozen by U.S. sanctions, and wrote down another $1.8 billion in assets due to lower commodities prices.

Even stripping out the impairments, Chevron’s adjusted loss was $3 billion, more than twice the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey and the deepest since at least 1989.

“While demand and commodity prices have shown signs of recovery, they are not back to pre-pandemic levels, and financial results may continue to be depressed into the third quarter 2020,” Chevron said in a statement Friday.

Venezuela and low prices aside, Chevron also had a one-off charge of $780 million related to its plan to cut 6,000 jobs, or about 13%, of its workforce.

Despite the red ink, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth saw an opportunity for expansion amid the rout: the $5 billion, all-stock takeover of Noble Energy Inc (NASDAQ: ). announced less than two weeks ago. The deal comes at a minuscule premium and plugs holes in Chevron’s long-term portfolio, analysts noted.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/exxon-chevron-earnings-gutted-by-virusdriven-demand-collapse-2176831,0.144,0.816,0.04,-0.996

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ) on Friday reported a $1.1 billion (837.4 million pounds) second-quarter loss on sharply lower energy demand and prices from the COVID-19 pandemic, and confirmed plans to make ""significant"" reduction to costs.

It was the first back-to-back quarterly loss for the oil giant in at least 36 years, but was small in comparison to rivals that have written down oil and gas properties by billions of dollars apiece on expectations that prices will remain low. The top U.S. oil producer took no impairments during the quarter, and got a 44 cent a share boost to earnings by reversing inventory valuations.

Chevron Corp (N: ), Total (PA: ), Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), and Eni (MI: ) each wrote down billions of dollars in assets, while BP (L: ) signaled an up to $17.5 billion hit.

The COVID-19 pandemic slashed oil prices, sending Exxon's oil and gas production business to a loss. Its refining businesses was hit by a fall in demand, but an improvement in inventory valuations pushed overall refining profits into the black by nearly $1 billion.

The U.S. oil major reported a loss of $1.08 billion, or 26 cents per share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with a profit of $3.13 billion, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier.

An adjusted loss of 70 cents per share missed Wall Street's estimate of 61 cents, according to Refinitiv.

Oil and gas output fell 7% from a year earlier to 3.6 million barrels per day in the quarter as it curtailed output due to the oil price crash and threat that global oil storage would fill in May.

The pandemic ""significantly impacted our second quarter financial results with lower prices, margins, and sales volumes,"" said Chief Executive Darren Woods.

Prior to the pandemic, Exxon pursued an ambitious spending plan to boost oil output and turnaround sagging profits on a bet that a growing global middle class would demand more of its products.

But Woods's plan to raise production and money by selling some assets has stumbled and the company has slashed its capital spending plans for this year by 30%. Exxon is preparing deeper spending and job cuts, according to people familiar with the matter, as it fights to preserve a 8% shareholder dividend.

It said on Friday it had identified more potential cost cuts and was doing an ""evaluation across the businesses on a country-by-country basis.""

Its production business reported a nearly $1.7 billion loss as the company curtailed output and suffered from lower oil prices, compared with a $3.3 billion gain last year.

Profits in chemicals were $467 million, up from $188 million last year, and ""resilient"" in a tough environment, said analyst Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited.

But Exxon's cash flow of $1.5 billion ""pales in comparison to European counterparts this quarter, all of which are smaller businesses,"" Borkhataria said.

Shares were down 2.3% to $41.98 in premarket trading. The stock is down by half since Woods took over in 2017.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/exxon-posts-second-straight-quarterly-loss-on-demand-price-plunge-2176902,0.104,0.801,0.095,-0.1027

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shell Midstream Partners (N: ) said on Friday it would cut staffing and trim projects to save $10 million this year and up to $40 million next year as volumes on some pipelines fall.

The Houston-based affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) transported 20% fewer barrels on its Zydeco oil pipeline while volumes on its Eastern Corridor pipeline fell nearly 23% during the second quarter, officials said on an earnings call on Friday.

Lower volumes on the two were due to ""the continuing effects of COVID-19, along with a few shallow-water producer curtailments,"" Shawn Carsten, its finance chief, said.

Measures to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus have slashed as much as 30% off global fuel demand, leading refiners to cut crude runs and producers to shut wells.

Despite the diminished pipeline volumes, the company's second-quarter revenue was relatively flat at $120 million compared with $121 million for the prior three months.

Volume losses were partially offset by the contributions from deals involving the Mattox crude pipeline and other storage and pipeline acquisitions this year, officials said.

The company said expense cuts could lead to roughly $10 million in lower costs this year and between $30 million and $40 million in 2021.

It is still moving ahead with plans to expand its Mars crude pipeline and expects it to come online in 2021.

Shell does not want to comment on the specifics of expected added capacity or what it would spend on the project on the 163-mile (262-km) Mars pipeline system. It currently transports up to 600,000 barrels per day from the Mississippi Canyon-area production platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to storage caverns in Clovelly, Louisiana.

Second-quarter volumes on the Mars pipeline declined 7% to 501,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with 537,000 the prior quarter, the company said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/shell-midstream-cuts-costs-as-demand-destruction-hits-us-pipeline-flows-2177200,0.084,0.888,0.028,-0.947

(Reuters) - MotoGP races in Argentina, Thailand and Malaysia this year have been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic but one more race will be added to the calendar and will be held in Europe in November, MotoGP announced on Friday.

A number of races have been axed this season due to the new coronavirus outbreak, including the Qatar, Dutch, German, Finnish, British, Australian, Japanese, Italian and American rounds.

""The FIM, IRTA and Dorna Sports regret to announce the cancellation of the Gran Premio Motul de la Republica Argentina, OR Thailand Grand Prix and Shell (LON: ) Malaysia Motorcycle Grand Prix in 2020,"" MotoGP said in a joint statement with the governing FIM and teams' association IRTA.

""After the Gran Premio Motul de la Comunitat Valenciana, another race weekend will take place from the 20th to the 22nd of November at a venue in Europe, becoming the 2020 season finale.""

The host venue in Europe has not yet been decided and will be confirmed on Aug. 10.

The season restarted earlier this month with back-to-back races at the Jerez circuit in Spain. The country will host seven races as part of the revised European calendar while four more circuits are set to host double-headers.

Promoter Dorna Sports added that the Thai Grand Prix will remain on the MotoGP calendar until at least 2026 and that they had started work on discussing possible dates for races in Argentina and Malaysia next year.

(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). briefly became the world’s most valuable company with its market value overtaking Saudi Aramco (SE: ) in the wake of better-than-expected earnings.

Apple rose as much as 7.1% on Friday, touching a record market capitalization of $1.765 trillion. It’s the first time the company’s valuation has surpassed that of Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, which made its market debut in Riyadh in December. Before that, Apple had vied with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). for the title of the U.S.’s largest public company.

The horse race with Aramco comes after a tumultuous period for the Saudi company. Its initial public offering fell short of Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman’s expectations. The kingdom’s de facto ruler initially wanted a valuation of $2 trillion and to raise $100 billion. But after foreign investors balked at the pricing, the government settled on a smaller domestic offering and raised about $30 billion, still the largest IPO ever.

Then came this year’s plunge in crude prices as energy demand crashed with the spread of the virus. Aramco’s second-quarter revenue probably dropped to about $37 billion from $75 billion a year earlier, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s less than the $59.7 billion in sales that Apple reported for the most recent period.

Aramco’s stock is down 6.4% since the end of December, though that’s far less than the fall of other oil majors. Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). has declined 38% and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc has dropped 47%.

Apple, meanwhile, has benefited as the pandemic has strengthened the market positions of the world’s biggest technology companies, which boast strong balance sheets and fast-growing businesses thanks to an acceleration in the shift to digital services. The iPhone maker has added more than $1 trillion in market value so far this year.

As the RDSB share price falters on results, are Shell shares a good buy?

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HBR +0.79% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE:RDSB) released its second-quarter results this week, and it suffered losses in several areas. The RDSB share price has been falling in recent weeks, and these latest results have not helped. While it is still up from its March low of around £9 a share, the RDSB share price has dropped more than half its value since January.

These second-quarter results may make depressing reading, but surprisingly they are slightly better than analysts were expecting. This offers a beacon of hope in a murky sea of financial bad news.

Times are hard for oil companies, and the majors are not exempt from the downturn. The price of oil persists in the $40 range with little sign of rapid recovery until the pandemic is brought under control. As Covid-19 still rages on, the light at the end of the tunnel seems a distant flicker. With expectations of a subdued oil price for some time to come, Shell adjusted the value of its assets, which resulted in a $16.8bn pre-tax impairment charge for the quarter.

All is not lost One advantage oil giants like Shell have over smaller independent oil companies like Premier Oil (LON: ), is that they have an in-house trading division. This is like their own day-trading department that allows them to make big profits in oil price volatility. This has paid off in recent months and helped generate $2.4bn in underlying profit for its oil products division. An impressive sum, 89% higher than the equivalent period in 2019. Its underlying chemicals profits also rose through the period, up 56% to $206m.

CEO Ben van Beurden said: “Our decisive cash preservation measures will underpin the strengthening of our balance sheet. Our high-quality integrated portfolio, disciplined execution and forward-looking strategy enable sustained competitive free cash flow generation.”

Despite finding itself amid a global crisis, Shell’s management’s focus is on working to ensure it emerges stronger and fitter. It took decisive action as the coronavirus impact took hold, rebasing its dividend for the first time in over 70 years and postponing the next tranche of its share buyback programme. It also sped up digitalisation initiatives that should reap benefits and cash savings in the future. All of this has prevented the RDSB share price from crashing outright.

A wobble in the RDSB share price Uncertainty regarding oil demand for the next couple of years, along with geopolitical struggles and global financial woes, are all factors contributing to the wobbling RDSB share price. It is no surprise there is nervousness in the financial markets and many companies are seeing their share prices suffer.

In the very long term, I think Shell, along with its peer BP (LON: ), will reinstate themselves as big players in energy, both in fossil fuel and renewables. This is not likely to be a quick recovery, but I think success will eventually prevail. Although RDSB cut its dividend in the spring, it looks safe at this level and still offers a yield of around 4%. In the current economic circumstances, this is not a bad return for an income investor’s portfolio. Overall, I think RDSB shares remain a good buy at current prices.

(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). is ripping up its debt-fueled, $30 billion-a-year plan to rebuild an aging worldwide portfolio after cash flow evaporated and threatened the company’s vaunted dividend.

The shift by the Western world’s premier oil explorer represents an about-face after more than two years of doing pretty much the opposite of the its biggest rivals, who have been been shrinking and looking to a future beyond fossil fuels. As recently as March, the Texas giant had pinned its future to huge capital spending on oil and at a time when rivals were shrinking and looking to a future beyond fossil fuels.

Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods’ plan was to lean on the company’s impeccable balance sheet to drill for gushers and still cover almost $15 billion in annual dividends. If cash flow fell short, Exxon’s stellar credit rating would allow it to borrow its way through lean times, or so the thinking went.

But the black swan event of a global pandemic that smashed energy demand amid a stubborn glut of crude overwhelmed Woods’ ambitions. Cash flow from operations fell to zero in the second quarter, Exxon disclosed Friday, and one of the CEO’s top lieutenants announced all bets were off.

The company is pursuing “significant potential” budget reductions and some managers may find themselves out of a job as a result, Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said during a conference call with analysts.

Those cuts would be in addition to ongoing efforts to trim its U.S. workforce by as much as 10% and a $10 billion scale-back in capital outlays announced in April.

Five Projects

More striking was Chapman’s announcement that work on Exxon’s five marquee developments -- deepwater oil in Guyana and Brazil, Permian Basin shale, gas exports from Mozambique and Papua New Guinea -- will all be curtailed or delayed.

Still, he rejected any suggestion that Exxon was undertaking a strategic shift. Rather, Exxon is prioritizing dividend coverage and protecting its balance sheet, said Chapman, one of three top executives who serve with Woods on the management committee that oversees day-to-day operations.

“I don’t think it’s a fundamental change,” Chapman said. “I think it’s a response to the short-term environment.”

Exxon is keenly sensitive to the fate of its dividend because 70% of the company’s shareholders are retail investors, he noted. Keeping that payout to shareholders is “something we take really, really seriously.”

Spending Plans

The commitment comes at a significant cost. Exxon already reduced its capital spending plan by about a third to around $23 billion three months ago as the pandemic panicked the world’s major economies. Next year’s outlays probably will shrink to $19 billion, Chapman indicated.

Though a major reversal for management, the scaled-down outlook may appease investors. The counter-cyclical growth strategy was never embraced by the market, with the stock plunging to a 15-year low even before the virus hit. Exxon had dropped out of the top 10 biggest companies in the S&P 500 Index for the first time in 2019 and lost its premium valuation over peers a year earlier.

Still, without so much money being spent on new projects, questions remain over how Exxon can mitigate its long-term production declines and how resilient its assets will be in an energy transition toward low-carbon fuels.

Rivals Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and BP (NYSE: ) Plc wrote down billions of dollars of assets in the past quarter because of the depressed price outlook. Exxon, famously resilient to writedowns, took no such charges.

November Meeting

The company is currently undergoing its annual, “very rigorous” process of reviewing the value of its assets and should present the results to the board by November, Chapman said. While Exxon doesn’t publish price forecasts, unlike European peers, Chapman said they’re “consistent with the range of third-party estimates.”

Exxon dropped 0.9% to $41.47 at 1:19 p.m. in New York, giving it a market value of $175 billion. That’s nearly $100 billion less than electric car manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc.

FTSE 100 falls to two month low! Here’s how I’d invest £1,000 in an ISA today

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HSBA -1.33% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LLOY -0.41% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BWY +1.35% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HIK +1.33% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BDEV -0.08% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio PSN +1.71% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio STAN -0.97% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio RTO -1.17% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio FTMC -0.21% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

July’s been a poor month for the FTSE 100. The index fell below 6,000 for the first time since 22 May at its close on Thursday. It also closed at the lowest since mid-May or in two-and-a-half months. There’s more. After two straight months of gains, the index average in July fell by 1%.

Poor performances drag down FTSE 100 There’s a bunch of reasons for the latest tumble, the first of which is a poor set of financial results by FTSE 100 heavyweights like Lloyds (LON: ) Bank and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), which both posted a sharp contraction in income. In LLOY’s case, there’s actually a pre-tax loss. Moreover, banks like HSBC and Standard Chartered (LON: ) find themselves caught in the US-China trade tensions as the second cold war gets more real by the day. News from the global economy wasn’t exactly encouraging either. The US economy shrank the most on record and the German economy contracted too, pulling world indexes down as well.

Investing in the ‘new normal’ I wish I could say otherwise, but I doubt if this situation will be resolved soon. In other words, I think investors are looking at a rapidly evolving ‘new normal’ in which to navigate their stock market decisions. What makes this the ‘new normal’? One, the pandemic has been controlled to an extent but, until such time as there’s a vaccine or cure for Covid-19, fluctuations in the markets can be expected. Two, the economic aftermath of the pandemic is yet to play out. I think that economic weakness will continue well into 2021, which will also create uncertainty in the . Third, continued tensions between the US and China on the one hand and Brexit uncertainty on the other will also keep the index in a range.

Where I would invest £1,000 However, I don’t think what’s true for the broader index is necessarily so for all its constituents. Many FTSE 100 companies continue to be high performers even during this time. Consider pharmaceutical companies like AstraZeneca and Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LON: ), which were gainers at Thursday’s close. It’s not a coincidence. They are financially healthy companies with good prospects. The pest control and hygiene services provider Rentokil Initial (LON: ) was another gainer, for the same reasons.

One reason investors could be hesitant to buy these stocks is that their prices have already run up quite a bit already. Going by the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, AZN is quite expensive. RTO too, isn’t among the most price-competitive stocks. However, others like HIK are relatively cheap, with a P/E of 11 times.

I think it’s also a good time to dip a toe back in cyclicals. Correction in some sectors has been quite dramatic, and because of this, I think they can make gains even in an otherwise indifferent environment. I like companies such as Persimmon (LON: ) and Barratt Developments (LON: ), which have suffered along with the rest of the property segment. I think companies like Marshalls and Bellway (LON: ) are also ones to consider for investing £1,000 in an ISA.

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio WTB +0.43% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ULVR -0.47% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SN -0.82% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio OCDO -2.32% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Even though we aren’t technically in a stock market crash right now, the ’s July performance is a good reminder of what it’s like to be in the midst of one. The index fell during the month, after two months of increase. While the fall isn’t massive, at 1%, it is disappointing at a time when there’s much lost ground to be recovered. I mean, the index is still 18% lower than the January average. But there’s an upside to this trend. As a result of it, the best UK shares are available at low prices.

What makes the best UK share By best UK shares, I mean those that meet the following three criteria. One, they should be financially sound. Even if they are under pressure right now, like Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), for instance, their long-term credentials should speak for them. Two, they should have good future prospects, like online marketplaces such as Ocado (LON: ) and Rightmove. Three, their share price movements should inspire confidence. For instance, the long-term price chart of the consumer goods’ company Unilever (LON: ) or the healthcare provider Smith & Nephew (LON: ) broadly trends upwards. These stocks have been rewarding over time even though they have seen short-term fluctuations.

Ideally, the best UK shares should also have two more attributes. One, it’s a notable plus if they are dividend paying in these times when passive incomes have taken a huge hit. And two, they should be reasonably priced. And by price, I’m talking about the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which allows comparison with other FTSE 100 stocks.

Shares that meet the cut I know that sounds like a tall order. But the astute investor knows that in bad times, even the best UK shares can be found at low valuations. Buying them for a Stocks and Shares ISA at such times is the kind of move that can make you a millionaire over time. Now I know it’s not easy to time the markets. It’s just easier to buy the best UK shares, which meet the required criteria as mentioned above, and wait for them to reap investing rewards. Even if that doesn’t exactly make us millionaires at speed, it can significantly add to our wealth creation efforts.

However, if we do find ourselves catching the best UK shares at low prices, we shouldn’t hesitate to buy at such times either. The FTSE 100 index’s softening in July has created fresh opportunities to buy some of them. I’m looking closely at those that suffered most during the lockdown, like travel and hospitality companies. One example is the owner of the Premier Inn, Whitbread (LON: ). It has a good track record and there’s no reason to doubt its long-term prospects either. While cyclicality is evident in its share prices, it’s still on the rising curve. And it’s still reasonably priced. Another example is a high performing company is Unilever, which incidentally, also pays dividends. There are others too, which give the investor the opportunity to make big gains starting in August.

LONDON (Reuters) - The trading units of European oil and gas majors have shielded their second-quarter results from the full force of the corona-induced collapse in demand for fuel, but big writedowns showed the scale of the challenge ahead, results showed on Thursday.

France's Total (PA: ) and Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) scraped out small profits against expectations of losses with the help of the trading units which can exploit market gyrations even when prices fall.

""These results are driven in particular by the outperformance of trading activities, once again demonstrating the relevance of Total's integrated model,"" Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement.

Shell Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said the company had ""stellar"" trading results due to ""solid, good market conditions,"" in particular high volatility in oil prices which allows nimble traders to take advantage of small changes in order to buy, store or sell fuels.

Eni's (MI: ) refining and marketing unit's second-quarter profit shot up by 76% to $139 million compared with a year ago, although the company overall still swung to a loss, it said on Thursday.

But trading earnings have not protected the companies from the gloomier longer term prospects for demand. The pandemic has prompted energy firms to slash long-term crude price outlooks, cutting the value of their assets.

France's Total (PA: ) wrote down $8 billion in the quarter, while Shell cut the value of its assets by $16.8 billion. Eni wrote down 3.5 billion euros ($4.1 billion) and BP (LON: ), due to report second-quarter results on Aug. 4, has guided for a $17.5 billion hit.

Shell responded to the pandemic by cutting its dividend for the first time since World War Two and lowering planned spending this year by $5 billion to a maximum of $20 billion.

Eni cut its dividend and introduced a new dividend policy based on the oil price. Equinor also cut its dividend and suspended a share buyback.

BP and Total have not cut their dividends.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ) is preparing deep spending and job cuts, according to people familiar with the matter, as it fights to preserve a 8% shareholder dividend with a multi-billion-dollar quarterly loss looming.

It was unclear how extensive the cuts will be. The largest U.S. oil company slashed this year's budget by 30% in April, but Chief Executive Darren Woods's turnaround through rebounding demand and increased asset sales have not panned out and losses are climbing.

On Friday, Exxon is expected to report a $2.63 billion (2.02 billion pounds) second-quarter loss, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, on sharply lower prices and weaker production, the first back-to-back quarterly losses in at least 36 years. Shares are down 35% so far this year as the coronavirus pandemic has crushed fuel demand.

The latest cost cuts are needed to preserve the company's nearly $15 billion annual payout to shareholders in the face of rising losses, the people said. Exxon will not generate enough cash from production operations to cover this year's dividend, analysts have said. It borrowed $18 billion earlier this year to bolster cash.

(For a graphic on Exxon's quarterly results, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/3aTTnrp)

Woods so far this year held to the view that oil, and petrochemicals demand would rebound following an historic crash that saw global consumption fall by roughly one-third and U.S. prices plunge into negative territory in April.

Rivals BP Plc (L: ), Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Total (PA: ) have slashed up to $45 billion in the combined value of their oil and gas properties. Meanwhile, Exxon's 2019 plan to raise $15 billion by 2021 through asset sales has gotten off to a slow start, fizzling this year due to lackluster demand from potential buyers.

With energy prices expected to remain lackluster for years, Woods has turned to spending and staff cuts, and a business restructuring to salvage the payout. Rival Chevron Corp (N: ) has stood out as producing enough cash from operations to cover its dividend.

Even if it does retain its full dividend this year, a cut is ""a real possibility in 2021,"" given the outlook for oil, said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones. ""There is only so much Exxon can continue to lean on its balance sheet before they start to jeopardize"" the payout, Rowland said.

The dividend, which yields about 8% at Wednesday's closing price of $44.03 a share, is sacrosanct at Exxon, which until this year raised the payout annually for 37 years. Its market value, however, has dropped by half since Woods took over in January 2017.

Exxon has no plans for layoffs due to the pandemic and no percentage targets to reduce its workforce through this year's employee reviews, said spokesman Casey Norton.

""We are continually monitoring market conditions and our deep portfolio has flexibility to adjust our plans,"" Norton said.

Still, Exxon late last year changed its employee review system, internally referred to as forced ranking. The revision could increase the number of workers who land in the bottom category - to between 8% and 10% up from 3% last year. Those in the bottom category can either strive to meet their manager's performance goals or leave with 90 days' pay, person familiar with the matter said.

The ranking applies only to its U.S. professional staff. It has 74,900 employees worldwide, and about 40% are in the United States.

In April, Exxon slashed this year's capital spending budget to $23 billion, down $10 billion from the start of the year and to the lowest in four years. At the time, Woods said he could further revise spending this year or next.

Prior to the pandemic, Woods had vowed investments in new fields, new and expanded chemical and refining operations would revive Exxon's earnings and production.

In early 2019, he predicted investments in production and refining could produce a $4 billion increase in earnings this year over last and reach up to $21.5 billion by 2025 at $40 a barrel oil, slightly below the current price.

Woods also set a target to bring in $15 billion from asset sales between 2019 through 2021. Last year, it the sales brought in nearly $3.7 billion but proceeds this year are only $86 million.

""It has fallen a bit behind schedule but there have been reports there are several packages out,"" said Cowen analyst Jason Gabelman, who expects Exxon to reiterate the asset sale target on Friday.

Wall Street will watch for new capital and operating expense cuts ""and other available levers to defend the dividend,"" Gabelman said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/exclusive-exxon-prepares-spending-job-cuts-in-last-ditch-move-to-save-dividend-2175812,0.096,0.848,0.057,-0.9829

(Bloomberg) -- Glencore (LON: ) said trading profit will be at the top end of its target this year as the commodities giant joins big oil companies enjoying a bonanza from volatile price swings.

The company made nearly $1 billion in earnings before interest and taxes in oil trading in the first six months of 2020, similar to what the company made in the whole of 2019, people familiar with the matter said last week.

Oil trading profits have bailed out the energy sector so far this year. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc said Thursday that the last quarter was the best on record for its trading business, while French rival Total SE said it was able to exploit extreme price volatility during April’s record supply glut.

“Our marketing business has also risen to the challenge, delivering robust counter-cyclical earnings,” Glencore Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg said in a statement Friday. “A very strong first-half performance allows us to now raise our full year 2020 EBIT expectations to the top end of our $2.2-$3.2 billion guidance range.”

The trading profit will be a relief for Glencore. Once again, the miner and trader has missed out on an iron rally that has provided bumper earnings for its biggest rivals, such as Rio Tinto (NYSE: ) Plc and Anglo American (LON: ) Plc. Glencore’s mining profits are driven by coal and , but it has no exposure to the steelmaking ingredient.

While copper prices have been resilient through the pandemic, thermal coal has crashed, falling to the lowest levels since the commodity crisis five years ago.

Glencore responded today by saying it would mine less of the fuel, cutting its target for the year to about 114 million tons, from a previous forecast of 132 million tons. The cuts will come from its Colombian mines, which are struggling because of weak demand for the product in Europe. The company said it wants to keep its Prodeco mine in the country closed for now.

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Rising OPEC and U.S. oil supply, coupled with stalled economic and crude demand recovery, have pushed the futures market structure back to indicating a surplus, last observed during oil's collapse in April and May amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The development is a headache for OPEC, which had been hoping demand would recover quicker after a round of record global output cuts. The group will either have to consider further production cuts or tolerate lower oil prices for longer.

The surplus market structure, when prompt prices are weaker than future prices, is also a boon for traders, as they can store crude in the hope to resell it later at a profit. Royal Dutch/Shell, Total, Eni and Norway's Equinor have all reported bumper trading profits over the past week.

Front-month September futures in the past week have been trading at a discount of $2 per barrel to March 2021, the steepest discount since May, when lockdown measures against the virus outbreak cut global oil demand by a third.

The structure is known as contango and usually indicates an immediate oil surplus and hopes for a demand recovery in future months. The opposite structure is known as backwardation.

""OPEC's experiment to increase production from August could backfire as we are still nowhere near out of the woods yet in terms of oil demand,"" said Bjornar Tonhaugen, Rystad Energy's Head of Oil Market Research.

""The market will flip back into a mini-supply glut and a swing into deficit will not happen again until December 2020.""

OPEC did not respond to a request for comment.

Howie Lee, economist at Singapore's OCBC bank, said the market was unconvinced demand was recovering and instead was choosing to buy further down the curve at a rising premium.

Record coronavirus infection and death rates in the United States and some other parts of the world are stoking fears that a new virus wave could further hit demand.

Many exchange traded funds were also spreading their long positions more equally across the curve after some asset managers were badly burnt by April's negative expiry of U.S. front-month WTI crude futures, Lee said.

Brent spreads have historically been a good proxy for the global production-consumption balance as well as inventories (https://tmsnrt.rs/2BMrcPi).

PHYSICAL CRUDE WEAKNESS

The physical oil market is also weakening.

Cash Dubai and DME Oman prices on Tuesday flipped into discounts to Dubai swaps for the first time since end-May due to weak demand including from China. Dubai August/September inter-month spreads also flipped from backwardation into contango in late July.

Abu Dhabi, Iraqi and Qatari grades all fell to spot discounts to their official selling prices and some cargoes are still hanging unsold, according to three Asian traders.

Demand from top buyer China softened due to weak margins, prolonged port congestion, severe flood and limited crude import quotas, several China-focused traders have said.

In Europe, rising U.S. exports are also depressing spot physical prices.

""U.S. producers are bringing back wells they had previously shut... Given the disappointing demand, it raises the possibility that the market returns to building inventories,"" said Warren Patterson from ING.

exports have risen to 3.2 million barrels per day last week, the highest since mid-May. Much of the U.S. production curtailments in the spring came from shale wells that were choked back but not shut-in completely.

WTI at Midland, Texas, the heart of the Permian basin, this week slid to trade at a discount to benchmark futures as curtailed volumes returned to the market, traders said.

""The market is most certainly feeling the effects of the China buying ending after the massive buying seen over the last few months,"" said Scott Shelton from United ICAP (LON: ).",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/headache-for-opec-as-oil-market-structure-signals-return-of-glut-2175590,0.088,0.868,0.044,-0.954

Futures in New York rose as much as 1.6%, following a 3.3% drop on Thursday. The U.S. economy suffered its sharpest downturn since at least the 1940s in the second quarter, pointing to how coronavirus has devastated businesses across the country. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits increased for a second straight week, while Germany’s economy shrank the most in at least half a century in the second quarter.

is down about 2% over the week, but remains on track to eke out a modest gain for July. The market’s rally from April’s price collapse into negative territory has stalled around $40 a barrel amid signs of a resurgence of the virus across parts of the U.S. and now Europe. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said oil demand may not see a full recovery until next year.

On the supply side, the OPEC+ alliance is days away from unleashing crude back onto the market following historic output cuts, and in the U.S., ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ) is the latest explorer to announce it’s bringing back oil production after prices recovered from historic lows. Shale producers Continental Resources (NYSE: ) Inc., Parsley Energy (NYSE: ) Inc. and EOG Resources Inc (NYSE: ). have said they would restore some curtailed output in July.

For the first time since the oil price recovery started three months ago, Saudi Arabia and other top Middle East producers are coming under heavy pressure to cut the price of their barrels, a sign of how the rally has begun to stall.

The secretive oil-trading businesses of Shell and Total SE saved both European majors from posting losses in the second quarter, bringing a torrent of cash that countered the impact of the coronavirus crisis.

How low will Shell’s share price go?

SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Investors in Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) have had a bad year. The Shell share price has now fallen by more than 50% in 2020, thanks to a spectacular oil market crash.

Thursday’s half-year results didn’t do much to improve investors’ mood. Adjusted earnings for the period fell by 60% to $3.5bn and Shell reported a statutory loss of more than $18bn.

Things look grim, but the half-year numbers were actually better than expected. I don’t think shareholders need to panic. In fact, I think Shell’s share price could offer decent value at current levels.

Profits are better than expected Shell’s profits for the first half of this year are dominated by the impact of a $21bn impairment charge. What this means is that the company has decided future oil and gas prices are going to be lower than previously expected. As a result, management have cut the value of some of the oil and gas assets on its balance sheet. This is why Shell reported an $18bn loss for the first half of the year.

This is a disappointment, but it’s worth remembering this is an accounting charge, not a cash loss. I think that a better way to look at Shell’s performance in this difficult period is by focusing on underlying profits and free cash flow.

Shell scores quite well here, in my view. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $638m, while first-half earnings clocked in at $3,498m. These numbers were ahead of analysts’ forecasts.

The secret here is that Shell and the other big oil and gas firms all have large in-house trading divisions. These can generate big profits during periods when the oil price swings wildly. That’s what seems to have happened in Q2.

Cash flow should support Shell’s share price If you’re investing for dividends, then one of the first places you should look is at a company’s cash flow statement. Ultimately, if a company isn’t generating enough surplus cash to pay its dividend, then the dividend might need to be cut.

Shell stunned the market in April by cutting its dividend for the first time since World War II. But this week’s accounts tell me that the group’s cash generation is still pretty solid.

Free cash flow during the first half of the year was $10,050m, excluding one-off payments for asset sales. Impressively, that figure is actually slightly higher than during the first half of 2019, when so-called organic free cash flow was $9,559m.

Annualising this number suggests to me that Shell could generate around $20bn of free cash flow this year.That would value the stock at just six times free cash flow – not expensive at all.

Why I’m holding onto my Shell shares I don’t think anyone is pretending that Shell is a growth business. But it does have many large oil and gas fields with fairly low operating costs. I expect these to remain big generators of cash.

Rather than recyling all of this cash into new fossil fuel assets, I expect Shell to spend increasing amounts on renewable investments and shareholder dividends.

With the stock trading at 1,100p, Shell’s dividend yield stands at around 4.5%. It’s lower than we’ve become used to from Shell, but I think this could be a good entry point for a dividend investor.

It’s fair to say that the performance of the (INDEXFTSE: UKX) over the last two decades has been disappointing.

20 years ago, on 31 July 2000, the FTSE 100 closed at 6,365 points. Yesterday, the index closed at 5,990 points meaning that it has literally gone backward in two decades.

Of course, when you factor in dividends – which tend to make up a significant proportion of long-term total stock market returns – overall returns over 20 years will have been positive.

Yet realistically, the long-term returns from the FTSE 100 have not been great. Especially when you consider that the main US stock market index, the , has delivered a return of about 125% plus dividends over the last 20 years.

This underperformance begs the question: what’s the best move now? Is it worth sticking with the FTSE 100 index? Or is there a better approach to investing?

Why has the FTSE 100 underperformed? To answer that question, we should first look at why the FTSE 100 has struggled over the last 20 years.

The main reason the Footsie has delivered underwhelming returns is that many of the companies with the largest weightings in the index have struggled to generate growth in recent years.

For example, there are the oil majors Shell (LON: ) and BP (LON: ). They are struggling for growth due to low oil prices and the increasing focus on sustainability.

Then, you have banks such as HSBC, Barclays (LON: ), and Lloyds. These companies are struggling due to low interest rates, the economic environment, and competition from FinTech.

You also have tobacco companies such as British American Tobacco (LON: ) that are facing huge challenges, and slow-moving telecommunications giants such as Vodafone (LON: ) and BT.

Compounding this growth issue is the fact that the FTSE 100 has very little exposure to the technology sector. Whereas the S&P 500 has a number of tech powerhouses such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), the FTSE 100 only has a handful of smaller tech companies such as Sage and Rightmove.

When you break down the FTSE 100 index like this, it’s easy to see why it has underperformed.

These 3 moves should improve your returns Given the structure of the FTSE 100, I think there’s a real case for being selective about your investment choices, going forward.

Instead of just investing in a FTSE 100 tracker fund, and gaining exposure to the whole index, I’d be a little more ‘active’ and build a portfolio that is focused on the best investment opportunities in order to target higher returns. Specifically, I’d make three key moves.

Firstly, I’d focus on the best stocks within the FTSE 100. I’m talking about the types of stocks that top fund managers such as Terry Smith and Nick Train invest in such as Unilever (LON: ), Diageo (LON: ), and Sage. These kinds of stocks are proven long-term performers.

Secondly, I’d add plenty of exposure to international markets such as the US, Europe, and Asia. Many of the world’s top companies such as Apple and Microsoft are listed overseas. You can gain international exposure easily through funds and ETFs.

Finally, I’d look at investing in some high-quality UK companies that are outside the FTSE 100. Adding some mid-cap and small-cap stocks to your portfolio can really turbo-charge your returns. If you’re looking for ideas in this space, you’ll find plenty at The Motley Fool.

Follow this more active approach, and I think it’s highly likely you’ll outperform the FTSE 100 index over time.

Since hitting its recent post-meltdown peak near 6,485 on 5 June, the has been sliding. Poor corporate forecasts have pushed the index down to 5,964 today. That’s a fall of around 520 points (8%), on top of steeper falls earlier this year.

A FTSE 100 giant stumbles One share dragging down the FTSE 100 today is Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB), whose shares dived after the oil supermajor released its half-year results.

As I write, Shell shares trade at 1,121p, down 60p (5%) on yesterday’s close. Exactly a year ago (30 July 2019), shares in this FTSE 100 colossus closed at 2,641p. In other words, over the past year, Shell shares have crashed by 57.6%. Ouch.

Today, Shell shares stand 26% above their 52-week bottom below 890p set on 19 March, during the Covid-19 market meltdown. This FTSE 100 share was the bargain of a lifetime back in March, but do its shares still offer value today?

Shell makes a profit, so its shares slip In the second quarter of 2020, Shell revealed modest (adjusted) earnings of $638m, crashing almost 82% from Q2 2019’s $3.5bn. But some analysts expected the FTSE 100 firm to make billion-dollar losses, so Shell actually positively surprised in this regard.

Despite enduring perhaps the worst quarter in its 113-year history, Shell will pay a second-quarter dividend. Shell slashed its first-quarter dividend from $0.47 to $0.16 its the first cut since World War II. It has held this cash payout at $0.16 for the second quarter. This dividend, worth 12.28p per share, will be paid on 21 September to those owning shares on 13 August.

Shell is still a strong FTSE 100 business Shell would have made much larger losses, had it not been for outstanding results from its oil-trading operations. Remember when the price of a barrel of oil briefly went negative and traded at -$40 in late April? It looks like Shell traders made hay while retail investors got fried.

Then again, Shell conservatively wrote down the value of its assets by $16.8bn, pushing the FTSE 100 stalwart to a reported loss of $18.1bn. But the vast majority of this loss relates to non-cash items, so Shell remains financially strong.

This FTSE 100 fortress has beaten a perfect storm In early January, was selling at close to $70 a barrel, before the price collapsed below $20 in April. It has since recovered to hover around $43, down around a third (34%) over the past 12 months.

Oil consumption collapsed during the coronavirus lockdowns and is only slowly recovering. But any improvement in oil demand and pricing should strengthen Shell’s sickly share price.

Shell is a £91.5bn, century-old survivor Although its market value has more than halved to today’s £91.5bn, Shell has weathered tougher times, including repeated oil crises. This FTSE 100 giant always bounces back, which is why I fully expect it to recover and move on.

For me, this is a surprisingly good set of results from Shell. I expected and feared far more red ink in Shell’s figures, perhaps into billions of dollars. But Shell’s strength and diversification has seen it survive yet another catastrophe. Now it needs to thrive again.

Given the lack of visibility of 2020–21 earnings, any price-to-earnings ratio for this FTSE 100 behemoth would be pure guesswork. But even a severely reduced yearly dividend of $0.64 (49p) a share would equate to a forward dividend yield of almost 4.4%.

Hence, I would buy and hold Shell shares today to bank these tidy cash payouts. Then I’d patiently await a return to better times – and future capital gains, too!

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian oil and gas group OMV (VI: ) set itself long-term targets for curbing carbon emissions on Wednesday, joining industry majors who have already responded to calls from politicians and activists to do more to fight global warming.

OMV said it planned to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its operations and indirect emissions, such as those created from electricity purchased, to net zero by 2050 or sooner.

That should be achieved through energy efficiency measures, new technologies such as carbon storage, the use of alternative feedstocks, such as plastic waste, for its products and the use of solar power for its operations in Austria, it said.

""Implementing these sustainable technologies in a way that is economically feasible will require an appropriate regulatory environment,"" said Chief Executive Rainer Seele.

OMV is relatively late setting such goals, compared to peers such as Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) which has the sector's broadest plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.

BP (L: ) aims to bring net emissions from the barrels from its own operations throughout their life cycle to zero by 2050. It also aims for a 50% reduction of the carbon intensity of all products it sells.

OMV said it aimed to reduce the carbon intensity of its operations by at least 30% by 2025, excluding Borealis. This involved reducing carbon emissions at its exploration and production business by at least 60% compared to 2010 levels and at its refining business by at least 20%.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/austrias-omv-to-reduce-operational-emissions-to-net-zero-by-2050-2174353,0.02,0.943,0.036,0.3446

The Fed is expected to reiterate its accommodative stance, with analysts also expecting it to lay the groundwork for more action later this year.

(Bloomberg) -- ENI (MI: ) SpA (NYSE: ) reported a second-quarter loss and reduced its dividend as the coronavirus crisis sent oil prices plunging.

The Italian giant, one of several European energy majors reporting results on Thursday, was hurt by slumping demand for crude and fuels as governments imposed lockdowns to contain the virus. Consumption fell particularly sharply in its home market, the first European economy crippled by the pandemic.

Eni’s adjusted net loss was 714 million euros ($839 million) in the quarter, compared with a profit of 562 million euros a year earlier, the Rome-based company said in a statement. Analysts had estimated a 1.11 billion-euro loss.

Eni now sees its full-year dividend at 55 euro cents a share, compared with an expectation of 89 euro cents back in February. The decision to cut follows similar moves at Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Equinor ASA (NYSE: ).

Eni’s quarterly production slid to 1.71 million barrels of oil equivalent a day from 1.83 million a day a year earlier, according to the statement.

(Bloomberg) --

Investors and analysts are preparing for the busiest day so far this year for European corporate results when firms worth more than $2 trillion report their latest figures on Thursday. This time, many will still be working from kitchen tables, living-room desks and home offices.

Not only are the firms numerous, with more than 60 companies in the Index set to report, they are also large: their combined market value amounts to nearly a quarter of the benchmark. That’s more than three times the market value of April 30, the busiest earnings day of the previous reporting period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nestle SA (SIX: ), AstraZeneca (NYSE: ) Plc and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc are the headliners.

“It’s like a tsunami,” Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK Plc, said by phone. “It’s an easy way for companies to bury news and I’ve only got one set of eyes, especially when there’s also macroeconomic data to look at.”

While the last Thursday in July is traditionally a hectic day for corporate earnings, analyzing the numbers is complicated by the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdown measures that have roiled businesses and supply chains globally. German gross domestic product and Spanish inflation are further data points that market watchers need to keep eye on that morning. Second-quarter results have so far been broadly positive compared to analysts’ low expectations, particularly after the first quarter was marked by several firms pulling forecasts and suspending dividend payments.

Stern & Co. in London have held more than a hundred virtual meetings with companies and industry experts in the last few months to gauge the impact of the pandemic, according to Katerina Kosmopoulou, a London-based partner who’s currently working remotely from Innsbruck, Austria.

Office Pajamas

The hour gained by not having to commute is an extra hour spent working, Kosmopoulou said, given the massive amount of information to plow through. Communication has also been adapted to the remote environment. Rather than the ad hoc face-to-face chats that used to occur at someone’s desk, J. Stern’s investment team now get on a daily call to share information.

“If everyone is in an office, people get distracted by all sorts of meetings that are in the calendar,” Kosmopoulou said. “Whereas if everyone is working remotely, everyone’s committed to that daily call.”

For some, remote communication cannot replace face-to-face. Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Richard Clarke misses talking to his team in person, as well as being able to physically look at the company’s management in the eye. “It’s easier for them to not answer the question when you’re over the phone rather than in person,” he said.

Still, there are some advantages to working from home during earnings season, according to Clarke, who covers hotels, leisure and catering companies based in Europe and the U.S.

“Given the huge spread of times over which earnings are released, working from home makes it a little easier to deal with,” Clarke said by phone. “When some of our companies report at 6 a.m., it’s more pleasant being able to do it in your pajamas having gotten up 10 minutes earlier rather than braving the commute or being flown to Paris for a company meeting.”

(Bloomberg) -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc’s mammoth oil trading business saved the company from what was expected to be its worst quarterly result of its modern era.

Investors had already been warned that the coronavirus pandemic had affected almost all parts of the energy giant’s business -- from forecourts to its upstream division. But that impact was offset by gains from buying and selling crude and fuels, the company said in a statement on Thursday.

Like its peers Total SE and Equinor ASA (NYSE: ), who reported similar gains, Shell’s oil trading business benefits from its extensive infrastructure, giving the company an advantage in periods of extreme price volatility.

Shell’s adjusted net income was $638 million in the second quarter, down 82% from the same period a year earlier but far better than the average analyst estimate of a $664 million loss.

Contango Play

“Results reflected lower realized prices for oil, LNG and gas, lower realized refining margins, oil products sales volumes and higher well write-offs,” the company said. “This was partly offset by very strong crude and oil products trading.”

Shell and its peers exploited so-called contango plays as oil prices hit rock-bottom. The trade consists of filling up onshore storage or oil tankers with cheap crude and simultaneously selling it on the forward market at higher prices. The move helped the trading division of Norway’s Equinor ASA, which is much smaller than Shell’s, to make a record $1 billion gain in the second quarter.

In addition to taking advantage of a contango structure, Shell also made money on its jet-fuel book in particular, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Shell’s gearing, a measure of indebtedness, rose to 32.7%. While investors were forewarned that gearing would rise by as much as 3% on the back of Shell’s multibillion dollar writedown, it further delays its ability to reach its target of 25%.

Investing.com - European stock markets slumped Thursday, weighed down by disappointing corporate news, particularly from the auto sector, despite the Federal Reserve reiterating its support for the U.S. economy.

At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the in Germany traded 1.6% lower, the in France fell 0.4% and the U.K.'s index was down 0.8%.

Economic data last week, in the form of purchasing managers indexes, indicated that the euro area recovery has gathered speed in July. However, the earnings releases reflect the previous quarter, and have tended to show the severity of the hit from the coronavirus pandemic.

French carmaker Renault (PA: ), down 1.6%, posted a record net loss of 7.29 billion euros in the first half of this year, while German rival Volkswagen (DE: ), down 5%, unveiled a first-half operating loss of 800 million euros, forcing the carmaker to slash its dividend.

Additionally, ENI (MI: ) stock fell 3% after the Italian oil giant reported a second-quarter loss and reduced its dividend. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) just about avoided its first quarterly loss in recent history, while French rival Total (PA: ) booked exceptional impairments of $8.1 billion in the second quarter, but maintained its dividend.

Casino Guichard Perrachon (PA: ) slumped 16% after reporting a much wider loss for the first half, Lloyds Bank (LON: ) dropped 7% after reporting a rare pretax loss in the first half of the year.

On the flip side, AstraZeneca (NYSE: ) gained 2.5% after the pharmaceutical giant said that second-quarter net profit surged and that late-stage trials for the vaccine it is developing with University of Oxford researchers are under way, while Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR: ) jumped 7.5% after an encouraging beer sales recovery in June.

Late Wednesday, the U.S. kept its benchmark rate near zero and suggested rates would remain in this range for some time.

""The economy will need high levels of accommodative monetary policy for an extended period,"" Fed chairman Jerome Powell said.

Second quarter GDP figures are due for release later Wednesday in both the and and will reveal the depth of the economic fallout from the pandemic. Expectations are for an annualized decline in U.S. GDP of 34% on the quarter and an absolute decline of 9.0% in Germany.

Oil prices were lower Thursday, amid worries about the U.S. economic recovery, despite a huge 10.6 million-barrel drop in oil supplies last week.

U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $40.83 a barrel, while the international benchmark contract fell 0.8% to $43.72.

(Bloomberg) -- Total SA (PA: ) made a surprise profit after “very good” trading gains offset some of the slump in oil and gas prices due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Mirroring the performance of some of its peers, the French energy giant published a litany of grim figures -- including an $8.1 billion writedown -- for the second quarter, when much of the world was plunged into lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. Yet its traders successfully exploited the extreme volatility in oil and gas prices resulting from the crisis, helping the company avoid the loss that analysts had expected.

Second-quarter adjusted net income was $126 million, Total said in a statement on Thursday. That’s down 96% from a year earlier, but better than the average loss of $443 million expected by analysts.

Total endured an energy-market crisis, “gas prices dropping to historic lows and refining margins collapsing due to weak demand,” Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said in the statement. Yet the company still made a profit thanks to “the outperformance of trading.”

The combination of slumping demand due to Covid-19 lockdowns and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia meant the oil market started the second quarter deep in a price structure called contango. This allowed traders to make easy money by buying crude cheap, storing it, and selling it forward.

The biggest players with access to onshore storage tanks or ships could make the most money. Norway’s Equinor ASA (NYSE: ) gained about $1 billion in the second quarter as its traders exploited the contango.

E&P Loss

Total’s earnings report wasn’t short on bad news. Its exploration and production division posted a $209 million loss, compared with a profit of $2 billion a year earlier. The company’s fuel-retail networks in Europe suffered a 30% drop in demand in the quarter and its refineries ran at just 60% of capacity. Its writedown was related mainly to the value of Canadian oil sands assets.

Energy consumption and prices started to recover in June, but the company emphasized the uncertainty, volatility and potential for continued weakness in global markets. The price of liquefied on long-term contracts is expected to decline in the second half, and significant deliveries of the fuel may be deferred, it said.

Where it really mattered, Total offered some more good news for investors. It maintained its dividend at 66 euro cents a share and reaffirmed that it was sustainable with at $40 a barrel.

Equinor and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc have already slashed their payouts, and BP (NYSE: ) Plc and Eni SpA are expected to follow, meaning Total may be the only European oil major to fully withstand the current storm.

LONDON (Reuters) - Top U.S. and European oil and gas companies are forecast to swing into a second quarter loss after coronavirus lockdowns destroyed fuel demand, hit prices and squeezed margins, analysts said and Refinitiv Eikon data showed.

The expected rare losses for BP (LON: ), Chevron (NYSE: ), Eni, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Total follow a collapse in oil and gas prices and demand to levels not seen in decades, creating a perfect storm for the energy companies that produce, refine, trade and sell fuel.

During previous price slumps, integrated oil producers' results were boosted by refining operations whose margins typically benefit from low oil prices and provide an internal hedge.

But as travel, industry and business were all halted by lockdowns, margins for refined oil products, such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene, dipped into negative territory.

Oil price benchmarks and U.S. are down around a third year-to-date, falling around 66% in the first quarter and jumping 81% and 92% respectively in the second quarter.

Equinor's marketing and midstream unit, which includes trading, was the company's only department to make a pre-tax profit in the second quarter, as it found itself on the right side of a steep contango structure, with prompt oil prices cheaper than later-dated contracts.

BP and Shell have already downgraded their long-term oil price outlooks, flagging non-cash impairments of $13-17.5 billion and $15-22 billion for the second quarter, respectively.

(Bloomberg) -- Equinor ASA (NYSE: ) reported a surprise profit in the second quarter, helped by trading gains and a tax change designed to get the Norwegian oil industry through the Covid-19 crisis.

The state-controlled producer is the first big oil company to report results for a quarter that was set to be the most painful yet for the industry since the global pandemic destroyed demand earlier this year. Crude prices fell to the lowest levels in almost 20 years in April before a gradual recovery thanks to production cuts led by OPEC and Russia.

The Stavanger-based company reported an adjusted net profit of $646 million, down from a $1.13 billion profit a year ago but well ahead of the expected loss of $250.1 million in a Bloomberg survey. The marketing division delivered a record high result in the quarter, the company said.

“Our financial results for the second quarter were impacted by very low realised oil and gas prices due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but also by a strong trading performance in volatile markets,” Chief Executive Officer Eldar Saetre said in a statement. “We now see a gradual reopening of society in some parts of the world, while other regions are still heavily impacted by the pandemic.”

Rivals Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, BP Plc and Eni SpA have flagged huge writedowns in their upcoming quarterly reports, but Equinor only impaired the value of assets by a net $374 million, as it maintained its long-term oil-price assumptions.

The company earlier this year slashed spending plans for 2020 and became the first oil major to reduce its dividend in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Equinor will maintain its dividend at 9 cents a share for the second quarter, two thirds lower than the level seen at the beginning of the year.

Equinor’s production was 2.011 million barrels of oil equivalent a day during the quarter, compared with a forecast of 2.053 million, according to the average of three estimates. That’s stable from a year ago.

Equinor in May abandoned its previous forecast for a 7% increase in production this year due to market uncertainty and mandatory output cuts in Norway and elsewhere. It’s maintained it’s long-term growth ambitions.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/equinor-reports-surprise-profit-2170021,0.084,0.821,0.095,0.5878

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Residents in several south Texas communities were urged to evacuate on Friday ahead of a storm expected to bring hurricane winds and heavy rain this weekend.

Tropical storm Hanna strengthened and is expected to make landfall on Saturday about 50 miles (80 km) south of Corpus Christi, Texas, as a Category 1 hurricane with very dangerous winds of at least 74 mph (121 kph).

If the eighth-named storm this year becomes a hurricane it would be only the second this season to make landfall along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, after Cristobal which hit Louisiana in early June.

Hanna could bring a life-threatening storm surge and flash flooding. It is expected to drop up to 15 inches of rain in pockets of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico, the U.S. Weather Service said.

Kleberg County, south of Corpus Christi, warned residents of Loyola Beach, Ricardo and Riviera, Texas, of possible flooding and called for a voluntary evacuation.

The storm is not expected to impact offshore oil and gas production. Energy companies were continuing normal operations and had not evacuated workers or shutdown production from their Gulf of Mexico platforms because of Hanna.

Chevron Corp (NYSE: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) ruled out significant impact on operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, spokespeople said.

""The tropical storm has had no impact on Murphy Oil’s Gulf of Mexico operations given its weakness and location in comparison to our assets,"" added Murphy spokeswoman Megan Larson.

BP (LON: ) said Hanna was west of the company's offshore production south of Mississippi and Louisiana.

Corpus Christi, near where the storm is expected to hit on Saturday, is home to three refineries. The largest, Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL], intends to keep its 167,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Corpus Christi operating as the storm passes to the south, people familiar with the matter said.

The others, Valero Energy Corp (N: ) and Flint Hills Resources, did not reply to inquiries.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/shell-expects-minimal-impact-to-us-gulf-drilling-from-storm-hanna-2170856,0.032,0.943,0.025,-0.5709

Best UK shares: I’d buy these dirt-cheap FTSE 100 dividend stocks for a passive income {{0|now}}

The stock market crash has come and gone, but it has sure taken its toll. Many companies cut or suspended dividends as the markets and the economy crashed. As a result, a so-far steady source of investor income has suffered a big blow. Moreover, growth investment opportunities have shrunk as high-quality FTSE 100 stocks made share price gains and the index recovered. But all’s not lost. I think the discerning investor can still find dirt-cheap, dividend-paying stocks, making them among the best UK shares to buy today.

Why dividend investing is important I think its important to renew focus on diviend stocks now. When the economy’s robust and jobs are plentiful, it’s easier to overlook this secondary income source. But in a recession, like now, it can offer stability. Not only is job security for many at a low, there’s no way of knowing how long it will take for the economy to get back on its feet. The latest growth data was dismal, and while some first signs of recovery are visible, it could take some time to gather speed.

The challenge, however, is that dividends have dwindled. Anticipating tough times ahead or already seeing financial weakness, companies are conserving what’s possible. In some cases, the authorities themselves have encouraged them to pause dividends, for example, financial institutions. As a result, what used to be some of the best UK shares for dividends, are no longer viable options.

Best UK shares to buy now I’m not completely discouraged, however, when it comes to building a passive income. This is because there are still some dirt-cheap FTSE 100 stocks that offer a dividend yield. One of them is the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), which hit on particularly hard times recently. In line with this, it reduced its dividend payouts. But the share price adjusted downward as well. As a result, RDSB still has a dividend yield of 4.2%.

This isn’t the best yield that the FTSE 100 has to offer, but buying the share has its unique advantages. One, its inexpensive with a price-to-earnings (P/E) at 9.9 times, especially when compared to many other dividend paying FTSE 100 stocks. Two, it has a long history of paying dividends, which means that the probability of passive income from RDSB falling to zero is low. Three, I reckon its share price will bounce back as the economy starts recovering. I’m even hopeful that it will increase its dividend payouts as its fortunes improve, making it one of the best UK shares to buy now.

I’d also include the FTSE 100 multi-commodity miner Anglo American (LON: ) among the best UK shares to buy now. Similar to Shell, it has a dividend yield of 4.6% but an even lower P/E ratio of 7 times. Its financials may be impacted by the current slowdown this year. But global consulting firm PwC points out that the world’s top 40 miners are weathering this time well, at least so far. AAL is one of these miners, making it one of the best UK shares to buy now.

Have £10k to spend? 3 dividend growth stocks I think could make you an ISA millionaire

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HSBA -1.33% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio PRU -2.47% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio AV -0.90% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

2020 will go down in history as the year in which dividends were devastated. But that doesn’t mean dividend investing is dead. Far from it. I say we’re looking at a fantastic time to tune your ISA investing to build a great future income stream.

This year, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) did the unimaginable. It slashed its dividend for the first time since the end of World War II. Out goes the steady $1.88 (£1.48) per year that’s been providing yields of more than 6%. And in comes a rebased 64 cents (50p).

The Shell share price is down 45% in 2020, so that still offers a healthy yield of 4.1% to investors buying now. But if you’d bought at the start of the year you’d be looking at only around 2.2%. Do I think the Shell dividend and share price will come back strongly? I do, though perhaps not as strongly as the most bullish people are hoping. But I see it beating the fears of the bears.

The oil price is recovering as the world emerges from lockdown, but we might have to wait a while for better Shell dividends. But even a 20% dividend gain would push the yield to 5% on today’s price. I say buy now while we’re in the grip of pessimism.

Big FTSE 100 yield As a shareholder, I’m tempted to recommend Aviva (LON: ) with its forecast yield of 10%. That’s boosted by the 30% share price crash this year, and could be a short-term opportunity. But the instability that’s seen Aviva cut its dividend three times in recent years turns me to Legal & General (LSE: LGEN) instead.

From Legal & General we’re expecting a lower yield of 8% this year, but that’s still impressive. Based on the start-of-year share price, the forecast dividend would have yielded 5.8%. So that shows again the benefit of buying dividend shares when they’re cheap, and locking in years of higher yields.

Every £1,000 invested at a return of 5.8% would turn into nearly £3,100 in 10 years (with dividends reinvested). But if you get in when the yield is up at 8%, that grand would end up worth nearly £4,700. Of course, an 8% dividend might not be maintained, and the year could end up tough for Legal & General. But you’d still pocket a lot more dividend cash buying when the shares are down.

No dividend at all How about going for stocks with no dividend at all right now, but with future potential? Like the banks, which were forced to suspend their dividends by the Prudential (LON: ) Regulation Authority.

I’m thinking of HSBC Holdings (LSE: LON: ) today. I think it’s probably right for UK-centric banks to have withheld their dividends. But I don’t see a lot of sense in HSBC having to suspend its payments when its business is almost totally unrelated to the UK economy.

HSBC shares are down around 35% year-to-date. Had the bank been allowed to maintain its payouts at previous levels, shareholders would be looking forward to a 2020 yield of more than 10% on the current share price.

Should HSBC get back to that level when it’s allowed to, that’s what you could lock in today. But even if HSBC’s dividends take a little while to recover fully, I still think it’s a great time to bag some good long-term yields by buying now.

Premier Oil shares: Is it time to buy or sell?

BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HBR +0.79% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LCO -0.11% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

With now priced at over $40, it’s evident that oil has made a decent recovery. This resulted in the Premier Oil (LSE: LON: ) share price rising over 300%, to 54p. It is currently around 42p. While there has been a slight recovery in the oil sector, problems still abound. As such, is the Premier Oil share price a definite buy or is it destined for a decline?

Balance sheet weakness Premier Oil has one of the weakest balance sheets in the oil sector, and I believe this could weigh heavily on its share price. Currently, the firm has $1.97bn of debt, compared to just over $200m of cash, and $1.1bn in shareholder’s equity. This is an excessive amount of debt in normal times, but in the current economic climate it’s a significant worry. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and BP (LON: ) have recently had to write down the value of their assets. Similar action could be a major problem for Premier Oil, especially because its debt-to-equity ratio already stands at around 180%.

What does the future hold in store? The oil major has recently announced the acquisition of BP’s Andrew Area and its Shearwater assets in a deal worth up to $565m. This was slightly lower than the original price, and only $210m will have to paid up front. It is also stated that the new assets will be “immediately cash generative” and will therefore help the firm reduce its debts.

While this sounds good in principle, I do have some concerns about the deal. For example, it seems an odd time to be making expensive acquisitions, especially in the firm’s indebted position. As a result, many analysts believe that it will have to raise funds from shareholders in order to complete the deal. Equity funding has the result of diluting existing shareholders, and the Premier Oil share price should fall as a result.

Is the Premier Oil share price too cheap to ignore? Premier Oil shares are down around 60% this year, with key metrics proving it’s a significantly undervalued stock. For example, it has a current price-to-earnings ratio of 2.7 and a price-to-book ratio of just 0.4.

But I’d take both of these values with a pinch of salt. Firstly, earnings should drastically decrease over the next few years, and this means that the current price-to-earnings ratio is not an accurate representation. The price-to-book ratio also doesn’t take into account the fact that many of the assets on the balance sheet are also overvalued.

In this respect, I believe that Premier Oil shares are too risky. While there is significant potential upside, bankruptcy is also a genuine worry. This would leave shareholders with nothing. If I were to bet on an oil recovery, I’d buy Royal Dutch Shell shares instead.

These 10 FTSE 100 shares have crashed up to 66%. I’d buy two ‘fallen angels’ today!

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LLOY -0.41% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio RR +0.13% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ITV -1.23% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio CPG +0.72% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ICAG -0.55% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

It’s not been a great year so far for UK investors. The is down over 1,450 points in six months. That’s a loss of 19.2% since late January, before Covid-19 became a global crisis.

The FTSE 100’s fastest fall The damage came in February and March, with the FTSE 100 crashing below 5,000 on 23 March. At 35%, the fall from 2020’s high (17 January) to 23 March was the steepest (but not deepest) fall in the index’s 37-year history.

As the FTSE 100 tracks the overall performance of its members, it’s merely an average. And I say, “Averages invite comparisons”. Thus, some shares have soared, while others have crashed and burned.

The 27 winners Again, the main market index is down almost a fifth over the past six months. But there are six FTSE 100 shares with prices up between 31% and 88% since January. A portfolio of these six winners would be ahead by an average of 53% this year. Nice.

Then come nine shares with prices up by between 11% and 23% over six months. These stocks have easily beaten the wider FTSE 100. Next are 12 shares with positive, single-digit returns ranging from 1% to 9%. So far, that’s a total of 27 FTSE 100 members producing capital gains for their shareholders.

The 73 losers As there are actually 101 FTSE 100 shares, this leaves 74 shares. Removing one share not listed for six months leaves 73 shares. All 73 shares have fallen in value in six months. Yikes.

Fifteen shares are down by single digits. A further 22 have fallen 10% to 20%. Even so, these 37 shares have actually beaten or matched the FTSE 100’s near-20% loss. Further down are 14 shares diving 20% to 30%, plus 11 crashed between 30% and 40%.

The dogs of the FTSE 100 With 62 of 73 fallers accounted for, this leaves these 11 shares, the ‘dogs of the FTSE 100’ over six months:

Compass Group (LON: ) -40.5%

Royal Dutch Shell A (LON: ) -42.4%

Land Securities Group -42.9%

Royal Dutch Shell B -45.0%

NatWest Group -46.7%

Lloyds Banking Group (LON: ) -47.5%

Informa -50.1%

Melrose Industries -55.2%

ITV (LON: ) -55.4%

Rolls Royce (LON: ) Holdings -58.4%

International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON: ) -65.8%

IAG, owner of British Airways, is at the bottom. With no clear path to profitable air travel, I’d avoid its shares. Likewise for Rolls Royce, whose future is tied to airlines’ health. Ditto Melrose, whose shares crashed on Wednesday after awful forecasts.

Media companies Informa and ITV are struggling to attract customers and advertising (though I see deep value in ITV as a FTSE 100 takeover target). As a landlord, Land Securities is having a bad time collecting rents and faces big writedowns within its property portfolio. Compass Group can’t serve much food while entire workforces work from home.

My two picks from the dogs Of three remaining FTSE 100 candidates, my picks are Lloyds and Shell. I would buy Lloyds at 30.1p today. For the price of a pack of gum, you gain part-ownership of a £21.3bn bank with millions of customers. I can imagine Lloyds’ future dividend hitting 3p a year, a yearly cash return of roughly 10% at this price.

Shell is one of the world’s oil supermajors, employing 86,000 people across 70 countries. When Shell’s suspended dividend resumes, it might exceed 6% a year on today’s 1,207p share price.

In short, both Lloyds and Shell are attractive as value and future-dividend plays, which is why I’d happily buy both FTSE 100 shares today.

These are the stocks ISA millionaires are buying today, and maybe you should too

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio NG -1.50% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ATST +0.52% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

I recently looked at how the UK’s 1,000 or so ISA millionaires invest their money. In short, they go for a Stocks and Shares ISA, keep very little money in cash, and invest for the long term. I’ve now been having a closer peek at the individual shares ISA millionaires typically buy. And, tellingly, at what they do differently to most ISA investors.

Most ISA investors keep a surprisingly large amount of cash, earning pitiful annual interest. The average ISA millionaire appears to have only around 5% or 6% of their stash in cash. Most ISA investors tend to carry around twice that. Keeping too much cash is clearly a mistake.

All Stocks and Shares ISA investors allocate the biggest slice of their pies to individual shares, and I’m pleased to see that. I’ve looked at the various figures available, and around 50% of the average ISA portfolio is invested this way. The percentage doesn’t seem to vary much between millionaires and the rest of us, which might surprise you. But which shares are the most popular?

When it comes to individual shares, I see little difference. According to Interactive Investor, blue-chip dividend stocks figure strongly across the board. That’s with both ISA millionaires and ISA investors in general. We’re talking of giants like BP (LON: ) and Shell (LON: ), GlaxoSmithKline, National Grid (LON: ), and the like. These are stocks that we like a lot here at The Motley Fool.

ISA millionaires do it differently When I look at the other 50% or so of the typical Stocks and Shares ISA, I find something that surprises me, and in a good way. You can shelter fund investments in a Stocks and Shares ISA, and that accounts for the bulk of what’s left. But ISA millionaires diverge significantly from those less wealthy.

On average, the split between investment trusts and managed funds (in the form of unit trusts) is about half and half. That’s looking at all ISAs, millionaires or not. Now, I never put money in unit trusts, for one main reason. I don’t like handing over my cash to someone else to manage and charge me for the privilege. Even with honest managers, there’s a conflict of interest. Their motive is to maximise their own company’s profits rather than my nest egg.

Investment trusts When you buy shares in an investment trust instead, you own the company doing the management. So when the managers try to boost their company profits, that’s your company profits. ISA millionaires know this, and the bulk of their pooled investments goes into investment trusts. There’s very little money in unit trusts in the average millionaire’s ISA.

Which investment trusts do ISA millionaires favour? Going by Interactive Investor again, trusts like Alliance Trust (LON: ), Scottish Mortgage, and City of London are all popular. All three of those figure in the Association of Investment Companies‘ list of dividend heroes. To qualify, they need to have lifted their annual dividends for at least 20 years in a row. City of London and Alliance Trust have managed that feat for more than 50 straight years.

Emulating ISA millionaires The lesson for investors is actually quite cheery. On the whole, we’re doing most things right. But we could do better if we ditch cash and managed funds, and instead buy more top investment trusts.

This FTSE 100 ‘fallen giant’ is down 43% in a year. I’d buy this share today!

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HSBA -1.33% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LLOY -0.41% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio RR +0.13% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ITV -1.23% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ICAG -0.55% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

On Friday, I mentioned that the is almost a fifth lower over the past six months (down 1,425 points, or 19.2%). Interestingly, the UK’s main market index has slipped by a similar percentage (18.9%) over the past 12 months (it was roughly at the same level earlier this year as it had been last summer). As a value investor, this coincidence sent me sifting through the FTSE 100 to find its worst performers over one year.

37 FTSE 100 shares have risen As I’ve explained before, the Footsie tracks the overall performance of its 101 member shares (yes, 101 members as Shell lists both RDSA and RDSB shares). So it’s merely an average. Only by digging deeper do some interesting trends emerge.

For example, though the FTSE 100 has dived over 12 months, no fewer than 37 shares have climbed over the past year. Of these 37 risers, five recorded share-price gains of between 60.4% and 79.9%. A further six shares are up from 22.8% to 52.3%. Given the Covid-19 crisis, these are very impressive capital gains indeed.

Another 25 shares have beaten the index As two shares were not in the FTSE 100 a year ago, this leaves 62 shares to have lost ground over the past year. Of these 62 fallers, 25 have actually beaten the wider index, having dropped only between 1.5% and 18.7% in 12 months.

37 shares have underperformed the FTSE 100 This leaves 37 shares that have fallen more than the 18.9% drop recorded by the wider index. Of these, 12 are down between 19.5% and 29%. Another nine have slumped between 31.9% and 38.1%.

The FTSE 100’s dirty dozen The remaining 16 shares have crashed from 40.2% to 69.3%, with the ‘dirty dozen’ – the 12 biggest FTSE 100 fallers over the past year – shown below.

BP (LON: ) -43.1%

HSBC Holdings (LON: ) -44.4%

ITV (LON: ) -45.8%

Melrose Industries -46.8%

Lloyds Banking Group (LON: ) -47.9%

NatWest Group -49.6%

Royal Dutch Shell A (LON: ) -51.1%

Royal Dutch Shell B -53.1%

Evraz -53.3%

Informa -54.5%

International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON: ) -56.3%

Rolls Royce Holdings -69.3%

Somewhat unsurprisingly, my ‘dirty dozen’ are very similar to the dogs of the FTSE 100 over the past six months. These ailing companies’ business models have been hit for six by the coronavirus, with many seeing record falls in revenues and earnings.

Rolls-Royce (LON: ), British Airways owner IAG and Melrose have been clobbered by the collapse in air travel. Likewise, the three big banks (HSBC, Lloyds and NatWest) stand to lose tens of billions due to rising loan losses and defaults. Media companies Informa and ITV have similar issues – a lack of customers and/or advertising. Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich’s Evraz is also doing badly, thanks to falling demand for the miner’s raw materials.

This leaves three shares in two FTSE 100 companies: oil supermajors Royal Dutch Shell and BP (LSE: BP). I’d happily buy shares in either or both right now, but BP’s ongoing share-price weakness might make it a better bargain.

BP is my ‘best pick’ Right now, one BP share costs 298.1p, down 43.1% in 12 months. That’s a lower price than during the worst of the 2000/03 dotcom crash and the 2007/09 global financial crisis. In fact, it’s among the lowest prices BP shares have traded at since 1996.

For the record, BP shares have been as high as 556.2p over the past 12 months – almost double their current level. At the other end of the scale, BP’s share price collapsed to a mere 222.9p on 19 March, crashed by coronavirus and an accompanying oil-price slump.

But BP is a £60.2bn FTSE 100 giant that paid cash dividends totalling 32.67p over the past four quarters. At today’s price, that’s a dividend yield of 10.96%. Sure, BP may suspend or slash its quarterly dividends, but they will eventually return. Honestly, I dream of banking a return of anywhere near 11% a year, in cash, for a lifetime. That’s why I’d buy BP shares today.

Where will the BP and Royal Dutch Shell share prices be in 10 years?

BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

2020 has been a rough year for oil companies globally. A fatal combination of the coronavirus pandemic, the stock market crash and the price war has left oil stocks such as BP (LSE: LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) in tatters. Combine this with a shaky oil market, and it’s clear to see why investor sentiment toward the supermajors has deteriorated.

However, what about the long-term prospects for these companies? Well, as you may know, here at The Motley Fool, we place a great deal of emphasis on long-term investing. So, looking ahead, where could the BP and Shell share prices be 10 years from now?

The future of the oil industry Taking a macro view of the industry in which these two companies operate is key to determining their future prospects. In a world where environmental concerns are of paramount significance, the oil industry is not particularly looked upon favourably. On top of this, demand for oil has fallen substantially over the period of the pandemic, with widespread lockdowns taking their toll on consumption.

While oil is likely to remain a large and important part of the broader energy mix for the foreseeable future, the long-term outlook for the industry is far from certain. In any case, oil exploration is an expensive and risky business that requires monumental investment. It’s also a business that faces less incentive to operate the lower the price of oil is.

The focus for many is now firmly upon seeking to develop lower-carbon technologies and renewable energy alternatives. How successful this will be remains to be seen. Nevertheless, I think both BP and Shell would do well to position themselves wisely to capitalise on these shifting trends.

Diversification towards renewables In recognition of the fact that oil prices look set to be lower over the long term, both BP and Shell have reduced the value of their assets, particularly those related to exploration. The revised price forecasts illustrate that both businesses are gearing up to face weaker demand and lower prices in the long run.

Additionally, both have taken huge steps in the direction of investing in cleaner sources of energy. For example, BP’s flagship renewable project, Lightsource, is focused on the delivery of solar and other smart energy solutions. What’s more, the company is now in possession of multiple wind and biofuel assets. Meanwhile, Shell has been pouring tens of billions of dollars into diversification towards renewables and now has various green energy supply agreements with institutions around the world.

10-year outlook At 305p and 1,224p, both the BP and Shell share prices offer value in my eyes. But, where do I think their respective valuations will be in 10 years? Well, it’s tricky to offer a precise figure. If demand for the commodity recovers to pre-pandemic levels and investment into renewables continues, I reckon both companies’ share prices could rise. Hypothetically, assuming a modest annual return of 5% would result in valuations of 497p and 1,994p in a decade.

Remember though, both companies boast a bulky yield, meaning that dividend payments would significantly swell the size of the investment. As such, through a combination of share price appreciation and dividends, investors in it for the long term could realise an attractive return in the years to come, I feel.

By Sabrina Valle and Marianna Parraga

RIO DE JANEIRO/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Brazil increased crude exports to Asia in the first half of the year, stealing a slice of a coveted developing market from global rivals who made record cuts to shipments to match the unprecedented fall in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The rise reflects Brazil's growing clout among global oil producers as its massive offshore projects come online. Brazil is expected to deliver one of the biggest increases to global supply in the next five years from nations outside of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, according to the International Energy Agency.

State oil firm Petrobras (SA: ) offered Asian refiners competitive deals on relatively high-quality oil just as China and other countries in the region reopened their economies and as Western nations went into lockdowns to curb the spread of coronavirus, traders said.

China also took advantage of the lowest oil prices in decades to fill up strategic storage.""If we had more oil available, China would buy it,"" Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco told Reuters in a written response to questions.

Castello Branco said there was no more to sell to further boost exports, because demand in Brazil has been recovering.

China is now the destination for 70% of the country's exports, Petrobras said in a statement to Reuters.

Asia imported an average of 1.07 million barrels per day of oil from Brazil in the first half of the year, 30% year-on-year hike, according to Refinitiv Eikon's trade flows data.

A record 1.62 million bpd of Brazilian crude arrived in Asian ports in June, almost triple the volume in June 2019, according to the data. (Graphic showing Asia's oil imports from Latin America: https://graphics.reuters.com/OIL-LATAM/ASIA/azgvorqzjpd)

Asian refiners were keen for the low-sulfur oil that Brazil sells, as they sought to comply with new maritime regulations to supply ships with cleaner fuel. The oil is from Brazil's prolific offshore deposits known as pre-salt fields, which Petrobras and oil majors are spending hundreds of billions of dollars to develop.

That offered Petrobras an opportunity to grow its market even as OPEC and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+, cut supplies by a record 9.7 million bpd.

Petrobras is confident that the quality of its oil will enable it to defend its enlarged market share in Asia even as global producers begin pumping more oil.

""There was a well-planned strategy to expand oil sales in the Asian market,"" the company said. ""Even if OPEC+ restores production levels, we believe that this will have little impact on exports.""

The increased exports also meant Petrobras had no need to lease tankers just to store crude, a costly option that rivals worldwide were forced to take as demand plummeted during lockdowns and refiners no longer wanted their oil.

Brazil's rise came as rival Latin American producers ceded ground. Asia's crude imports from sanctions-hit Venezuela fell by 35% in the same period, while purchases from Mexico dropped 9.5%, the data showed.

Brazil's crude also displaced some West African supplies in China and India, according to data from those countries.

The rebound in consumption in recent months in Brazil is leaving less crude for export, so international sales may not rise further in the second half of the year.

""China should stop rebuilding stocks in the coming months and fuel demand in Brazil will recover,"" said Marcelo de Assis, head of Latin America Upstream Research at Wood Mackenzie.

OTHER PRODUCERS

International oil companies operating in Brazil followed Petrobras' lead to avoid filling up storage and making supply cuts, traders working with local crudes said.

Brazil has boosted total output to a record 2.97 million bpd so far this year, up from 2.6 million bpd in the same period of 2019. That makes it the top producer in Latin America.

International companies, including Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Total (PA: ), produce around a quarter of Brazil's oil.

Brazil's production is set to double by 2030, according to the country's National Petroleum Association. Oil companies including Exxon Mobil (N: ) will see their share of output grow as they develop areas acquired in recent years.

In April, Petrobras alone exported more than 1 million bpd to Asia, or 145% above the same month of 2019, with around two thirds bound for China.

""Our product is getting lot of recognition in Asia,"" Petrobras Chief Financial Officer Andrea Almeida said in a webinar earlier this month.

NEW BENCHMARK

Brazil's Lula crude is slowly replacing Venezuela's Merey and Mexico's Maya crudes as the flagship grade from Latin America in Asia.

Brazilian oil is lighter and sweeter than rival grades in Latin America, and the price is closely tied to global benchmark .

Traders were last week offering Lula for delivery in China at a premium of about $3 per barrel above Brent, according to two sources.

Mexico is losing ground in Asia as it tries to increase exports to the United States. It is also refining more of its crude domestically to curb fuel imports.Until the end of 2018, Venezuela was Latin America's largest supplier to Asia. But shipments have plummeted to a nearly 80-year low as U.S. sanctions prevent refiners from buying Venezuelan oil.

It made no sense for Brazil, which is not a member of OPEC+, to cut exports just as projects were expanding, said Wood Mackenzie's Assis.

""If you're ramping up production in some fields, like Brazil is, it doesn't make sense to cut production to meet lower demand, because it costs more,"" Assis said.

""It is worthy to fight for market share.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/brazil-boosts-oil-exports-to-asia-as-global-rivals-make-record-cuts-2165498,0.069,0.891,0.04,-0.9746

By Kate Abnett and Shadia Nasralla

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union does not plan to crack down on planet-warming methane emissions from gas imports despite pressure from oil companies, activists and academics, according to its draft strategy and sources familiar with the matter.

While the EU plans to impose carbon dioxide (CO2) taxes on imports of energy intensive goods, critics say the world's biggest gas importer is not targeting suppliers of the fuel hard enough in its methane strategy due to be unveiled this year.

This comes despite an unlikely alliance of big oil firms, environmental activists, investors and researchers pushing the bloc to plug this hole in its methane plan and punish gas producers that fail to rein in their emissions.

While the EU regulates methane emissions from gas burned in the bloc, it doesn't regulate emissions during the production or transport of gas imported by Europe. That means those emissions don't show up in the tally of greenhouse gases linked to Europe's gas-fuelled power plants, nor are they are counted in the EU's climate goals.

The draft methane plan, which may be subject to change, says the European Commission will propose legislation requiring gas firms to better monitor and report methane emissions, but it does not include setting methane standards for imported gas.

The Commission, the European Union's executive, declined to comment on unpublished documents.

Campaigners say the omission of imported emissions risks undermining the EU's climate policy as methane is 100 times more potent than CO2 when it first goes into the atmosphere.

""Setting clear product standard requirements on all gas sold in the EU's internal market is essentially a global climate opportunity with significant potential to curb global methane emissions from oil and gas quickly,"" said Poppy Kalesi, global energy policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF (PA: )).

It teamed up with seven European oil firms - BP (LON: ), Eni, Equinor, Repsol (MC: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), Total and Wintershall DEA - to ask Brussels to address what they see as a blind spot in its climate plans.

Sources familiar with the Commission's thinking say it has not shifted its position on regulating methane emissions from imported gas since compiling the draft.

(GRAPHIC: EU gas imports by origin - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/qzjpqeblmpx/EU%20gas%20imports.png)

Gas production is associated with emissions of methane, which leaches into the atmosphere from leaky pipelines and infrastructure at oil and gas fields.

The EU imported about 80% of the gas it consumed last year. Almost three-quarters of its imports came from Russia, Norway and Algeria, with Russia's Gazprom (MCX: ) by far the biggest non-EU supplier.

Methane is 100 times more powerful than CO2 as a global warming gas, but it degrades while CO2 remains in the atmosphere. Over a 20-year period, methane is 86 times more powerful though that drops to 34 times over 100 years.

SATELLITE FINDINGS

Analysis of satellite imagery and other aerial surveillance over the past few years has shown that oil and gas industry leaks are responsible for far more of the methane in the atmosphere than previously thought.

The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, whose members have 30 trillion euros ($34 trillion) of assets under management, wrote to the Commission in May asking it to propose rules this year to ban gas with a methane leakage rate in upstream supply chains of more than 0.25% by 2025.

U.S. lobby groups EDF and the Rocky Mountain Institute, the Florence School of Regulation research centre and the European oil companies also wrote to the Commission in May, recommending ""a methane intensity-based performance standard applied to the upstream segment of the supply chains from 2025"".

Their letter called for: ""A procurement standard to be applied from 2025 to incentivise the continual reduction of the methane emissions intensity of the gas entering domestic and import supply chains.""

A Commission official said by focusing its proposals on monitoring and reporting emissions, the aim was to get a handle on the issue.

""The main thing is to get a good picture of where the methane is actually coming from,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Campaigners fear this approach could delay plans to regulate imported emissions and say there is sufficient data to design such policies.

Andris Piebalgs, professor at the Florence School of Regulation and a former EU energy commissioner, said any indication that Brussels will integrate international methane emissions into its policy would be a substantial step forward.

""Because at this stage, it's not ... much discussed at all.""

For European oil and gas firms, tackling methane emissions could help them make the case that gas can play a role in Europe's shift to ""net zero"" emissions by 2050 at a time when investors are increasingly focused on their climate performance.

European oil companies that have invested to curb their own methane emissions may also be wary about being undercut by producers outside the bloc who haven't done the same.

BENEFIT WIPED OUT

Gas is far from being a zero emissions fuel but it produces roughly half the CO2 emissions of coal when burned in power plants and is seen by Eastern European countries such as Poland as a transition fuel to wean themselves off coal.

But methane leaks can quickly dent this argument.

""When you get to about 3% leakage, the entire benefit of gas as a lower-emissions fuel is entirely wiped out. So we're operating in a relatively small window of gas actually being better than coal,"" said Frank Jotzo, director of the centre for climate economics and policy at Australian National University.

The International Energy Agency says a third of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry could be saved at no net cost, as the captured gas could be sold.

However, EU methane standards for gas imports could rile large suppliers, especially if it restricts their access to the European market.

""As 40% of EU gas imports stem from Russia, dealing with methane emissions means dealing with Gazprom,"" said Esther Bollendorff, EU gas policy coordinator at the non-profit Climate Action Network, referring to Russia's state-owned gas producer.

Gazprom is Europe's largest gas supplier and owns pipelines transporting the fuel to Europe. Last year, it sold almost 200 billion cubic metres of gas to countries in Europe and Turkey.

In a June 10 statement about emissions, Gazprom estimated that 0.29% of the 679 billion cubic metres of gas it moved through its pipelines escaped as methane in 2019 and said this corresponded to the best global practices.

Some observers said the slump in EU gas consumption this year during coronavirus lockdowns meant the bloc was less dependent on gas suppliers and was in a stronger position to push them to tackle methane emissions.

""The EU has the power now,"" said Lisa Fischer, senior policy adviser at the climate change think-tank E3G.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/eus-greenhouse-gas-strategy-fails-to-plug-methane-hole-2164310,0.037,0.899,0.064,0.9865

LONDON (Reuters) - Spanish energy major Repsol (MC: ) lowered its oil price ( ) assumptions on Thursday, bringing its long-term outlook in line with most European rivals which have booked writedowns and leaving Equinor as a bullish outlier in the sector.

Repsol took a writedown of $1.5 billion in second-quarter results, after it had already booked 5.7 billion euros (5.1 billion pounds) in upstream asset impairments last year.

It had previously assumed oil prices might reach $87 a barrel in 2035, adjusting for inflation, but has now revised its headline figure to an average of $59.6 a barrel until 2050 in this year's prices.

Equinor (OL: ) forecasts oil prices to jump to around $80 a barrel in 2030, in 2019 prices.

This month, Eni (MI: ) announced a 3.5 billion euro impairment on the value of its assets after revising down its long-term oil price outlook.

That came on the back of Royal Dutch Shell's (L: ) $22 billion writedown last week and BP 's (L: ) $17.5 billion hit in June.

While break-even prices for new development projects typically lie below future oil price assumptions, these writedowns have raised questions about the risk of stranded assets - or resources that are left underground because they are uneconomical to tap - in the oil and gas sector.

Here is a graphic showing the varying oil price assumptions among European energy majors:

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) shut on Saturday the gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracker (FCC) at its 318,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) joint-venture Deer Park, Texas, refinery after a fire, sources familiar with plant operations said on Sunday.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors have asked for oil majors Eni (MI: ) and Shell (L: ) to be fined and some of their present and former executives, including Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi, to be jailed in a long-running trial over alleged corruption in Nigeria.

In one of the oil industry's biggest alleged scandals, Italian prosecutors allege Eni and Shell acquired a Nigerian oilfield in 2011, knowing most of the $1.3 billion purchase price would go to politicians and middlemen in bribes.

In a Milan court, prosecutors asked on Tuesday for eight years in prison for Descalzi and seven years and four months for Shell's former head of upstream Malcolm Brinded.

The prosecutors also asked for Eni and Shell to be fined 900,000 euros each and sought to confiscate a total of $1.092 billion from all the defendants in the case, the equivalent of the bribes alleged to have been paid.

All the defendants have denied any wrongdoing, saying the purchase price was paid into an official Nigerian government account with all subsequent transfers being beyond their control.

Eni said the prosecutors' request was unfounded and it would show the company and managers had acted completely correctly. ""Eni is confident that the truth will ultimately be established"" when the defence presents its arguments in September, it said in a statement.

Shell issued a statement saying it did not believe there was a basis to convict the company or any of its former employees. ""There is no place for bribery or corruption in our company,"" Shell's statement said.

Shell has said the 2011 agreement was a settlement of long-standing litigation, following the previous allocation of the block by the Nigerian government to Shell and Malabu, a company owned by former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete.

Another 11 people are involved in the case, including former Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni, for whom prosecutors also sought an eight year sentence.

(Reuters) - The British blue-chip index ended down on Monday with energy stocks tracking a decline in oil prices, while AstraZeneca marked its strongest close ever on optimism over its COVID-19 vaccine.

The commodity-heavy FTSE 100 index ( ) was down 0.5% on the day, with BP Plc (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) among the biggest drags as oil prices fell in anticipation of weaker demand.

Heavyweight drugmaker AstraZeneca (L: ) helped cap some losses, rising 1.5% after data showed its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was safe and produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials in healthy volunteers.

Still, the stock ended largely off an intra-day record high hit in anticipation of its announcement.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) closed 0.2% higher, propped up by Future PLC (L: ). The media firm surged more than 15% after it forecast annual performance to be at the top end of market expectations.

""Following the (steep rise) from March lows, markets need another dose of positive news to keep the rally going, but given the many uncertainties ahead, the risks seem tilted to the downside,"" said Hussein Sayed, market strategist at FXTM.

The FTSE 100 has bounced about 27% following a coronavirus-driven crash in March, but the pace of gains has slowed since June amid fears of a slower-than-expected global economic recovery.

A recent survey showed that nearly half of Britain's biggest companies think they will take until the second half of 2021 before businesses recover from the pandemic.

Among individual movers for the day, Marks and Spencer (L: ), one of Britain's best known high-street names, fell slightly on a report that it planned to announce hundreds of job cuts in the coming week.

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

The index has recovered fast from the stock market crash. It’s up 8% from March, the month of the crash. Clearly, this means that FTSE 100 companies’ share prices have gained as well. While that’s good news, making us investors heave a collective sigh of relief, there’s a downside here too. Bargain buys, that were a dime a dozen when the crash happened, are becoming increasingly hard to find.

But there’s one big FTSE 100 stock that’s in the doldrums, thanks to the ongoing recession, making it a great bargain buy in my view. I’m talking about the oil biggie Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB), whose share price has actually fallen since March. July is turning out to be its worst month in 2020. This shouldn’t surprise, though.

Recession drags down oil demand An economic slowdown hits cyclical stocks in any case. Oil demand is dependent on growth in activity, so a slowing down in economic activity reduces it. The current slowdown is no different so far. If anything, it’s worse for oil companies. The lockdowns sharply reduced travel and business demand, with ripple effects across multiple industries, including oil.

This has shown up in RDSB’s financials. It reduced dividend payouts as the slowdown hit and more recently, it warned that the value of its assets could decrease a fair bit. This is bad news with oil prices expected to remain low. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), petroleum prices are expected to average $36.2 in 2020 and $37.5 in 2021. This is below the current $41 level.

Bargain buy for the patient investor So why am I making a case for investing in RDSB at all? It’s because I believe that once the dust has settled and growth returns, Shell will come out ahead. It’s quite likely that it’s current share price will look like a bargain buy then. Think about this – Shell has been around for the longest time, and has survived multiple recessions.

Also, as the economy recovers, oil demand will rise. In fact, it may be one of the first leading indicators of growth. As people make their way back to regular office travel and the wheels of business, particularly industrial activity, start turning again, oil demand will rise again. Indeed, it already has, going by the inching up in oil prices. For investors with patience to wait a few years, it’s quite likely to be a bargain buy in hindsight.

Comparing with BP (LON: ) Another way to think about RDSB’s future trajectory is to consider its FTSE 100 peer, BP, which has recovered since the stock market crash. There are differences between the two companies, of course. BP’s dividend yield, for instance, is more than twice that of RDSB’s, at 4.1%. RDSB’s dividend levels might have been looking hard to maintain even before the corona-crisis struck, but, BP’s is on thin ice too. With a big loss in the latest quarter its dividend can’t be depended on. Yet, its share price is in a healthy place while RDSB’s is struggling. In this context, RDSB appears to be a clear bargain buy.

The last time I covered Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) shares was on 10 March. At the time, Shell’s share price had just crashed spectacularly due to plunging oil prices and the oil price war that had erupted between Saudi Arabia and Russia. My view back then was that Shell’s share price weakness was a buying opportunity.

Fast forward to today, and Shell’s share price is actually lower than it was when I covered the stock in March. Did I get it wrong? Let’s take another look at the investment case for Shell.

Shell shares: can they recover? Since my last article, the outlook for Shell has improved to a degree. Many countries are slowly coming out of lockdown and, as a result, demand for oil is picking up. China, for example, imported approximately 13m barrels per day (mb/d) in June, a record high.

As you can see in the chart below, the price of has rebounded significantly since April.

Source: Trading Economics

This rebound in the oil price is good news for Shell, as higher prices translate to higher cash flows and profits for oil companies.

Shell share price: an uncertain future However, in terms of a recovery in Shell’s share price, there are a few other issues to consider. The first is Shell’s dividend. In the past, Shell was seen as a very dependable income stock that both private and institutional investors relied on for consistent dividends.

The situation is now very different. In its first-quarter results, Shell did the unthinkable and cut its dividend (for the first time since World War II). It was a significant cut too, with the payout reduced by 66%.

That kind of cut is likely to impact sentiment. No longer is Shell a rock-solid income stock.

Additionally, that cut says something about the challenges Shell’s facing. Analysts at Credit Suisse (SIX: ) recently said the dividend cut is reflective of times to come, with “a harsh operating environment in the near term and slower recovery over the medium term.”

Another issue that could hold Shell’s share price back is uncertainty in relation to future oil demand. In the short term, people are less likely to travel internationally due to Covid-19. Meanwhile, the work-from-home trend means people may travel less on a permanent basis. This potentially translates to lower demand for oil. This could hurt Shell’s share price going forward.

Finally, it’s also worth thinking about today’s focus on sustainable investing. Increasingly, institutional investors are investing on a sustainable basis as that’s what their clients are looking for. Shell cannot be considered a sustainable stock. This means it may not generate the same kind of investor interest that it has in the past.

Are RDSB shares worth buying? Shell’s share price could still rebound. However, a sustained recovery is far from guaranteed, given the many challenges the company faces today.

I own Shell shares and will hold on to them, for now. However, I think there are much better stocks than Shell to buy today.

Instead of investing in an industry that’s set to experience challenges in the near term, I’d be looking at buying high-quality stocks in industries that are set for growth in the years ahead.

2020 has been a year to forget for dividend investors. And we are not even at the back end of summer yet! Record payouts were delivered for another year in 2019. But the coronavirus outbreak has smashed the chances of another all-time high this time around. Even the most robust dividend stocks have had to cut, cancel or suspend payouts in response to the crisis.

Around half of constituents have already taken the hatchet to dividends in anticipation of an economic storm. Even alumni like Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) — a blue-chip that hadn’t cut shareholder rewards since World War 2 — have been forced into drastic action. A look at the deteriorating balance sheets of UK-quoted companies suggests that more trusted dividend stocks will be shaking up their payout policies too.

UK debt balloons According to a study by global asset management group Janus Henderson, corporate debts are surging all over the globe. The total hit a record $8.3bn in 2019, it says, up 8% from the prior year. It was driven by “debt-financed acquisitions, large share buybacks, record dividends, and the chilling effect on profits caused by trade tensions and a global economic slowdown.”

Debt levels on the books of UK companies really exploded at an even faster rate. Net debt across London-listed firms rocketed 10% year on year to $539bn, Janus Henderson notes. According to the report, “ Vodafone (LON: ) was responsible for half the increase, funding its acquisition of Liberty Global (NASDAQ: ), while Shell borrowed heavily to help fund its $15bn dividend.”

Careful now This debt boom clearly couldn’t have come at a worse time given the current Covid-19 crisis. On the plus side, Janus Henderson notes that “half the UK companies in our index reduced their borrowings last year.” That should give investors some crumb of comfort. Though of course, buying dividend stocks still needs to be treated with extra care right now.

Investors need to pay extra attention to net debt levels as well as free cash flows when choosing dividend stocks. It’s also important to consider how well their operations can weather a global economic downturn and therefore how profits growth is likely to turn out. Another useful thing to consider is dividend cover. This looks at how many times over predicted dividends are covered by anticipated earnings.

A top FTSE 100 dividend stock So which UK dividend stocks would I buy based on this criteria? Well let me give you an example. I have my eye on BAE Systems (LON: ) and its 4.6% forward dividend yield. Net debt is falling (down 18% in 2019), free is cash booming, and it can rely on its recession-resistant businesses to continue driving profits over the medium term. To put a cherry on the cake its predicted dividend for 2020 is covered a healthy 1.9 times over by estimated earnings.

Investors need to be especially careful when buying dividend stocks today. But rising debts and a global downturn don’t mean that there are no brilliant income shares to be bought. In fact, the stock market crash allows us to buy top dividend stocks (like BAE Systems) at a hefty discount. You just need to know where to look.

LONDON (Reuters) - The global economy will not achieve a v-shaped recovery after the coronavirus epidemic, which will curtail oil and gas demand for years, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: )'s chief executive said.

Ben van Beurden told an online interview with IHS Markit Chairman Dan Yergin that it was too early to know if demand for oil had peaked.

""Energy demand, and certainty mobility demand, will be lower even when this crisis is more or less behind us. Will it mean that it will never recover? It is probably too early to say, but it will have a permanent knock for years,"" he said.

""It is most likely not going to be a v-shaped recovery.""

The rapid growth in consumption of and liquefied natural gas in recent years has also been stalled, van Beurden said.

The weaker demand outlook and subsequent drop in gas prices have meant that the likes of Shell and others had to reduce spending sharply and postpone large amounts of investment ""for some time to come"".

Shell is the world's largest LNG trader and had planned to increase its output in the coming years, including in North America, where natural gas has become abundant because of the shale gas revolution.

But van Beurden said that major gas projects such as North American LNG plants no longer look as strong as they did previously.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/global-recovery-unlikely-to-be-vshaped-says-shell-chief-2163865,0.088,0.828,0.084,0.601

LONDON (Reuters) - A group of the world's top oil companies, including Saudi Aramco , China's CNPC and Exxon Mobil , have for the first time set goals to cut their greenhouse gas emissions as a proportion of output, as pressure on the sector's climate stance grows.

But the target, set by the 12 members of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), means absolute emissions can rise as production increases.

It is eclipsed by more ambitious plans set individually by the consortium's European members, including Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Total .

""It is a significant milestone, it is not the end of the work, it is a near term target ... and we'll keep calibrating as we go forward,"" OGCI Chairman and former BP CEO Bob Dudley told Reuters.

The OGCI members agreed to reduce the average carbon intensity of their aggregated upstream oil and gas operations to between 20 kg and 21 kg of CO2 equivalent per barrel of oil equivalent (CO2e/boe) by 2025, from a collective baseline of 23 kg CO2e/boe in 2017, the OGCI said in a statement.

The OGCI includes BP (L: ), Chevron (N: ), CNPC, Eni (MI: ), Equinor (OL: ), Exxon (N: ), Occidental Petroleum (N: ), Petrobras (SA: ), Repsol (MC: ), Saudi Aramco (SE: ), Shell (L: ) and Total (PA: ), which together account for over 30% of the world's oil and gas production.

The members agreed on a common methodology to calculate carbon intensity and the targets could be extended to other sectors, such as liquefied and refining in the future, Dudley said.

London-based environmental thinktank Carbon Tracker dismissed the OGCI's claim the targets were in line with the 2015 U.N.-backed Paris agreement to limit global warming by the end of the century.

""Having some targets to reduce carbon pollution is better than none,"" Carbon Tracker's head of oil, gas and coal Andrew Grant said in a statement.

But ""the (oil and gas) industry can never consider itself 'aligned' with the Paris goals when business plans assume steady investment in fossil fuel production on a planet with absolute limits"".

The announcement marks an important change for Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, which has resisted investor pressure to improve the disclosure of its environmental impact. It did not report its carbon emissions in 2019.

Exxon supports the OGCI targets to decrease the carbon intensity of energy production and is ""part of the industry's efforts to take practical, meaningful steps to reduce emissions,"" a spokesman said.

The targets set by different companies can vary widely in scope and definition, making comparison difficult.

Some members of the OGCI already exceed or plan to overshoot the joint target.

For example, Saudi Aramco, the world's top oil exporter, had an upstream carbon intensity of 10.1kg CO2e/boe in 2019, its annual report showed.

Norway's Equinor aims to reduce its CO2 intensity to below 8kg/boe by 2025. It has said the global industry average is 18 kg CO2e/boe.

OGCI said the group's collective carbon intensity would be reported annually, with data reviewed by EY, as an independent third party.

The target includes reductions in methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, which the group had previously committed to cut.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/oil-giants-including-exxon-set-first-joint-carbon-target-2163390,0.018,0.907,0.075,0.9893

(Bloomberg) -- Oil refineries aren’t being spared as Covid-19 sweeps through Texas, which is setting records for new infections and hospitalizations in the U.S. almost daily.

The second-biggest U.S. refinery, Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE: ).’s Galveston Bay plant in Texas City, has well over 100 confirmed cases of the virus, people familiar with operations said. At least four other refineries also have workers who’ve tested positive.

Texas on Wednesday posted its second record day of virus deaths, bringing total fatalities in the state to 2,813. Virus cases rose 4.7%, exceeding the seven-day average of 4% and hospitalizations jumped 3.5%.

The outbreak at the 585,000 barrel-a-day Galveston Bay plant comes as employees there are wrapping up a major turnaround that brought in more than 500 contractors. Work remains on schedule to be competed within about 2 weeks, the people said.

“We have procedures and protocols in place at all our refineries for keeping the workplace safe, which includes measures to identify, isolate, and trace cases to stem the spread of the virus,” spokeswoman Sid Barth said.

In Houston, the epicenter of Texas’s virus resurgence, about 50 employees and contractors at LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE: ) NV’s refinery tested positive as of two weeks ago, while 17 others had been placed in quarantine, a person familiar with the situation said. The plant processes 263,776 barrels a day of crude. The company declined to comment on its Covid-19 cases but said that none have been work-related.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc’s Deer Park refinery on the Houston Ship Channel had nine workers test positive so far this week for a total of 50 since the start of the outbreak, spokesman Curtis Smith said. The number of workers at the plant, which processes 275,000 barrels of oil a day, remains at about 34% of its pre-pandemic level of 3,500.

Phillips 66 (NYSE: ) confirmed it had virus cases at its 265,000 barrel-a-day Sweeny refinery but declined to share details, citing privacy concerns. Monitoring, isolation or quarantine is taking place as necessary, the company said in a statement.

Total SA (NYSE: ) has had “a number of positive Covid-19 cases” in some of its U.S. sites including its refinery in Port Arthur, spokeswoman Marie Maitre said. Workers there are screened upon entering the site, wear face coverings and work staggered shifts to achieve social distancing.

At 1,250p I think the Shell share price is a buy

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Investor sentiment towards the Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) share price has deteriorated significantly over the past six months. As investors have become concerned about the outlook for the group, they’ve pushed the stock down to 1,250p.

However, despite this performance, the company’s long-term outlook remains attractive. As such, now could be a good time for long-term investors to snap up the Shell share price while it trades at a depressed level.

Shell share price on offer Investors have been selling the Shell share price this year for a multitude of reasons. For a start, the price of oil has plunged in value as demand for the black gold has collapsed. On top of this, the company has had to cut its dividend to preserve its balance sheet. For investors who’ve relied on the group to provide a steady stream of dividends in the past, this came as a complete shock.

Nevertheless, despite these headwinds, the Shell share price appears to have a bright future. While it’s clear the world is moving away from oil and gas towards cleaner fuel sources, this doesn’t mean Shell is nearing the end of its life.

The group is spending tens of billions of dollars diversifying its operations. A key pillar of this strategy is turning the company into one of the world’s largest energy providers. This includes both traditional hydrocarbon and renewable energy.

To this end, the group has recently signed a significant renewable energy supply agreement with one of the largest financial institutions in the US. It’s also launched a retail energy business in the UK, an offshore energy partnership, and signed biogas supply agreements. These are just some of the efforts the company is pursuing to secure its future. Progress on this front could help improve investor sentiment towards the Shell share price.

And while income investors may see the dividend cut as a black mark against the business, the reduction will free up cash for more green energy investment. In terms of the long-term potential of the company, that seems to be a sensible trade-off.

Income champion Even though the Shell share price doesn’t offer the same level of income as it did at the beginning of the year, the stock remains a dividend champion. The dividend yield is currently 6%, which is extremely attractive in the current income environment. It also suggests that, as investor sentiment improves, the Shell share price could rise significantly from current levels, thanks to its income credentials.

As such, at 1,250p the Shell share price may be an excellent acquisition for a diversified portfolio. The firm’s green energy efforts and dividend credentials suggest it could produce high total returns for shareholders. That’s despite the near-term headwinds facing the enterprise.

(Reuters) - London's was weighed down by energy stocks on Thursday as oil prices weakened and a rise in coronavirus cases in major global economies dented broader sentiment.

The bulk of the day's losses came late in the session, tracking a drop in Wall Street as infection rates increased the possibility of new lockdowns in the world's largest economy.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 closed 1.7% lower in its worst day since June 24, with BP (LON: ) PLc and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc among those bearing the brunt of the falls.

The domestically-focused midcap index ended the day 1.2% lower.

Aerospace engineer Rolls-Royce (LON: ) fell nearly 11% after it said it had burned through 3 billion pounds in its first-half as the COVID-19 pandemic halved the hours flown by its engines.

Telecommunication major Vodafone (LON: ) shed more than 2% after it said would cost ""single figure billions"" of pounds to remove equipment made by China's Huawei, if the government were to demand that, as tensions mount between China and the west.

""Risk appetite is struggling as the coronavirus spread is still not under control in most parts of the world and as geopolitical tensions between China and the West intensify,"" Edward Moya, Senior Market Analyst, New York, OANDA, wrote in a note.

Local stocks have come under pressure from safe-haven flows to gold and bonds, stifling a recovery seen over the second quarter of the year.

(Reuters) - European stocks closed sharply lower on Thursday as Wall Street tumbled after another record surge in U.S. coronavirus cases that raised fears of fresh lockdowns.

London stocks ( ) were among the biggest casualties in Europe, sliding 1.7%, with energy firms BP (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) down about 4% as oil prices plunged on worries about fuel demand.

The main indexes in Paris ( ), Milan ( ) and Madrid ( ) fell between 1.2% and 2%, while Frankfurt-listed shares ( ) closed flat as software giant SAP (DE: ) jumped 4.6% after confirming its full-year outlook.

After hovering in positive territory until afternoon trading, the broader European index lost ground and closed down 0.8% to hit a one-week low.

The United States reported more than 60,000 new COVID-19 infections on Wednesday, setting a single-day global record, while government data showed another 1.3 million Americans filed for jobless benefits.

""Risk appetite is struggling as the coronavirus spread is still not under control in most parts of the world and as geopolitical tensions between China and the West intensify,"" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda.

A U.S. official told Reuters the Trump administration planned to finalise regulations that will bar the government from buying goods or services from any company that uses products from China's Huawei and others.

Technology stocks ( ) registered the only sector rise in Europe, up 0.9%, while banks ( ) and utilities ( ) fell nearly 2%.

Investors are also awaiting the onset of second-quarter earnings season, with analysts predicting companies listed on the will record a near 54% drop in profits, according to Refinitiv data.

For income investors, 2020 will be a dividend drought

In mid-February, investment firm Janus Henderson published its usual quarterly global dividend review.

2020, judged the firm, looked set to deliver a fifth consecutive year of record dividends, with global payouts totalling of $1.48 trillion expected, some 3.9% higher than 2019.

But that was then; this is now.

Three months on, the more sober assessment of 2020 contained in the firm’s latest global dividend review is a great deal more downbeat. Its best case scenario sees a decline in global dividends of 15% this year to $1.21 trillion, a drop of $213bn. Its worst case scenario sees a decline of 35%, $933bn.

In hindsight, it’s easy to be critical. For a review published in mid-February to contain not a single mention of the words ‘coronavirus’, ‘Covid-19’, or ‘pandemic’ seems in retrospect a little shortsighted.

But hey, plenty of other people have also been wrong about Covid-19. Most of us, in fact, one way or another.

Global perspective If you’re not familiar with the quarterly Janus Henderson reviews, they’re worth checking out.

Basically, they take a country-by-country, region-by-region bottom-up focus to dividend projection, looking at business conditions, trade, economic growth and other factors bearing on corporate earnings.

So while they’re similar in many ways to the familiar re-branded Capita UK-only forecasts that are now published under the name of Link Asset Services, they’re a little more forward-looking.

Different outcomes But let’s go back for a moment to those best-case and worse-case scenarios — and in particular, to that worse-case scenario projecting a 35% decline in global dividend income in 2020.

Obviously, it’s a figure that could be wrong: frankly, no one knows. But accepting it at face value for moment, it’s worth comparing with Link Asset Services’ own UK-specific forecast, which projects UK dividend income falling by more than half.

Obviously, Link Asset Services’ figures could be wrong, too, but the contrast between the two estimates is difficult to ignore.

Global equity income investors are going to see a worst-case fall in income of around 35%; UK equity income-investors are going to see a fall of 55% or so. That’s quite a gap.

Footsie fallout A lot of UK equity income investors have portfolios heavily biased to the upper reaches of the . That’s not surprising, of course, and apart from anything else reflects the prominent role of big dividend payers such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), HSBC, GlaxoSmithKline, and British American Tobacco (LON: ). The trouble is that a number of these dividend stalwarts have abruptly fallen — or been pushed, in HSBC’s case — off their pedestals. Overall, last time I looked, some 45% of the FTSE 100 had cancelled, reduced, or delayed their dividend payments. Including two of the four above: Shell, slashing by two-thirds; and HSBC, cutting completely. Thankfully, my own investments have been buffered by some judicious holdings of industrial REITs and a number of investment trusts. Even so, I’ve not been immune.

Overseas earnings There are good reasons for Janus Henderson to expect some other regions of the world to be less badly affected by the coronavirus crisis, from a dividend-paying perspective. Their sectoral and regional analysis, covering several pages, is persuasive. Time will tell if the firm’s reasoning was valid.

What’s beyond argument, though, is that global income investors are going to be a lot more diversified than UK-only income investors. Home-country bias may be comfortable, but at a time like this one begins to see its drawbacks. Going global isn’t without its risks, of course. Currency risk. Taxation risk. Political risk. Volatility risk. So plunging headlong into foreign shares isn’t for the faint-hearted. But going forward, I expect many more investors to start taking an interest in overseas shares — dabbling in them first, perhaps, by taking a look at global investment trusts such as Aberdeen Asian Income, JP Morgan European Income, Henderson Far East Income, Schroder Oriental Income, and Murray International. ‘You can be sure of Shell,’ was the saying, back when I was growing up. Not any more, you can’t.

In mid-February, investment firm Janus Henderson published its usual quarterly global dividend review.

2020, judged the firm, looked set to deliver a fifth consecutive year of record dividends, with global payouts totalling of $1.48 trillion expected, some 3.9% higher than 2019.

But that was then; this is now.

Three months on, the more sober assessment of 2020 contained in the firm’s latest global dividend review is a great deal more downbeat. Its best case scenario sees a decline in global dividends of 15% this year to $1.21 trillion, a drop of $213bn. Its worst case scenario sees a decline of 35%, $933bn.

In hindsight, it’s easy to be critical. For a review published in mid-February to contain not a single mention of the words ‘coronavirus’, ‘Covid-19’, or ‘pandemic’ seems in retrospect a little shortsighted.

But hey, plenty of other people have also been wrong about Covid-19. Most of us, in fact, one way or another.

Global perspective If you’re not familiar with the quarterly Janus Henderson reviews, they’re worth checking out.

Basically, they take a country-by-country, region-by-region bottom-up focus to dividend projection, looking at business conditions, trade, economic growth and other factors bearing on corporate earnings.

So while they’re similar in many ways to the familiar re-branded Capita UK-only forecasts that are now published under the name of Link Asset Services, they’re a little more forward-looking.

Usefully, they also contain the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index. Standing at 196.3 at the end of March, this highlights that global dividends have almost doubled since 2009, when the index began.

How I’d invest £20k in this stock market crash to retire early

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BARC -0.62% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio FTMC -0.21% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

The 2020 stock market crash has unlocked some incredible opportunities for investors. Buying undervalued equities in a Stocks and Shares ISA or SIPP offers some of the best opportunities to get rich and retire early.

That is, if you’re willing to buy sound businesses cheaply and wait until their true value is realised. This requires foresight and not a little patience.

But choose wisely and hold fast, and I believe you can sit back and watch as your portfolio value rises.

Undervalued Now could be the perfect time to invest in a diverse range of and stocks to take best advantage of value for money. Buying when share prices are relatively cheap could improve your chance to retire early.

It’s true that some shares have recovered a little from the late February stock market crash. However, there is still a significant disconnect between the true value of many quality FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies and their current share prices.

Vanguard investing giant John Neff has advised that picking underdogs was the best way to get rich and retire early. “It’s not always easy to do what’s not popular, but that’s where you make your money,” he says. “Buy stocks that look bad to less careful investors and hang on until their real value is recognised.”

Stock market crash value One of the reasons Neff’s investments beat the market is his decision to pick overlooked and undervalued stocks. A simple way we can emulate him and have a decent shot at retiring early is to look at shares with relatively low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. The FTSE 100 market average is 14.6, while the FTSE 250 is 13.

Stocks and shares with P/E ratios below this number are cheaper than average. If we then look at the quality of their sales and revenue to see how they might perform in future, we can discern whether they are undervalued.

Remember: at any time the market might significantly undervalue high-grade FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 shares. The stock market crash of 2020 has made this list longer than usual too. So our chance to retire early on our Stocks and Shares ISA or SIPP portfolio alone is greater now than at any recent point in history.

P/E, P/S = Profit To get started I would be looking at high-quality companies that are trading at low P/E ratios, combined with low P/S ratios — that’s the share price compared to sales. The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the investment is. Generally anything under 1 is considered undervalued.

These are the companies most like to to be able to trade strongly out of the stock market crash and into the future. And then, for the market to realise their true value, as John Neff reminds us.

In the FTSE 250, I think that’s companies like Drax (P/E 8.2, P/S 0.21) and Ferrexpo (P/E 6, P/S 0.86).

In the FTSE 100 I would be looking at the likes of Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (P/E 9, P/S 0.38) and Barclays (LON: ) (P/E 8, P/S 0.86). It’s certainly true that these share prices are cheaper than at any point in recent history.

The desire to retire early is common, but the route there is uncommonly hard. That is, unless you are willing to follow these time-tested investing principles, in my view.

Many investors may naturally be cautious about the prospect of buying UK shares after the recent market crash. After all, the global economic outlook is very uncertain at the present time. And a second decline in stock prices can’t be ruled out.

However, many stocks now appear to offer good value for money after their recent falls. Here are two such companies that, while facing substantial risks in the near term, could produce high returns in the long run.

As such, now could be the right time to buy them in an ISA to improve your prospects of making a million.

A turnaround opportunity for long-term investors? While many UK shares have declined since the start of the year, Shell’s (LSE: RDSB) share price performance in 2020 has been especially challenging. The oil and gas company’s shares have declined by 45% year-to-date, with its recent updates highlighting the difficulties faced by the sector.

They include asset impairments due to a fall in the forecast prices of oil and gas. Add in lower demand for energy as a result of a weak economic outlook.

Despite this, Shell (LON: ) appears to have the capacity to deliver improving financial performance over the long run. It has a relatively solid balance sheet that could allow it to invest in renewables. This may help to reposition the business in a period where the shift towards greener forms of energy is likely to continue.

The company also plans to become leaner and more efficient, according to its recent update. This could help to mitigate a weaker top line performance. It may also mean it’s able to offer improving total returns within a diverse portfolio of UK shares.

Solid performance relative to other UK shares? While the performance of many UK shares has improved over the last few months, Vodafone’s (LSE: VOD) 17% rise in the past three months is significantly ahead of many of its index peers. For example, the has risen by 8% over the same time period.

The company’s recent results appear to have boosted investor sentiment. They showed a rise in sales and profit. They also included news of continued progress in its digital transformation and further investment made in infrastructure. This suggests the business is performing relatively well despite a challenging global economic outlook.

Furthermore, Vodafone’s shares appear to offer good value for money. They have a dividend yield of over 6%, which suggests they include a wide margin of safety. With fewer UK shares offering attractive yields and improving financial performances, the stock could become increasingly popular among investors.

This could lead to impressive total returns that contribute to improving returns for your portfolio. They may even help you to make a million over the coming years.

LONDON (Reuters) - French energy company Total is seeking to sell its 25.7% stake in the Shearwater Elgin Area Line (SEAL) pipeline in the British North Sea, industry sources said.

The sale could raise about $200 million, one of the sources said.

Total has engaged in direct discussions with several interested parties in recent weeks, the sources said.

A spokesman for Total declined to comment.

The SEAL pipeline, operated by Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), transports natural as from the Shearwater and Elgin Franklin platforms to the Bacton Gas Terminal on the Norfolk coast.

The recent collapse in oil and gas prices due to the coronavirus epidemic and the uncertain outlook have led to a sharp slowdown in dealmaking in the energy sector.

But energy pipelines and infrastructure remain attractive assets for investors as they often guarantee steady returns over long periods of time.

Investing.com -- Crude oil prices ticked lower Tuesday amid concerns about the U.S. economy and its ability to ride out a second wave of Covid-19 across the south and west of the country.

However, the selling pressure wasn’t strong enough to force the benchmark U.S. futures contract meaningfully below the $40/barrel level, which appears to have become something of a psychological reference point, if not actually a real support levels deduced from technical analysis.

By 9:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), futures were down 0.8% at $40.31 a barrel, while the international benchmark contract was down 0.4% at $42.91 a barrel.

The main supportive factors for the market continue to be the tightening of supply thanks to the OPEC+ pact on output restraint, and the gradual recovery of global demand from lockdowns in the second-quarter.

A survey by S&P Global Platts published on Tuesday showed the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumping at its lowest in over 30 years, with Saudi Arabia pumping at only 7.58 million barrels a day, and Venezuela – languishing after years of misrule under President Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez- pumping as little as 280,000 barrels a day. The same survey showed Russia, the most important non-OPEC signatory to the current output deal, pumping only 8.5 million barrels a day.

The market was also still taking comfort from International Energy Agency head Fatih Birol’s comments on Monday, dismissing fears that the pandemic had hastened the day of ‘peak oil demand’.

""If oil demand goes back to 100 million b/d I would not be surprised. And under a strong recovery, I would not be surprised if it went higher than that,"" Birol was quoted by newswires as saying.

The IEA currently expects world oil demand to recover to pre-pandemic levels no earlier than 2022.

The counterweight to such messaging was a warning of large-scale asset impairments by Italian major Eni (DE: ), which joined Shell (LON: ) in revising down its long-term forecast for refining margins. Eni now sees long-term margins in the Mediterranean at around $5 a barrel, down by over half from only five years ago.

LONDON (Reuters) - A series of huge write-downs among energy majors triggered by lower assumptions for future oil prices ( ) has put a spotlight on the sector's scattered price outlooks.

On Monday, Eni announced a 3.5 billion euro ($3.95 billion) impairment on the value of its assets after revising down its long-term oil price outlook.

That followed Royal Dutch Shell's (L: ) $22 billion write-down last week and BP 's (L: ) $17.5 billion hit in June.

While break-even prices for new development projects typically lie below future oil price assumptions, these write-downs have raised questions about the risk of stranded assets in the oil and gas sector.

LONDON/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - BP (LON: ) has paid Reliance Industries $1 billion (792 million pounds) to set up a joint network of thousands of petrol stations across India to tap the country's rapidly growing energy demand.

BP will hold 49% and Reliance the remaining 51% in the new company called Jio-bp, which will expand Reliance's current 1,400 retail sites up to 5,500 over the next five years, the pair said in a statement on Thursday after announcing the venture last August.

Jio-bp will also expand from 30 to 45 airports and plans to increase its staff from 20,000 to 80,000 over five years.

The plan comes as billionaire Mukesh Ambani, the owner of Reliance, which operates the world's biggest refining complex in Jamnagar, is currently in talks with oil group Saudi Arabia's Aramco (SE: ) to sell a 20% stake in the oil to chemical conglomerate.

UK oil group BP, along with many industry peers are aiming to sharply increase their global customer base in the coming decades as part of their shift to low-carbon energy, aiming to supply fuels and power even as demand for oil is expected to decline.

Jio-bp aims to provide Indian consumers with advanced fuels with lower emissions, electric vehicle charging and other low carbon solutions over time, the statements said.

India ""is a country that will require more energy for its economic growth and, as it prospers, its needs for mobility and convenience will accelerate,"" BP CEO Bernard Looney said in a statement.

Shell (LON: ) and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) also both want to strengthen their presence in India.

Does a crashing Shell share price make it a buy?

SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LCO -0.11% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

2020 has been an ‘annus horribilis’ so far for the Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) share price. Oil prices have collapsed on the double-whammy of both supply and demand issues. First, Saudi Arabia and Russia locked horns over supply production levels. Then the demand for oil slumped as world economies have stalled in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

The Shell share price has correspondingly plummeted and, despite recovering since March, still sits 50% lower than its year high.

The Shell share price is quite literally over a barrel Shell has assumed that the average price of will be $35 for 2020, rising to a $60 average by 2023 for its earnings estimates. But I think this is a little optimistic given the price of oil has been well below this average for much of the last five years. Ultimately, the Shell share price is intrinsically tied to the price of oil, which it cannot influence.

This lower price of oil means Shell are writing-down up to $22bn in the value of its assets. The International Energy Agency said in June that global demand for oil is set to fall at the “fastest rate in history” this year. Despite predicting a rebound in 2021, itsays with fewer people flying, it will be at least 2022 until consumption return to 2019 levels.

If in doubt, cut costs With the Shell share price collapsing and earnings plummeting on the back of depressed oil prices, management has sensibly looked to cut costs. The highly prized dividend, not cut since World War II, was scaled back by two-thirds, and the rhetoric coming from Shell suggests there may not be a return to previous levels. However, we are still looking at a fairly decent prospective yield of 5.5% for new investors.

Shell is targeting a 20%-30% gearing range of debt to equity. Italso announced a plan to cut $3-4bn off operating costs over the next year. However, this may not be enough, and with growing impairment costs Shell might look to further asset sales to keep the books balanced. It seems the Shell share price may remain under pressure for some time to come.

The future will likely see a shift to renewables. Slashing the dividend, which previously cost $15bn each year to service, will free up funds to pivot to green energy longer-term. But this looks a very long way away right now and requires a profitable oil business to fund that change.

I say don’t be fooled by the trailing P/E ratio under eight. The forward 12 months P/E is over 20 and that is nearly double the 10-year average. Perhaps the Shell share price is not so dirt-cheap after all?

I say don’t be fooled by the trailing P/E ratio under eight. The forward 12 months P/E is over 20 and that is nearly double the 10-year average. Perhaps the Shell share price is not so dirt-cheap after all?

By Ron Bousso

LONDON (Reuters) - Two energy industry veterans plan to launch an investment fund focused on hydrogen this year as more and more governments include the niche fuel in their global warming battle plans.

Hydrogen has long-been touted as a potential clean fuel as it only emits water vapour but it has failed to gain traction, mainly because of historically high production, transportation and storage costs.

But with the European Union for one now looking to promote so-called green hydrogen to help reach net zero emissions, the sector is expected to attract hundreds of billions of dollars in investment in the coming decades.

The new fund, HydrogenOne Capital, is being launched by JJ Traynor, a former Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) executive, and Richard Hulf, who has worked at Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) and been an energy fund manager at Artemis.

""We've spoken to a lot of people in the market who are interested in the theme but find it very hard to get invested, so our idea is to get a very focused team to be dedicated to this,"" Traynor told Reuters.

The 250 million pound ($315 million) fund is due to be launched by the end of 2020, according to a presentation for investors seen by Reuters. The London-based fund would be the world's first hydrogen-dedicated investment fund, Traynor said.

Analysts at Barclays (LON: ) expect demand for hydrogen to grow eight-fold to 575 million tonnes per year by 2050 in a market worth more than $1 trillion.

Shares of hydrogen-focused companies such as Bloom Energy and Ceres Power have soared as interest in the sector grows and governments and large energy and industrial companies accelerate plans to invest in hydrogen.

Most of the hydrogen available today is dubbed ""grey"" as it is made from in a process that creates carbon emissions. It is also mainly used by polluting sectors such oil refining, steel and chemicals.

The new fund will prioritise investments in ""green"" hydrogen, which is produced by electrolysis using renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and hydro, according to the prospectus.

However, it will consider investments in grey and ""blue"" hydrogen - made using gas but capturing and storing carbon emissions - as economies make the transition to cleaner fuels.

While HydrogenOne Capital will buy shares in listed companies, Traynor said the best value would come from investing in specific projects and private assets.

""Clean hydrogen is gaining strong political and business momentum,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) said in a report this month. ""This is why we believe that the hydrogen value chain deserves serious focus after three false starts in the past 50 years.""

Since hitting a nine-year low in March, the has risen 24% in tandem with other global indices. The strong recovery of the index has prompted fears over a second major sell-off, but many shares are still trading far below average historic valuations. What’s more, there are plenty of quality stocks that I’d be happy to buy and hold at today’s prices. As such, choosing the best UK shares on the market today could massively boost your chances of making a million.

The best UK shares on the market Focusing on growth stocks is the best way to realise serious long-term gains, in my view. Companies whose shares have strong upside potential could deliver immense capital growth and significantly swell the size of your investment portfolio over time. Key characteristics to look out for in a good growth stock include strong historical earnings growth, a good return on equity and promising forward earnings growth.

Companies such as Homeserve (LON: ), Just Eat (LON: ) and Games Workshop immediately spring to my mind. Each has a track record of earnings growth over recent years and doesn’t look to be slowing down any time soon. On top of this, all three have had a relatively profitable period in the midst of the global pandemic. Albeit not a guarantee of future success, it’s certainly testament to the resilience of the underlying businesses.

You won’t need me to tell you that the last few months have been a rough time for income investors. Dividends have been slashed left, right and centre. In fact, around half of the companies listed in the FTSE 100 have either cut or suspended payouts. Nevertheless, I’d still invest in the best UK shares that boast bulky yields to build serious wealth over time. Why? Well, it’s important to remember that dividends won’t stay suspended forever and as the economy continues to recover, they could be back sooner than many expect.

In my eyes, some of the best UK dividend shares include the oil titans Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and BP (LON: ). Despite being hammered by the coronavirus pandemic and the oil price war, I think the shares have huge recovery potential. Considering long-term opportunities in renewable energy, I reckon both are here to stay. Alternatively, pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, whose yield currently stands at 4.9%, could be a safer long-term play.

Make a million from the stock market crash Once you’ve invested in a handful of the best UK shares available on the market, the next part is easy. Hold for the long term. Doing so will allow you to ride out any temporary market downswings and ultimately, greatly increase your chances of making a million through compounding returns.

To illustrate, let’s say you invested £500 a month into a diversified selection of top UK shares. Assuming an annual return of 9%, you’d have a portfolio worth £1,031,550m after 32 years.

Ultimately, buying the best UK shares and holding them for the long term is a tried and tested method of building serious capital. It could even lead to you achieving a seven-figure portfolio. So what are you waiting for?

National Grid’s share price has fallen 10%+ this month. Should I buy the stock for its big dividend {{0|now}}?

National Grid (LSE: LON: ) shares have experienced a pullback this month. In the space of just over a week, National Grid’s share price has fallen from near 1,000p to 866p.

After that pullback, National Grid shares now sport a dividend yield of 5.6%. That’s certainly attractive in the current low-interest-rate environment. Should I buy the stock now to pick up that high yield? Let’s take a look at the investment case.

National Grid shares: a reliable dividend investment In the current environment, in which economic uncertainty is elevated, I can definitely see some appeal in owning a stock like National Grid.

Utilities is a very defensive sector. No matter what the economy is doing, we still need essential services such as electricity and gas. Utility companies also often operate under the protection of government regulations, which adds further resilience. What this means is that utility companies are generally able to generate relatively steady profits and cash flows throughout the economic cycle. This translates to reliable dividends.

This year, National Grid certainly hasn’t disappointed on the dividend front. While many other companies, including the likes of Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), BT Group (LON: ), and Lloyds Bank, have suspended, cancelled, or trimmed their dividends, National Grid has lifted its payout. Recently, in its full-year results, the group announced a 2.6% increase in its dividend, to 48.57p per share, in line with its policy to increase the payout at least as much as RPI inflation. That’s an impressive achievement, given the economic environment.

National Grid: dividend analysis Taking a closer look at National Grid’s dividend, however, I do have some concerns. For a start, dividend coverage isn’t high. Last year, National Grid generated underlying earnings per share of 58.2p. This means the dividend coverage ratio (earnings per share divided by dividends per share) was just 1.2. That’s quite low. Ideally, I like to see a dividend coverage ratio of at least 1.7. The higher the ratio, the less chance of a dividend cut in the future.

Secondly, National Grid has a large amount of debt on its balance sheet. In its full-year results, the company said it had net debt of £28.6bn and was expecting this to increase by around £3bn this year. By contrast, total shareholders’ equity was £19.6bn. This amount of debt adds risk to the investment case.

Finally, I’ve some concerns about the level of growth here. Over the last three years, revenues have fallen by around 3%. That’s not ideal. Revenue growth drives dividend growth. On top of this, British energy regulator Ofgem has said it wants UK energy network operators to invest £25bn from 2021 to 2026 to deliver emission-free energy. This could hit National’s Grid’s profits.

NG shares: my view Weighing everything up, I’m going to pass on National Grid shares for now. The dividend yield of 5.6% is, no doubt, attractive. However, all things considered, I think there are better dividend stocks to buy at the moment.

BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Investors who adopt a buy-and-hold strategy over the long-term could capitalise on the bargain stocks that are still on offer which could soon return to normal prices. One such stock I believe is Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB). Shell has stated that while it expects a crude price of $50 a barrel in 2022, its estimates of beyond that point remain the same at $60. Admittedly, considering the current economic climate and worries of a second wave, we could continue to see low demands for crude globally in the short-term. However, the best UK stocks to buy now, in my opinion, are centred around the necessity of the use of the product the company is providing, and I’m confident that the demand for oil and gas won’t disappear overnight.

Why Shell is one of the best UK stocks to buy now Additionally, it’s worth noting that Shell does a lot more than simply pump oil and gas out of the ground. It owns refineries, chemical plants, distribution networks, and is a world-class energy trader. I believe many of these engineering and infrastructure assets will remain relevant in an ever-changing future, especially if liquid petroleum gas or hydrogen becomes more widely used as transport fuels.

The Shell stock price has fallen drastically during this pandemic period, largely due to the bombing of oil prices in February. Shell followed BP (LON: ) and dropped its oil price forecasts for the next few years, leading to a £12bn-18bn reduction in its June quarter results, placing the share price at low levels of 1,250p at the time of writing.

One major opportunity arising out of the recent troubles with oil is that it may act as a catalyst to quicken efforts towards green energy. However, although the world needs to address climate change urgently, the reality is that billions of people all over the world still rely on fossil fuels through transportation, electricity, and the raw materials needed in manufacturing. Considering the dramatic fall in the share price and the necessary use of fossil fuels in people’s lives, it all adds further reason to why Shell may be one of the best UK stocks to buy now before it starts rallying once the pandemic starts to settle.

Dividend cut could help Shell shares Shell’s share price fell when the group cut its dividend by 65% in April. This was the first cut in dividends by the company since the Second World War. However, I am confident that it was the appropriate thing to do.

The annual £11bn dividend had become a burden that limited its ability to evolve. With this cut, Shell aims to strengthen its financial position and cut costs during a very difficult time. I believe shareholders will benefit from this decision over the longer term.

With the shares trading at around 1,250p and a personal optimistic outlook on the pandemic steadying in the coming months, I rate Shell as one of the best UK stock to buy now.

What market crash? Here are 2 FTSE 100 shares I believe may continue to be successful in July

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

What a volatile six months it has been in broader markets. Following the bull market of January and February, the coronavirus that initially affected China became a global pandemic. As countries went into lockdowns, panic hit the markets. Yet after the market lows in March, many shares had stellar run-ups in price.

Not every FTSE 100 stock has recovered fully, but there are several shares that are up considerably in 2020. It has now become a stock-pickers market. Those investors who concentrate on the new post-Covid-19 economy are likely to continue doing well in the second half of the year. Therefore, I’d like to discuss two FTSE 100 shares that are up in 2020. I believe they still deserve to be on your radar.

Highest market capitalisation in the FTSE 100 My first choice for today is pharma giant AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), whose shares are up 13% year-to-date (YTD). The group is now the UK’s biggest company by market capitalisation. It’s worth over £111bn. Before the market crash, oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) was heading the list. But the downturn has pushed the share price down by over 43% so far in the year. And the company is now number eight on the list. What a change of fortunes.

AZN shares have been buoyed in part by pharmaceutical companies’ relative safety amid the health and economic effects of the pandemic. Investors are also ready to pay a premium for its portfolio of drugs. That may be why the stock price has almost doubled in the past five years. In July 2016, it was around 4,280p. Now it is hovering at 8,460p.

The group concentrates on several major disease areas, including cancer, cardiovascular, diabetes, gastrointestinal, infection, inflammation and respiratory. A wide range of pharma companies are currently racing to develop a vaccine against Covid-19 and AZN is one of the forerunners. In mid-June the pharma giant announced that (assuming a vaccine works) it would “supply Europe with up to 400 million doses of Oxford University’s vaccine at no profit.”

As a result, the share price has been reacting extremely well. If AZN shares had been your only portfolio holding, you might not have thought that there has been a market crash in 2020. Shareholders also enjoy a current dividend yield of 2.65%.

Consumer rules The second stock I want to highlight is consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser (LSE: RB). This year, RB shares are up over 21%.

I expect the volatility in the markets to continue in the coming weeks. Another market crash could also happen. Therefore I’d make defensive stocks part of any long-term portfolio. Analysts regard consumer staples companies as defensive. People continue to buy household items, cleaning products, and other essentials such as personal hygiene products, even when their salaries are shrinking. And the potential second wave of the viral outbreak means everyone must pay more attention to basic hygiene than before.

On 30 April, the group also released Q1 results and reported record quarterly sales growth. The robust results were led by increased demand for many of its hygiene products, such as Dettol and Lysol, and health products like Mucinex, Nurofen, and VMS.

Reckitt Benckiser’s current dividend yield stands at 2.6%. The shares are expected to go ex-dividend in August. The FTSE 100 group feels to me like a must-have if you want a consumer-defensive company in your portfolio.

(Bloomberg) -- Crude oil is the world’s most important commodity, but it’s worthless without a refinery turning it into the products that people actually use: gasoline, diesel, jet-fuel and petrochemicals for plastics. And the world’s refining industry today is in pain like never before.

“Refining margins are absolutely catastrophic,” Patrick Pouyanne, the head of Europe’s top oil refining group Total SA (NYSE: ), told investors last month, echoing a widely held view among executives, traders and analysts.

What happens to the oil refining industry at this juncture will have ripple effects across the rest of the energy industry. The multi-billion-dollar plants employ thousands of people and a wave of closures and bankruptcies looms.

“We believe we are entering into an ‘age of consolidation’ for the reﬁning industry,” said Nikhil Bhandari, refining analyst at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) Inc. The top names of the industry, which collectively processed well over $2 trillion worth of oil last year, are giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc. There are also Asian behemoths like Sinopec (NYSE: ) of China and Indian Oil Corp., as well as large independents like Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE: ). and Valero Energy Corp (NYSE: ). with their ubiquitous fuel stations.

The problem for the refiners is that what’s killing them is the medicine that’s saving the wider petroleum industry.

When U.S. President Donald Trump engineered record oil production cuts between Saudi Arabia, Russia and the rest of the OPEC+ alliance in April, he may have saved the U.S. shale industry in Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota, but he squeezed refiners.

A refinery’s economics are ultimately simple: it thrives on the price difference between and fuels like gasoline, earning a profit that’s known in the industry as a cracking margin.

The cuts that Trump brokered lifted crude prices, with benchmark soaring from $16 to $42 a barrel in the space of a few months. But with demand still in the doldrums, gasoline and other refined products prices haven’t recovered as strongly, hurting the refiners.

The industry’s most rudimentary measure of refining profit, known as a 3-2-1 crack spread (it assumes three barrels of crude makes two of gasoline and one of diesel-like fuels), has slumped to its lowest level for the time of the year since 2010. Summer is normally a good period for refiners because demand rises with consumers hitting the road for their vacations. This time, however, some plants are actually losing money when they process a barrel of crude.

Worst Fear

Just a few weeks ago, the outlook appeared to be improving for the world’s biggest oil consumers. Demand in China was almost back to pre-virus levels and U.S. consumption was gradually rebounding. Now, a second wave of infections has prompted Beijing to lock down hundreds of thousands of residents. Covid-19 cases are also on the rise in Latin America and elsewhere.

With demand in the U.S. now showing signs of heading south again as coronavirus cases flare up in top gasoline-consuming regions including Texas, Florida and California, the margins are at risk of deteriorating in America, which accounts for nearly two in each ten barrels of oil refined worldwide.

“The worst fear for refiners is a resurgence of the virus and another series of lockdowns around the world that would again significantly impact demand,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.

Another problem is that -- where it has been recovering -- the demand pickup has been uneven from one refined product to the next, creating significant headaches for executives who need to select the best crudes to purchase, and the right fuels to churn out. Gasoline and diesel consumption has surged back, in some cases to 90% of their normal level, but jet-fuel remains nearly as depressed as at the nadir of the coronavirus lockdowns, running at just 10% to 20% of normal in some European countries.

Refiners had resolved the problem by blending much of their jet-fuel output into, effectively, diesel. But that, in turn, is creating a new challenge: too much of so-called middle distillates like diesel and .

“Right now gasoline demand is barely keeping some plants alive,” said Stephen Wolfe, head of crude oil at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. “And with jet production shifting over to diesel and gasoline production, that puts even more strain on product supply,” he added.

In the U.S. refining belt, processing rates are being continually tweaked in response to potential fluctuations in demand. In April, during the height of U.S. lockdowns, Valero Energy Corp.’s McKee, Texas, refinery cut rates to about 70%. It then raised processing to near 79% in anticipation of the Memorial Day holiday, before finding a new low of 62% by mid June, according to people familiar with the situation.

Ultimately, if refiners don’t make money, they buy less crude, potentially capping the oil-price recovery of the past few months for Brent and other benchmarks. Even so, the actions of Saudi Arabia, Russia and the rest of the OPEC+ group suggest that refiners will remain squeezed for longer, with oil prices outpacing the recovery in fuel prices.

The immediate problem is compounded by a longer-term trend: the industry has probably overbuilt over the last decades, and older plants in places like Europe and the U.S. can’t compete with new ones popping up in China and elsewhere in the world.

“Refinery margins in the next five years are going to be worse than the average for the last five years, and particularly bad in Europe,” said Spencer Welch, vice president of oil markets and downstream consulting at IHS Markit. “We already thought that refining was in for a tough time, even more so now.”

Catalyst for Change

The weakness means that the industry’s collective earnings will plunge to just $40 billion this year, down from $130 billion in 2018, according to an estimate from industry consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. of 550 refineries around the world.

That could be a catalyst for change. The demand hit from the virus is yet to cause any delays in a number of mega-refining projects, most of which are in China and the Middle East, that will start operations from 2021 to 2024, according to the analysts at Goldman Sachs. This will cause global utilization rates to be 3% lower over this period than in 2019. Plants are more likely to close in developed countries because the bulk of demand -- and new refining capacity -- is in developing nations, they said.

Many of the refineries that are being built in the Middle East and China will also get government backing, a fact that only makes life more challenging for the plants in Europe and the U.S.

The industry is already moving to resolve the overcapacity: oil trader Gunvor Group Ltd. has said it may mothball its refinery in Antwerp, and U.S. refining group HollyFrontier Corp. in June announced it was changing its Cheyenne plant from processing crude oil into a renewable diesel facility.

For now though, there’s a more mundane reality to deal with: the market. OPEC and its allies can constrain the supply of crude -- squeezing refiners -- but they can’t make end users consume fuel.

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's top oil and gas companies locked in cheap borrowing rates to raise a record amount of debt in the second quarter of 2020 and boost cash reserves as a buffer against a collapse in revenues because of COVID-19.

The dash for debt piles pressure on company balance sheets and the issue is particularly acute for BP (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ). Already burdened by high levels of borrowing, they also face the disruption of a major shift towards renewables and low-carbon.

The world's top seven energy firms - BP, Shell, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), Chevron (NYSE: ), Equinor, Total and Eni - raised $60 billion in debt in the quarter, nearly half of the $132 billion in oil and gas sector borrowing over the period, Refinitiv data showed.

BP, which had $78.5 billion in debt by the end of March, raised the most at nearly $16 billion, using for the first time hybrid bonds that place less strain on the balance sheet as the principal is not required to be repaid. (Graphic: The great debt rush, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/oakpeajrkpr/eikon.png)

Oil majors' revenues are expected to drop sharply in the second quarter after movement restrictions to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 led to a steep drop in fuel consumption.

Benchmark averaged below $30 a barrel in the second quarter when it hit the lowest in two decades.

Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, is expected to report a second consecutive quarterly loss, while Shell said its fuel sales in the second quarter fell by around 40%.

COVID RECOVERY?

The coronavirus crisis has battered oil company shares, which underperformed the broader indexes, as concerns over their ability to withstand the short-term shock added to uncertainty linked to the world's shift to renewable power.

The share price drop dealt a double blow to the companies as the ratio of their debt to total market size, known as gearing and an indicator of financial health, is set to rise.

Higher gearing can impact a company's credit ratings and increase its cost of borrowing.

Jason Kenney, analyst at Santander (MC: ), said oil majors were likely to see debt levels spike in 2020.

""This is not necessarily all bad given the current low interest rates and the chance to increase liquidity cheaply,"" Kenney said.

""That said, gearing and leverage levels will likely move out of target ranges before moving back to more usual levels over the coming years."" (Graphic: Big Oil's rising debt IMG, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/jbyprrbolpe/eikon.png)

The debt crisis coincides with Shell and BP's plans to shift from fossil fuels in the coming decades, details of which they are expected to unveil later this year.

BP acted to reduce its debts with the $5 billion sale of its petrochemical business in late June, helping it reach its $15 billion asset disposal target.

But the strain on its balance sheet could lead its CEO Bernard Looney to cut the company's dividend when it reports its second quarter results on Aug. 4.

Redburn analyst Stuart Joyner said he expects BP to reduce its dividend by 33%.

Although the debt levels of BP and its rivals are set to rise, the companies do not face severe distress with current oil prices of above $40 a barrel, Joyner said.

Cheap shares: I think these FTSE 350 shares have huge recovery potential

The stock market crash back in March is still creating opportunities for investors looking for a bargain. I think these shares all have huge recovery potential as the prices have fallen heavily.

The cheap travel stock National Express (LSE: NEX) shares are down over 60% so far this year. Like other travel-focused shares, it’s been understandably hit hard by the lockdown. The shares had been steadily rising though for years before the coronavirus outbreak.

National Express was able to update back in May that even though revenue halved in April its earnings and cash flow were better than expected. Services are also opening up across the UK, US, Spain, and Morocco this month.

With operating profits increasing from £197.9m to £242.3m between 2017 and 2019, I think it’s a hugely profitable company. Revenues also increased by 18% over the same time period.

My main concern is that the group does carry about £1.2bn of net debt at the time of its last annual report. Also the biggest division is school buses in North America so much of the recovery will be dependent on schools reopening there.

On a price-to-earnings of only five I think the shares could well be too cheap to ignore.

The builder with huge recovery potential Crest Nicholson (LSE: LON: ) are, based on the P/E ratio, just as cheap as those of National Express. Like other housebuilders, it seems to be suffering from a lack of investor enthusiasm for the industry as a whole. This is likely because investors anticipate Brexit negotiations and the end of Help to Buy in coming years might hamper demand.

More recently, the coronavirus has obviously had an effect as well, pushing the cheap share price pre-virus even lower.

The group no longer pays a dividend. It also said it now expects FY2020 adjusted profit before tax to be in the range of £35m to £45m, which is well below 2019’s profit of £121.1m. Its debt is also now a bit of a worry and is worth keeping an eye on.

For all this though I think the share has the potential to recover. Housebuilders were allowed to reopen much earlier other than many other industries. They benefit from the UK’s continuing imbalance between supply and demand for housing.

The dividend cutter Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) has been hammered because the company took the step of cutting its dividend. Along with worries over the oil price and fears about the global economy there’s been a bit of a perfect storm brewing over the share price.

Add to the mix comment from rival BP’s CEO saying now could be “peak oil” and it’s little wonder investor confidence in Shell isn’t so high.

Yet for all this in the short-term, given how cheap the shares are I think there’s the opportunity for a huge recovery. Confidence fluctuates and Shell has come through similar periods before. Longer term, it also has opportunities in clean energy and petrochemicals so its days are far from over in my view.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian energy group Eni said it would write off around 3.5 billion euros ($4 billion) from the value of its assets after revising down its long-term outlook for oil and gas prices due to economic fallout from the COVID-19 crisis.

In a statement on Monday, Eni (MI: ) said it was cutting its 2023 long-term price assumption for to $60 a barrel from a previous $70 and gas on the Italian hub to $5.5/million British thermal units from $7.8.

""Our changed long-term assumptions, reached four months after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, reflect our current expectations about future prices and will be incorporated in our processes of capital allocation,"" Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said.

The move follows similar writedowns by rivals such as BP (L: ) and Shell (L: ) as crumbling demand due to the COVID-19 crisis and the transition to lower-carbon energy trigger a recalculation of reserves and asset values.

Eni said it expected ""post-tax impairment charges against non-current assets, including a devaluation of tax credits recorded in connection with tax-losses carryforwards, of 3.5 billion euros, plus/minus 20%"".

It said it would book the writedowns, most of them on upstream assets, in its second-quarter results.

It said it now forecast Brent at $40, $48 and $55 per barrel in the period 2020-2022, respectively, from a previous $45, $55 and $70 per barrel.

Earlier this year Eni pledged to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% in one of the most ambitious clean-up drives in an industry under pressure from investors to go green.

Descalzi confirmed the group's strategy to become a leader in the decarbonization process despite the enduring impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and the group.

Another day, more volatility. But I’m not referring to the choppiness in broader equity markets. Instead, I’m thinking of the wild price swings in cryptocurrencies, such as . Market participants highlight that in the cryptocurrency world, prices rise fast and fortunes are created seemingly overnight. But there is always the other side of the coin (no pun intended), where crashes are sudden and severe.

That’s why I think average retail investors who plan long-term for comfortable retirements will be better off investing in stable and companies, rather than buying into Bitcoin for an adrenaline rush.

Where the Bitcoin price is now If you are following the price of Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, you may agree with me when I say uncertainty is the only constant.

For example, in 2017, the price soared from under $1,000 to nearly $20,000. But it then fell below $7,000. By November 2018, it was below $4,000. Then in June 2019, Bitcoin was over $10,000.

But in early January 2020, Bitcoin was back around $7,000. As broader stock markets began falling in February, Bitcoin hovered around $9,000. By mid-March, it dropped to the $5,000 level. On 3 July, as I write, it is hovering at $9,100.

Despite the increase in prices in recent years, there are simply not enough merchants using cryptocurrencies yet. In 2019, about $4 billion in bitcoin transactions was sent through payment processors. On the other hand, according to Nilson Report, “Purchase transactions on global general purpose card brands totaled 440.99 billion in 2019, up 19.4% over the previous year“.

So wild price swings and high speculation are combined with a lack of global transaction demand. Clearly, investing hard-earned cash (that you want to grow for retirement years) in Bitcoin is not for everyone.

Blockchain technology is important But there’s a way to have the best of both worlds through buying blockchain-relevant shares. Cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, which can be described as a digital ledger, acting as a spreadsheet.

In the future, blockchain applications are likely to impact agriculture, asset management, insurance, healthcare, retail, and supply chain management, to name a few areas.

For retail investors, companies that work with blockchain technology may be appropriate businesses to do due diligence on. Their shares may potentially be worthy additions to long-term portfolios.

Which FTSE companies would I consider? Several big pharma giants, such as AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, have collaborated to promote and cut the cost of drug discovery through increased use of blockchains.

Grocery stores and food manufacturers, such as Sainsbury‘s and Unilever (LON: ), are looking at how blockchain could help them keep track of food in the supply chain.

Energy giants, including BP (LON: ), Centrica (LON: ), and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), are exploring how blockchain technology can be used in the energy sector.

Some global banks, including HSBC Holdings (LON: ), Lloyds, and Santander (MC: ), are researching the potential use of blockchain-based banking solutions.

Investing in FTSE 100 shares In the coming years, I expect many FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies to embrace ‘blockchain’ technology. And I’d rather invest in these established global companies with robust businesses and stable cash flows. A good number of them also pay juicy dividends.

My Motley Fool colleagues regularly cover shares and funds that you could consider adding to a diversified retirement portfolio. They point out that despite various downturns and even crashes, in the long run, stock markets in the UK return about 6% to 8% annually, on average.

Earning a passive income is a fantastic way to earn money without much stress or effort. Achieving it can mean financial stability and freedom, allowing you to spend more time doing the things you love. Developing a passive income stream is easier said than done. But I think growing one from stock market dividends is about as straightforward as it gets. Here’s why.

A passive income from UK dividend shares When it comes to earning an income through investing in the stock market, dividends are the key. These are the distribution of a portion of a company’s profits to shareholders. Some companies pay a much larger dividend than others, and some don’t pay one at all. In fact, it’s not uncommon to find newly established companies that are seeking to expand operations reinvesting the majority of their earnings, rather than paying out a dividend.

For other companies, the dividend payment is perhaps one of the principal reasons why investors buy the shares in the first place. Think about companies such as Shell (LON: ), BP (LON: ) and British American Tobacco (LON: ). All three aren’t going to grow exponentially over the coming years, but they each offer a bulky dividend yield that’s attractive to income investors.

However, when investing in dividend stocks, it’s important to consider factors other than the yield. Features that are equally significant include a history of dividend growth and a sustainable payout ratio. A good combination of these factors in a stock will ensure a healthy passive income stream.

Is it possible to live off dividends? The possibility of living off dividends may seem like a pipe dream given the uncertain economic outlook and stock market volatility. After all, around half of the companies listed in the have cancelled or cut dividends. Even Shell, the world’s biggest dividend payer in five out of the last seven years, succumbed to the pressure.

Nevertheless, if you have a long-term investment horizon, I don’t think there’s anything to worry about. Many of the companies that have slashed dividends will eventually resume payouts, provided the businesses can recover in line with the economy. As such, setting yourself up today in the best way possible to earn a bumper passive income stream is a wise idea.

It’s important to note that the process of living off dividends is a marathon. Not a sprint. A sizeable passive income stream from your dividends won’t come overnight (unless you have a huge lump sum ready to invest). With that in mind, I recommend targeting dividend growth stocks. These companies increase their dividend annually, which means that your income rises without you having to do a single thing.

Given enough time in the market, earning a tidy income from your investments and using it to live on is entirely feasible. By focusing your efforts on the key characteristics to look out for, it should be straightforward to determine the best UK dividends shares that will fuel your passive income venture.

(Bloomberg) --

ENI (MI: ) SpA (NYSE: ) became the latest oil company to cut its long-term price assumptions, saying the coronavirus pandemic would have a lasting impact on the industry.

Eni now sees benchmark at $60 a barrel in 2023 real terms, down from a previous estimate of $70, the company said late Monday, warning of impairment charges. Rivals Royal Dutch Shell Plc (LON: ) and BP Plc (NYSE: ) have also cut price forecasts as the lockdown-induced slump batters their business, forcing producers to reassess the value of their assets amid a shift to cleaner energy.

“Having considered the prospect of the pandemic having an enduring impact on the global economy and the energy scenario, Eni has revised its view of market fundamentals,” the Rome-based producer said in a statement. The company said it would stick to -- or even speed up -- its long-term climate strategy presented in February.

The spread of the coronavirus across the world this year wiped out fuel demand, hitting oil majors’ earnings in the first quarter and threatening worse to come in the second. Despite a recent rebound in consumption in some of the worst-hit countries, resurgent waves of the virus show the recovery remains fragile.

Lowering price forecasts “appears to be the flavor of the month,” Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Europe, said in a note. At Eni, “we do not see its current dividend as compatible with its aggressive decarbonization strategy.”

Last month, BP signaled it would make the biggest writedown on the value of its business since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, as it cut estimates for oil and gas prices in the coming decades between 20% and 30%. Two weeks later, Shell also said it had revised its mid- and long-term pricing outlook, and warned of a record writedown.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) is not ruling out moving its headquarters from the Netherlands to Britain, the oil company's chief executive Ben van Beurden said in a Dutch newspaper interview published on Saturday.

Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever (L: ) (AS: ) said last month it plans to ditch its dual Anglo-Dutch legal structure and create a single entity in Britain.

Van Beurden did not explicitly say Shell wants to move its headquarters, het Financieele Dagblad said.

""You always need to keep thinking,"" Shell's Van Beurden told the newspaper. ""Nothing is permanent and of course we will look at the business climate. But moving your headquarters is not a trivial measure. You cannot think too lightly about that.""

A Shell spokesman confirmed the CEO's comments to Reuters and said the company was looking at ways to simplify its dual structure, as it had been doing for many years.

Shell has a complex Anglo-Dutch holding structure with a tax residency and headquarters in the Netherlands and a registered office in Britain.

Unilever's decision to move followed the scrapping in 2018 of a plan by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte to do away with a 15% dividend withholding tax.

Shell’s corporate structure features the parent company headquarters in The Hague but two share classes and other arrangements to prevent the Dutch government from levying withholding tax on dividends paid to shareholders of its former British arm.

(Reuters) - UK stocks ended lower on Friday, with the FTSE 100 index wiping out gains for the week as a record surge in U.S. COVID-19 cases made investors question the chance of a swift global economic recovery.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 ( ) slid 1.3%, with BP Plc (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) among the biggest drags, as the new infections raised the spectre of further lockdowns and hit oil prices.

UK stock markets have rebounded sharply from a virus-driven crash in March, helped by historic stimulus and, more recently, data that had raised hopes that the worst of the pandemic's economic damage might be over.

By Matthew Green, Valerie Volcovici and Emma Farge

LONDON/WASHINGTON/GENEVA (Reuters) - Climate change may be having its day in court.

With the slow pace of international climate negotiations, lawyers from Switzerland to San Francisco are increasingly filing lawsuits demanding action.

And they are getting creative -- using new legal arguments to challenge companies and governments before a judge.

Two decades ago, only a handful of climate-related lawsuits had ever been filed worldwide. Today, that number is 1,600, including 1,200 lawsuits in the United States alone, according to data reported Friday by the London School of Economics.

""The courts are an increasingly important place for addressing the problem of climate change,"" said Hari Osofsky, the dean of Penn State Law and the School of International Affairs.

Already, climate campaigners are seeing glimmers of success.

In the Netherlands in December, the country's Supreme Court upheld a ruling in favour of the Urgenda campaign group's demand that the Dutch government move faster to cut carbon emissions.

And in January, a judge in Switzerland acquitted a dozen climate protesters from trespassing charges, filed after the group staged a tennis match within a branch of Credit Suisse (SIX: ) in 2018 to draw attention to the bank's fossil fuel loans. Defence lawyers had argued that the protesters' actions were necessitated by the ""imminent danger"" posed by climate change. The ruling was met in court with a standing ovation.

""It was an exceptional ruling,"" one of the defence lawyers, Aline Bonard, told Reuters. Given that the protesters admitted to trespassing, ""the infraction is undeniable.""

But cases like these suggest a shift in how people are understanding the role of the judiciary in mediating cases related to the warming climate. Now, ""there is bound to be a new wave of legal proceedings using a similar line of argument,"" Bonard said.

NEW LEGAL TACTICS

As rulings that compel governments to cut emissions remain rare, lawyers still see promise in targeting large, polluting companies. Such cases in the past tended to accuse coal-fired power stations or government of failing to limit emissions. Cases now are being fought on arguments such as consumer protections and human rights.

This shift been especially pronounced in the United States, where more than a dozen cases filed by states, cities and other parties are challenging the fossil fuel industry for its role in causing climate change and not informing the public of its harms. (Reuters Insight: https://reut.rs/31QUB6b)

Last month, both Minnesota state and the District of Columbia filed lawsuits alleging that oil majors had misled consumers on how using their products involved releasing carbon emissions and contributing to climate change.

Those cases followed another filed in October by Massachusetts, which also used consumer protection arguments in suing Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ). All three accused the oil companies of engaging in deceptive practices and false advertising.

""As awareness of climate change grew in the general public to the extent that their disinformation campaigns were no longer acceptable, there was a pivot to greenwashing,"" Kate Konopka, Washington D.C.'s deputy attorney general, told Reuters.

In each case, most of the companies denied the allegations. BP Plc (L: ) declined to comment.

Exxon said the Washington D.C. lawsuit was part of a ""coordinated, politically motivated"" campaign against energy companies and was without merit. Chevron Corp (N: ) also dismissed the D.C. case, saying the litigation ""distracts"" from its efforts to address climate change.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) said it was ""committed to playing our part"" in addressing climate change, but that lawsuits ""impede the collaboration needed for meaningful change.""

But companies appear to be worried. The National Association of Manufacturers formed a group in 2017 to push back against ""activist lawyers"" for trying to scapegoat energy manufacturers.

The group, called the Manufacturers' Accountability Project, applauded a December ruling in New York clearing Exxon Mobil of securities fraud charges, after it was accused of failing to inform investors about what it knew about climate change.

""Courts are rejecting this misguided and misleading narrative, with a federal judge already calling them 'hyperbolic' last year when New York's attorney general brought claims based on essentially the same allegations,"" said Phil Goldberg, a lawyer representing the group.

PRESSURE CAMPAIGN

On the human rights front, there were only five lawsuits using these arguments before 2015. Since then, there have been 40 more, said LSE report co-author Joana Setzer, an assistant professor at the London School of Economics's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.

Not all of these new tactics have worked out, though.

In a high-profile decision in January, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco dismissed ""Juliana v. United States,"" in which 21 youths had accused the federal government of infringing on their rights to life and liberty by perpetuating an economic system fuelling dangerous climate change. Judge Andrew Hurwitz said he had ""reluctantly"" concluded that the issue was a matter for the executive and legislative branches.

Whether or not a judge rules in favour of climate interests, legal experts say the momentum of having so many cases before courts is serving to underline the urgency of the climate issue for both the public and policymakers.

""We need massive government intervention to get us out of the hole that we're in, which makes government a primary target,"" said Tim Crosland, director of British climate litigation charity Plan B.

The group was part of a campaign that successfully sued to block a third runway at London's Heathrow Airport, with Britain's Court of Appeal agreeing in February that the plan had failed to consider the country's commitments under the 2015 Paris climate accord. That decision is now awaiting a final appeal.

Richard Wiles, executive director of the D.C.-based Center for Climate Integrity, a non-profit organisation supporting climate litigation, said the tumble of climate cases would work toward weakening the lobbying power of the fossil fuel industry.

""Just as you wouldn't expect tobacco companies to be at the table when we're deciding pubic heath policy, the notion that the oil industry would dictate climate policy doesn't hold water,"" Wiles said. ""They are just not going to have the same ability to dictate climate policy that they did in the past.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/climate-battles-are-moving-into-the-courtroom-and-lawyers-are-getting-creative-2154666,0.111,0.794,0.095,-0.9625

OSLO (Reuters) - Global oil demand and carbon dioxide emissions probably peaked in 2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic will have a lasting impact on both, energy consultancy DNV GL said on Wednesday.

The Norway-based consultancy, which advises both petroleum and renewable energy companies on risk management and technology, said global energy use would be 8% lower in 2050 than previously expected due to the impact of the pandemic.

""Lasting behavioural changes to travel, commuting and working habits will also decrease energy usage and lessen demand for fossil fuels from the transport sector as well as from iron and steel production,"" DNV GL said in a statement about its research on the impact of the pandemic on oil demand and emissions.

""While we expect oil demand to recover next year, we think that it's likely that it will never reach the levels seen in 2019,"" Sverre Alvik, head of DNV GL's Energy Transition Outlook, told Reuters.

The International Energy Agency said on June 16, it did not expect oil demand to return to pre-pandemic levels before 2022 due to a slump in air travel.

DNV GL has previously predicted oil demand would plateau in 2022.

Growing scepticism about long-term global oil demand in a post-pandemic world is putting pressure on oil companies to revalue their assets.

Shell (L: ) said on Tuesday it would write off assets worth up to $22 billion after the coronavirus crisis knocked oil and gas demand and weakened the outlook for energy prices.

Renewable energy is seen benefiting from the crisis, because when total energy demand falls, the cheapest sources, such as wind and solar, are preferred to fossil fuels, Alvik said.

While global CO2 emissions also likely peaked in 2019, the expected decline in future would not be steep enough to meet the Paris climate agreement goals, so other measures such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and greater use of hydrogen were needed, DNV GL said.

""COVID-19 has shown that behavioural changes are indeed possible, and we can use this opportunity to make a change which is good for (the) climate,"" Alvik said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/global-oil-demand-co2-emissions-likely-peaked-in-2019--energy-consultancy-2152885,0.081,0.794,0.125,0.9618

SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio FERG +2.05% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Now more than ever it’s time to plan for the future. The uncertainty that Covid-19 has thrown up has made most people revisit their finances. But the dream of retiring early (and having enough money to fund this) doesn’t have to be thrown in the bin. There are still some great opportunities within the stock market to generate enough profit to aid early retirement. And by adding the stock you buy to an ISA, you can further enhance its potential.

The benefit of putting stocks you like into a Stocks and Shares ISA is that you don’t have to pay capital gains tax when you sell the stock for a profit. The capital gains tax rate varies depending on your income, but would usually be somewhere between 10% and 20%. This is significant enough to hamper plans to retire early, especially if the stocks you hold perform very well. So using this Government-approved wrapper to remove the need to pay the tax makes sense for investors.

One stock I’d buy Ferguson (LSE: FERG) is a large plumbing and heating group. It mainly operates in the UK under the Wolseley (LON: ) brand, with over 500 stores. The share price has been performing well recently and is almost back to pre-crash levels. I think this reflects the confidence that investors have with buying the brand at the moment. It operates in a defensive sector, that of consumer staple products.

Trade supplies will always be needed, regardless of the state of the economy. This means that financial results for this year are unlikely to be hampered significantly. This was highlighted with revenue growing by 0.9% year on year in the three months to April 30.

It’s true that the UK only accounts for about 10% of group revenues. Yet the inelasticity of demand for trade supplies remains, wherever in the world it’s being sold.

One stock I’d avoid At the moment, I’d be staying away from Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSA). Back in April, the firm cut the dividend payout by 66%, in order to help ease cash flow and retain funds for operations. This likely discouraged income investors from buying the stock, as it hadn’t cut dividends since the Second World War.

More recent news has shown that the firm is likely to cut £18bn from the value of its oil and gas assets. This is in large part due to the slump in oil prices seen recently. This is taken on as impairments, so it’s not an actual cash loss, but is still concerning. The reduction in value links to the level at which the firm is forecasting oil will trade over the next couple of years. It has downgraded the forecast, which inevitably will have a knock-on impact on both asset values and future profitability.

The oil price slump can be argued to be a by-product of the pandemic, and so although I’d avoid Shell for now, it’s still a stock to keep an eye on for a potential buy further down the line.

So with one stock to buy now for the ISA, and another to keep an eye on, there’s plenty to get involved with. Making your money work harder now will increase the chances of being able to retire early. There’s no time to lose.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Brazil's Raízen, the world's largest sugar-making company, and Asian commodities trader Wilmar International (SI: ) are set to end their partnership in the global sugar trading joint venture RAW, four sources familiar with the process said.

The joint venture, formed in 2016, was the second-largest trader of Brazilian sugar, with volumes around 4 million tonnes annually, and its dissolution will make the market more fragmented.

Officials at Raízen wanted Wilmar to move RAW into shared investment opportunities, including expansion plans in Brazil, but Wilmar disagreed, so Raízen decided to dissolve the unit, according to one of the sources familiar with the matter. The sources asked not to be named, because they have business links to both companies.

Raízen said it would not comment. Wilmar did not return requests for comment.

When the venture was formed, it had the capability to trade all of Raízen's production of more than 3 million tonnes of very high polarization (VHP) sugar per year, plus 1.5 million tonnes that Wilmar sourced from other producers in Brazil.

The end of the joint venture will reduce consolidation in the global sugar trade. It makes Alvean, a joint venture between commodities giant Cargill ( ) and Brazilian sugar and ethanol merchant Copersucar, much larger than any competitor, with volumes nearing 10 million tonnes per year.

""It opens up the trading space a bit more because Wilmar will not be sourcing all their sugar from Raízen anymore,"" said a source at a Europe-based sugar trader.

Raízen, a 50-50 joint venture formed by Brazil's Cosan SA (SA: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ), is Brazil's top sugar and ethanol producer, as well as one of the three largest fuel distributors in the country.

Earlier this week, Raizen was the largest deliverer against the expiration of ICE (NYSE: )'s July raw sugar contract, with near 200,000 tonnes, while Wilmar was a receiver of part of that sugar, according to sources.

Traders wondered why both companies were using the exchange's system to move sugar when they had a joint trading venture.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusive-raizen-wilmar-set-to-end-sugar-trading-venture-raw--sources-2154480,0.008,0.968,0.025,0.5499

MILAN (Reuters) - Oil majors Eni (MI: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) were aware that most of the money they spent to buy a Nigerian oilfield in 2011 would go in corrupt payments to politicians and officials, an Italian prosecutor said on Thursday.

""They were kickbacks. And Eni and Shell knew it,"" Sergio Spadaro told judges in Milan, summing up the prosecutors' case in what is one of the industry's largest corruption scandals.

Italy's Eni and Shell, who deny any wrongdoing, acquired the OPL 245 offshore field in 2011 for about $1.3 billion from Malabu, a company owned by former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete.

Prosecutors allege that about $1.1 billion (883.96 million pounds) of that money was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen, half of it to Etete himself.

Shell says the 2011 agreement was a settlement of long-standing litigation, following the previous allocation of the block by the Nigerian government to Shell and Malabu.

During a seven-hour speech in a special court room to meet COVID-19 requirements, Spadaro read out a series of emails between former Shell managers, including one saying it had been taken for granted Etete would have only kept a part of the price for himself, using the rest to pay off Nigerian politicians.

""There are a whole load of sharks around,"" the email read out by Spadaro said.

Prosecutors are expected to make their final sentencing requests for those involved in the long-running case at a second hearing in Milan scheduled for July 21.

Besides the two companies, another 13 people are involved in the case including current Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi and former Shell head of upstream Malcolm Brinded.

All the defendants have denied any wrongdoing, saying the purchase price was paid into an official Nigerian government account with all subsequent transfers being beyond their control.

In a statement on Thursday, Eni said it had paid the Nigerian government a fair and reasonable price for the field in a clear and transparent way.

""Eni did not know, nor was obliged in any way to know, the final destination of the funds subsequently paid to Malabu by the Nigerian government,"" it said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/italian-prosecutor-says-eni-shell-aware-of-bribes-in-nigeria-case-2154865,0.039,0.924,0.036,-0.0772

Stock market crash bargains: is it worth buying BP shares at today’s price?

Oil supermajor BP (LSE: LON: ) has had a tough start to 2020. Investor sentiment towards the company took a turn for the worse in the early days of the stock market crash. As a result, BP’s share price plunged by 50% in the depths of the sell-off. Since then, the shares have risen in tandem with many stocks around the world. However, the company’s valuation is still down by 33% overall.

Business woes This can be attributed to several factors. Perhaps most importantly, the onset of the global pandemic and the subsequent collapse in oil demand. On top of this, the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia added fuel to the fire.

The plunging price of oil has hit the business hard. As a result, BP’s cash flows have turned sharply negative and the road to recovery seems long and arduous.

Consequently, the company has proceeded with some difficult decisions over recent weeks in an effort to preserve cash. For example, two weeks ago, the oil major announced it would be cutting around 10,000 jobs, which amounts to approximately 15% of its entire workforce.

On top of this, I wouldn’t be surprised if BP soon follows in the footsteps of Shell (LON: ) and cuts its dividend. Obviously, this would come as unwelcome news to income investors, but it would enable the company to save a huge amount of potentially vital cash.

What does the future hold for BP shares? It’s not all doom and gloom for BP though. A fortnight ago, the oil firm announced it was writing off up to $17.5bn after cutting long-term oil and gas price forecasts. The revised assumption comes in at around $55 per barrel for , which seems far more realistic to me than previous predictions of around $75. Unlike some, I see this as positive news for BP in that the business is gearing up to face weaker demand and lower prices over the long term.

What’s more, at the beginning of the week, BP agreed to sell its petrochemicals business to Ineos for $5bn. The move will bolster the company’s balance sheet and also work to deliver its $15bn disinvestment target a year early. In my view, the sale marks another positive step in the future direction of the business.

Additionally, BP recently forecast that the aftermath of the global pandemic would accelerate the transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system. Having already pumped heavy amounts of cash into renewables over recent years, I think BP is favourably positioned to capitalise on the inevitable transition.

Are they worth buying? As such, I see BP shares as a savvy long-term play. With the potential for attractive capital gains through share price appreciation and the eventual resumption of juicy dividend payments, I think it’s worth buying BP shares at today’s price.

After a 14% plunge in early June, BP shares are trading at around 311p. In my eyes, this largely discounted price offers a wide margin of safety and the potential for growth, provided the UK economy can continue to recover steadily over the coming months and years.

The BP share price falters as $100 oil looks a distant dream

The BP (LSE:LON: ) share price has been faltering in recent weeks and is down 15% in the past month. The firm’s profitability is very much dependent on the price of oil, which has been hammered by a lack of demand. Coronavirus has undoubtedly created a challenging year for oil companies and the majors are not exempt. How oil giants like BP and Shell (LON: ) proceed over the coming months will determine their future profitability and growth.

Laying the groundwork for a stronger share price Although it is depressing for existing shareholders to see constant volatility in the BP share price, patience is key. The £62bn company appears to be sensibly opting to streamline its business and hone its strategy towards a profitable future. On Monday BP announced it is selling its petrochemicals business to Ineos, the chemicals giant, for $5bn. It expects this to complete at the end of the year. The sale brings its targeted divestments of $15bn to completion a year earlier than planned. It will also strengthen its balance sheet when cash on hand is more important than ever. This move also ties in nicely with BP’s goal to reinvent itself.

BP has a price-to-earnings ratio of 19, earnings per share are 16p and its dividend yield remains at 10% for now. This dividend makes it a very tempting stock, but analysts say a cut is likely later in the year.

$100 oil is a long way off Since the pandemic, OPEC+ members agreed to an unprecedented level of production cuts to reign in the amount of oil in storage. Meanwhile, US shale companies, not in agreement with OPEC+, have been scrambling to keep producing and storing as much as possible. A low oil price makes it harder for shale companies to remain profitable because shale is more expensive to produce than crude. This has resulted in a slew of job losses and bankruptcies, including high-profile shale driller Chesapeake Energy.

While US rig counts have been reducing, its oil inventories have been rising, reaching a record-breaking high of 541m barrels in June. You may wonder what impact the goings-on of the US energy market have on UK oil stocks, but it is important to remember the world’s oil market is intertwined. If the US has an oversupply of oil, this will suppress the oil price.

As Britain begins to open up again, the World Health Organisation has warned the coronavirus pandemic will get worse before it gets better. It is rampaging through America and the third world, and second waves are spiking in some countries that have already eased lockdown.

At the moment it looks like the oil price will stick around the $40 a barrel mark until the end of the year. On the one hand, if shale production falls far enough and global demand for oil explodes, then $100 oil could be a reality. On the other hand, cheap oil from the Middle East and a slow resurgence in demand means the likelihood of $100 oil is a distant dream. If coronavirus is eradicated, demand should return rapidly, but if countries reinforce strict lockdowns in response to second waves of the virus, recovery will be slow.

Yet I think the BP share price is cheap and is a good addition to a long-term investors portfolio, as even a 50% dividend cut would still make this a good income stock.

The stock market recovery isn’t here yet. While the rebounded strongly after the March crash, share prices are still more than 20% down on the start of the year.

This means you can still buy top FTSE 100 stocks at dirt-cheap prices, compared to the levels they were trading at in January. The recovery from the pandemic lockdown will be slow and bumpy. However, if you buy UK shares today with the aim of holding them for the long term, you should eventually reap the rewards.

I cannot tell you when stock markets will fully recover. There are some promising signs, as the Bank of England suggests we are heading for a V-shaped recovery. Today FTSE 100 stock Land Securities said it is planning to restore its dividend, as consumers start spending money again. Its share price looks dirt cheap, compared to a few months ago.

Do not invest in shares today expecting a quick return. In fact, you should never buy shares on that basis. You will almost certainly be disappointed, because nobody knows where markets will go in the short term.

Here’s why I’d buy dirt-cheap FTSE 100 shares Even the greatest investors in the world cannot repeatedly predict market movements with any success. What makes them so successful is that they know they can’t do it and don’t even try.

Instead, they build balanced portfolios of top stocks to generate long-term income and growth. You can find plenty of opportunities right now on the FTSE 100. After the stock market crash, many top companies are trading at dirt-cheap prices.

You cannot predict the next market crash but you can go looking for bargains in the aftermath of the last one. Right now, there are plenty to be found.

The stock market recovery will come in time FTSE 100 financial stocks such as insurer Aviva (LON: ) and fund manager M&G are trading at less than five times earnings. So are broadcaster ITV (LON: ) and tobacco giant Imperial Brands (LON: ) Group. Although you cannot rely too much on traditional valuation metrics right now, they are a pointer.

Housebuilders Barratt Developments (LON: ) and Taylor Wimpey (LON: ) are trading at less than 10 times earnings. So are insurer Legal & General Group (LON: ), oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), and global bank Barclays (LON: ).

I’m not saying all these would make great investments. You would have to look at them closely, to see if they are right for your portfolio. But they are big names that have made investors a lot of money in the past. They have products people want to buy, and loyal customers.

The best time to buy FTSE 100 shares like these is when they are dirt cheap. Then aim to hold them for the long term, while investing any dividends for growth.

When the stock market recovery comes, as it finally will, you will be delighted you took a chance and bought dirt-cheap FTSE 100 shares today.

Don’t wait until after the recovery, because then it will be too late.

Investing.com -- Oil prices fell on Tuesday as the spread of tighter public health measures across the U.S. intensified the fear of fresh lockdown measures, while a chilling blast from major Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) reminded the market of the challenges still ahead.

By 9:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), futures were down 1.8% at $38.99 a barrel, while the international benchmark was down 1.7% at $41.14.

Gasoline futures were flat at $1.1882 a gallon.

The outlook for demand has been clouded further in the U.S. by the reintroduction of more restrictive public health measures in parts of the country. Various counties in California and Florida have closed their beaches for the July 4 weekend due to the sharp rise in new infections of Covid-19 over the last two weeks. The states of Kansas and Oregon, meanwhile, have imposed a requirement to wear masks in indoor public spaces.

U.S. gasoline demand already appears to be weakening as the virus regains momentum. Preliminary data from the Pay With Gasbuddy app suggest U.S. gas demand fell 9% last week, according to Gas Buddy analyst Patrick de Haan.

Away from the U.S., Royal Dutch Shell followed rival BP (NYSE: ) in announcing big asset impairments as it revised down its expectations for prices over the next three years. The company said it would take a charge of as much as $22 billion in the current quarter and said it didn’t expect crude prices to return to $60 a barrel until 2023. Shell also said it expected long-run refining margins to be 30% lower than they had been before the pandemic.

And prices were also pressured by reports that Libya may soon be able to resume crude exports, after a hiatus of six months caused by the country’s civil war. Libya’s national oil company had complained last week about Russian mercenaries blockading its biggest field.

On the more supportive side, Platts reported that both Saudi Aramco (SE: ) and the UAE’s national oil company were looking at raising their official selling prices for August, something that reflects confidence that the physical market will have returned to balance by then.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/crude-oil-prices-fall-on-fears-of-fresh-lockdowns-2152291,0.08,0.891,0.029,-0.9452

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) said on Tuesday it would write off assets worth up to $22 billion (18 billion pounds) after the coronavirus crisis knocked oil and gas demand and weakened the energy price outlook.

The impairments follow the Anglo-Dutch company's decision to shift from fossil fuel and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, as laid out by CEO Ben van Beurden in April.

Global travel restrictions to prevent the virus spreading affected more than 4 billion people at one point, taking cars off the roads and grounding planes, driving down fuel demand.

Shell, the world's largest fuel retailer, said it expected a 40% drop in sales in the second quarter from a year earlier to about 4 million barrels per day (bpd), although that is more than its earlier prediction of a drop to 3.5 million bpd.

In its update before second-quarter results on July 30, Shell said upstream oil and gas production was expected to average 2.35 million bpd in the three months to June, down from 2.71 million bpd in the first quarter.

Shell, which has a market value of $126.5 billion, said it would take an aggregate post-tax impairment charge of $15 billion to $22 billion in the second quarter.

The impairments relate to large liquefied (LNG)operations in Australia, including the Prelude floating LNG facility, the world's biggest, as well as oil and gas production assets in Brazil and the U.S. shale basins.

Its shares were down 1.9% by 1014 GMT.

Credit Suisse (SIX: ) analyst Thomas Adolff said the second quarter would be the toughest for many companies and Shell had sent a ""wake up call"".

Shell's move follows BP 's (L: ) decision to cut up to $17.5 billion from its assets, as it responds to the coronavirus crisis and shifts to low-carbon energy.

Shell responded to the pandemic by cutting its dividend for the first time since World War II and lowering spending in 2020 to a maximum of $20 billion from $25 billion. It aims to announce its restructuring plan by the end of 2020.

LOWER PRICES

Shell reduced its expected average benchmark price for 2020 to $35 a barrel from $60, and cut its 2021 and 2022 forecasts to $40 and $50, respectively, also down from $60.

Shell said its long-term oil price outlook was $60. That is just below BP, which cut its long-term Brent forecast to $55 from $70. Other rivals still have higher projections.

The Anglo-Dutch group cut its long-term refining profit margin outlook by 30% and set its long-term natural gas price at $3 per million British Thermal Units (BTUs).

Shell's integrated gas business will account for $8 billion to $9 billion of the writedowns, while the upstream division will account for $4 billion to $6 billion. Downstream refining and marketing will account for another $3 billion to $7 billion.

The impairments will raise Shell's debt-to-equity ratio, or gearing, by 3%. Gearing stood at 28.9% at the end of March.",https://uk.investing.com//news/coronavirus/shell-to-write-down-as-much-as-22-billion-in-wake-of-coronavirus-2151922,0.067,0.883,0.05,-0.873

Investing.com -- China imposed its new security law on Hong Kong, prompting immediate U.S. retaliation. The July 4th weekend is looking more and more under threat of tighter lockdown measures after counties in California and Florida closed their beaches, and Kansas and Oregon ordered citizens to wear masks in indoor public spaces. Stocks are set to open mixed at the end of their best quarter in over a decade, while Jerome Powell is set to warn that the recovery is ""extraordinarily uncertain"". And Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) warned of up to $22 billion in asset impairments due to the lasting hit to oil prices from the pandemic. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, June 30th.

1 China imposes Hong Kong law; U.S. retaliates

China’s top legislative body passed a new national security law tightening Beijing’s control over the formerly autonomous city.

The U.S. government responded by withdrawing the special status on trade that it had accorded to the city.

The news came on a day when the Chinese economy gave further proof of its recovery, with the official manufacturing rising more than forecast to 50.9, and the index also rising to 54.4 from 53.6 a month ago. That was enough to push the price of above $2.70 a pound for the first time since January.

2. Powell, Mnuchin to testify as virus fears rise ahead of July 4 weekend

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will address the House Financial Services Committee later, with Powell set to warn that an economic rebound cannot be taken for granted.

“The path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus,” according to Powell’s prepared remarks, which were published by the Fed on Monday. “A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to re-engage in a broad range of activities.”

Powell’s warning comes as numerous states tighten their measures to contain the virus, threatening to complicate the coming July 4th celebrations. Counties in California and Florida have closed their beaches, while the states of Kansas and Oregon are imposing a requirement to wear masks in indoor public spaces – as is the city of Jacksonville in Florida, where the Republican Party convention is due to take place.

3 Stocks set to open mixed; Boeing's gains trimmed

U.S. stocks are set to open mixed on the last day of what is set to be their best quarter in over a decade.

By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the contract was down 54 points, or 0.2%, while the contract was down 0.1% and the contract was flat. The underperformed partly because Boeing (NYSE: ) stock was giving up gains in premarket on news of a big 737 MAX order cancellation from Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL: ).

The Nasdaq is, by contrast, being supported by strong earnings reported after the bell on Thursday by chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ) and computer hardware maker Xilinx (NASDAQ: ).

U.S. data due include the at 9:45 AM ET and the Conference Board’s index for June at 10 AM.

4. Pound weakens at Johnson prepares to spend, spend, spend

The U.K.’s plans to re-open most of its economy this weekend took a knock as the government was forced to lock down the city of Leicester (pop. 330,000) in response to rising cases of the virus.

The U.K.’s stuttering exit from its state of emergency was also illustrated by the refusal of Greece on Monday to accept direct flights from the country for another two weeks.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to give a keynote speech today on navigating a way out of the crisis by massively expanding spending on infrastructure and education.

The pound fell to a one-month low against the and remained close to a three-month low against the .

5. Shell sees possible $22 billion hit; API Inventories due

Finding a way out of the corona crisis gets no easier for the oil and gas industry. After the collapse of shale pioneer Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: ) at the weekend, Anglo-Dutch major Royal Dutch Shell said it will write down its assets by between $15 and $22 billion in the second quarter, to reflect its expectations of a lasting hit to oil prices.

The company still stuck to its long-term forecast of $60 a barrel and $3 per million Btu for , but said it will take until 2023 for prices to return to this level. For the current year, it expects an average price of $35 a barrel, rising to $40 next year.

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 retreated on Tuesday as profit-booking and fears of another lockdown to contain the relentless spread of the novel coronavirus took the shine off one of the strongest quarters for British stocks since the global financial crisis.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 ( ) was down 0.5%, with Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) being the single biggest drag after it said it would write down the value of its assets by up to $22 billion on a lower outlook for oil and gas prices.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) eased 0.1%, with auto ( ), banks ( ) and energy ( ) firms leading declines in early trading.

Is it worth buying Shell shares {{0|now}} they’re cheap?

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) shares have struggled this year. Year-to-date the stock has fallen a staggering 44%! What’s more, over the past 12 months, shares in the oil giant are off by 51%.

It’s easy to see why investor sentiment towards Shell shares has collapsed over the past year. At the peak of the coronavirus crisis, global oil demand was down by around 20% year-on-year. This had a knock-on effect on global hydrocarbon prices. Prices collapsed so fast at one point the price of oil fell into negative territory.

To cope with this turbulence, Shell’s management decided to cut the company’s dividend. The group also slashed capital spending and is planning to cut costs over the next few months.

Shell’s decision to cut its dividend for the first time since World War II, shows just how badly the crisis has impacted the company.

And today the group has announced yet another round of bad news. It has declared that it is planning to write down the value of its assets by as much as $22bn to reflect lower oil and gas prices for the next few years.

Shell shares on offer However, despite all of the above, Shell shares look cheap at current levels. The stock is trading at one of the lowest levels in recent memory.

What’s more, even though the company has recently slashed its annual dividend payout, the stock is still set to yield 6.7% for 2020 and 2021. This looks extremely attractive at a time when so many other companies have eliminated their dividends altogether.

These figures suggest that Shell shares offer a margin of safety at current levels. As such, now may be a good time to snap up the stock while it looks cheap relative to history.

Clearly, the company is going to face further headwinds in the near term. The coronavirus crisis continues to rumble on in the background, and this may impact the demand for oil and gas for many years to come. Nonetheless, to some extent, this lower demand is already reflected in the Shell share price.

The group has already decided to preemptively cut its dividend and write down the value of its assets. So, the company may now be past the worst.

And over the long term, Shell is well-positioned to capitalise on the global economic recovery.

Green energy Over the past few years, the organisation has been repositioning itself, away from oil and gas towards renewable energy and electricity supply. These efforts should help the business prosper as the world moves away from dirty hydrocarbon products, towards green power and technologies.

Shell is one of the few large energy companies to have made such a dramatic change to its operations, which suggests the company’s services could be in demand over the next few years. This only supports the investment case for Shell shares at the current depressed levels.

The oil market has been having a troubling few months. Today, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) followed rival BP (LON: ) in writing-down assets due to lower expected crude prices. With these new expectations in place, is the Shell share price now a bargain?

Do I like the Shell share price? It is not the answer we like to hear, but I think at this point “yes and no” is the most accurate response to the question. In the past I have been a fan of the company in large part because of its dividend. Unfortunately this is no longer a factor. Looking at the Shell share price however, it may still be a worthwhile investment.

Today the company said it will be writing-down $22bn in assets due to a lowering of its oil and gas price expectations. This follows a similar move by BP earlier this month, with both companies accounting for a bleaker future thanks to coronavirus.

I agree it now seems likely that lower crude prices over the next year will hurt the oil majors. After that though, I am not so sure. To a certain extent, the coronavirus troubles hit at the worst time for crude. The oil market was already weak due to oversupply.

The problems were exacerbated by Covid fears that arguably surpassed the fundamental troubles the market will face. After today’s write-down, as I write this, Shell’s share price stands less than 2% lower on the day. From a low of £9.70 in mid-March, it is still up 37%. The initial fear, it seems, has died down.

Shell said that while it now expects a crude price of $50 a barrel in 2022, its estimates beyond that point remain the same at $60. Admittedly, at £13 a share it is hard to call the Shell share price cheap in this risky environment. That all depends on the future, however.

The green revolution One major point being cited as a result of recent troubles with oil, is that it may act as a catalyst to quicken efforts towards green energy. Indeed, both Shell and BP have said as much. Both companies already had a commitment to moving towards green energy before this.

This makes sense from a PR point of view, and also from a financial one. If they are truly part of a dying industry, either because of public opinion or oil supply, diversifying is a way to secure their future businesses.

However, as much as people don’t want to hear it, practical renewable energy is still a long way off. To date, none of the alternatives could realistically hope to replace oil and gas globally. Ironically, the oil giants like Shell may be best placed to find alternatives. Historically, companies looking for profit have been far more successful in developing products than those driven by altruism alone.

In the meantime, will still be king. If supplies do become harder to come by, prices will go up. Companies like Shell could be making more money, not less. I am certainly comfortable holding on to my Shell shares for quite a while yet.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) said on Tuesday it has agreed to buy renewable gas, known as biomethane, from Denmark's Nature Energy, in what the smaller company termed the largest deal of its kind.

The gas will be supplied to Europe's pipeline network from July 1. The size and financial details of the contract were not disclosed.

In April, Shell laid out the oil and gas sector's most extensive strategy yet to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.

Biogas, produced from methanisation of agricultural and other biological waste, could play a key role in Europe's ambitions to become a low-carbon society.

""Biomethane has an important role to play in the energy transition,"" said Jonathan McCloy, head of gas at Shell Energy Europe.

""This purchase is an important part of our work to provide a range of lower-carbon energy choices for our customers across Europe.""

Denmark and Germany are pioneers in the nascent biomethane industry, which still depends on government support and has yet to see the breakthroughs in technology and scale seen in wind and solar power.

Biogas competes in Europe with cheaper imports from countries like Russia and Algeria.

Depending on continued political support, biogas has the potential to supply Denmark's entire gas consumption by 2035, up from one-fifth now, according to Nature Energy Chief Executive Ole Hvelplund.

Nature Energy plans to produce 170 million cubic metres of gas from its ten plants this year, a tiny fraction of Europe's total consumption.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-secures-biogas-supply-as-part-lowcarbon-shift-2152678,0.009,0.875,0.116,0.9766

Investing.com -- The bell tolled again for Big Oil on Tuesday as Royal Dutch Shell said it would write down its assets by as much as $22 billion in the second quarter to reflect expectations of a lasting hit to oil and gas prices from the pandemic.

The news comes only a couple of months after the Anglo-Dutch giant cut its dividend for the first time since World War 2. It again underlines the risk that much of its asset portfolio may never be economically viable again, given the determination of many governments to ‘build back better’ after the pandemic, i.e., to use the crisis to accelerate the transition to low-carbon fuels.

There’s a certain irony, then, in the fact that Shell’s gas portfolio is taking the biggest hit, at between $8 billion and $9 billion. The company had paid top dollar to bolster its position in gas only four years ago with the acquisition of BG Group, believing that it was destined to displace both coal and liquids in the global energy mix.

The gas impairments will affect mostly its assets in Australia, which are in essence a play on future Asian demand.

By contrast, the upstream portfolio will be written down by ‘only’ $4 billion to $6 billion. That will affect mainly its operations in Brazil and its shale assets in the U.S. The downstream assets will be written down by between $3 billion and $7 billion.

While the company has stuck to its long-term oil price forecast of $60 a barrel, it believes that average prices won’t return to that level until 2023. For the current year, it sees prices averaging $35, rising to $40 a barrel next year and $50 in 2022. Shell also expects refining margins to be 30% lower on average over the long term than it had expected before the pandemic.

Ominously, having cut its precious dividend and suspended share buybacks to preserve its balance sheet, Shell said on Tuesday that it still expects gearing (net debt relative to total capital) to rise by much as three percentage points.

Royal Dutch Shell A (LON: ) shares fell 2.9% in London on the news, despite the fact that the market has already wiped over $100 billion off the company’s valuation this year in anticipation of exactly such moves. It’s down by 41% year-to-date, underperforming not only the benchmark , but also the Stoxx Oil and Gas index, which is down only 31%.

While the challenges of the pandemic and de-carbonization affect all companies in the sector, that underperformance suggests the market is losing confidence in Shell’s historic ability to at least deliver best-in-class returns, epitomized by the now-reduced dividend.

Rival BP (NYSE: ) was able to boast after its $5 billion deal to sell its petrochemicals business to Ineos on Monday that it was at least ahead of schedule in meeting its target for asset disposals. Shell, by contrast, still seems wedded to scale: it said no word of intentions to slim down any further in its release on Tuesday. Until it can shed the assets in greatest danger of being stranded, the risk of being perceived as behind the curve seems likely to grow.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-shell-takes-another-massive-hit-from-pandemic-2152007,0.055,0.875,0.071,0.7615

(Bloomberg) -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc will write down between $15 billion and $22 billion in the second quarter, as the company gave investors a wider glimpse of just how severely the coronavirus crisis has hit Big Oil.

The pandemic left no part of the energy giant’s sprawling business unscathed. Oil production slowed, fuel sales fell and shipments of everything from liquefied to petrochemicals suffered.

The dire second quarter also threatened to have a lasting legacy, as reductions in long-term price forecasts will force writedowns on the value of assets all over the world, with its integrated gas business taking the biggest hit.

The drop in demand comes as little surprise. Oil majors’ earnings took a beating in the first quarter, and the companies warned that things would only get worse as the full impact of the pandemic started to be felt in March. Despite a recent rebound in consumption in some of the worst-hit countries, resurgent waves of the virus show the recovery remains fragile.

Oil-product sales volumes will be 3.5 million to 4.5 million barrels a day in the second quarter, down from 6.6 million a year earlier, driven by a “significant drop” in demand because of the pandemic, the oil major said Tuesday in a statement ahead of quarterly results on July 30.

Shell said it has revised its mid- and long-term pricing and refining margin outlook, and expects gearing -- a measure of debt -- to increase by as much as 3% due to the impairment charges.

Drastic Changes

The coronavirus has exposed the vulnerability of some of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies, but also given them the opportunity to make investors swallow some unpleasant remedies. Since the pandemic started, Shell and BP (NYSE: ) Plc have made drastic changes to their businesses, from multibillion-dollar writedowns to big cuts to dividends and jobs.

They explained these moves as responses to the dual threats of the lockdown-induced oil slump and the growing pressure to cut carbon emissions. BP has said oil and gas prices will be lower than expected in the coming decades as the virus hurts long-term demand and accelerates the shift to cleaner energy.

Shell’s in-house trading unit, which can be a boon when other parts of the business are hurting, won’t provide respite this quarter. Trading and optimizations results “are expected to be below average,” the company said. That compares to 2019, when Shell - as with the many of the world’s largest energy traders - enjoyed one of its best years in gas trading.

The company indicated more pain to come from LNG sales, which have a price lag of 3 to 6 months compared with oil. The impact of crude prices on LNG margins became “more prominent” from June.

Longer term, Shell is optimistic about the LNG market, with Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden telling Bloomberg in an interview in May that he expects the market to recover to pre-virus levels.

In April, Van Beurden cut the company’s dividend for the first time since the Second World War. In May, the Anglo-Dutch major said it would be well-placed to boost shareholder payouts again once the oil market recovers.

It’s been a tough few months for BP (LSE: LON: ). Oversupply in the oil market was exacerbated when coronavirus hit. Crude prices plummeted, and as it stands, the market is still unsure what the post-lockdown world will look like.

That’s why, this month, the company was forced to write down about $17.5bn from its oil and gas assets. Specifically, it reduced its outlook on prices in the wake of coronavirus. Despite this, however, the BP share price has managed to hold on fairly well.

Job cuts, debt and dividends The week before its asset write-down, BP announced it would be cutting 10,000 jobs – about 15% of its workforce – by the end of this year. Most of this number will come from office-based staff, “protecting the front line of the company”.

The share price was actually higher on this news for a few days. Cost-cutting efforts being seen by investors as a sensible move. Interestingly too, BP is still maintaining its dividend.

Personally I agree with my fellow Fool Edward Sheldon, I expect at some point in the future BP will be forced to cut its dividend. It’s hard to justify cutting staff while maintaining investor payouts.

I suspect BP is simply waiting for a more opportune time. In a fearful market, it makes sense to not give investors any extra reasons to go running for the door. I suspect when things calm down towards the latter half of 2020, it will be reviewing its payout.

Interestingly, just days after the asset write-down, BP announced it would be raising $12bn through the issuance of hybrid bonds. The main aim of this is to strengthen BP’s balance sheet — the firm having some of the highest levels of debt in the industry.

BP oil or BP green energy? With concern for the environment being stronger than ever, oil majors having been making greater efforts to go green. On the image front, oil companies need to be seen as trying to move towards greener energy.

From a practical perspective, if oil runs out or becomes too expensive to extract, renewable energy sources could be a massive profit maker. Companies like BP and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) have known the writing was on the wall for a while.

Accordingly, both companies have been making greater efforts in the green market. This kind of adaptability has been a selling point for me as an investor. With this latest asset write-down, BP has suggested the expected fall in demand for oil will bring these efforts forward.

I think that with its cost-cutting efforts, investments in a greener economy and an understanding investor base if its reduces tis dividend, the BP share price may be able to see better times ahead.

LONDON (Reuters) - When BP (LON: ) slashed its long-term oil price outlook last week, prospects in Canada and Angola were rendered worthless, company sources and analysts said, exposing broader risks the industry faces as the world pivots to low-carbon energy.

The $17.5 billion (£13.9 billion) write-down, part of Chief Executive Bernard Looney's drive to wean BP off fossil fuel, was the biggest the London-based company booked since the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.

BP lowered its long-term oil price outlook from about $70 a barrel to $55, slashing the value of its $14.2 billion early-stage exploration portfolio by two thirds. It also wrote down $8 billion to $11 billion in the value of producing assets.

BP did not detail which assets were rendered uneconomical by the price adjustment, but company sources said they included three areas, including resources in Canadian oil sands and ultra-deepwater wells off Angola, which involve high costs.

An analysis by consultancy Rystad Energy also showed BP's exploration impairments would include mainly Canada and Angola.

A BP spokesman declined to comment.

BP holds interests in three oil sands lease areas through the Sunrise Oil Sands project with Husky Energy, the Terre de Grace partnership with Value Creation and the Pike Oil Sands project with Canadian National Resources.

Canada's oil sands require complex and energy-intensive extraction processes that cause heavy carbon pollution.

""We recognise that oil sands projects raise environmental challenges and we are actively seeking ways to undertake these projects while minimising the environmental footprint,"" BP said on its website.

BP's 2019 annual report said the Canadian oil sand exploration resource was valued at $2.5 billion, while Angola's so-called ""intangible assets"" were valued between $1 billion to $2 billion.

""BP's revision makes their oil price outlook more realistic,"" said Parul Chopra, vice president for upstream research at Rystad Energy.

""Oil sand projects in Canada have breakevens more than $45 per barrel and many ultra-deepwater projects in Angola, Brazil and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have similar high breakeven prices.""

STRANDED ASSETS

BP's new forecast of $55 a barrel, an average for the benchmark until 2050, is much lower than assumptions made by several rivals, some of whose forecasts are $70 or more, suggesting they face the risk of large impairments in future.

The lower forecast highlights the risk of stranded assets, or oil and gas resources that can not be tapped if the world wants to meet targets in the 2015 Paris climate agreement to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by the end of the century.

Looney's predecessor Bob Dudley had previously dismissed the idea that BP had stranded assets.

Long-term price forecasts vary across the industry. At the lower end of the scale, the International Energy Agency lists an average oil price of $59 a barrel in 2040, based on its sustainable development scenario calculated against 2018 prices.

Meanwhile, Spain's Repsol (MC: ) booked 5.7 billion euros in upstream asset impairments, even when assuming oil would rise to $87 in 2035.

A Shell (LON: ) spokeswoman said its financial outlook was based on an oil price of about $65 by 2025.

Equinor assumes a price of $80 in 2030. A spokesman for the Norwegian state-owned oil company said cutting the assumption to $50 would reduce Equinor's net present value (NPV) by 17%.

Italy's Eni lists $70 as its long-term oil price assumption, although Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said the firm still did not have stranded assets in a $50 scenario.

""The clock must be ticking on the assumptions used at Eni and in particular Equinor,"" said Andrew Grant at think-tank Carbon Tracker, which estimates oil majors would have to cut output by 35% from 2019 to 2040 to meet Paris targets.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/bps-stranded-canadian-angolan-assets-expose-wider-industry-risks-2148167,0.041,0.851,0.109,0.9927

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks finally succumbed to investor worries about a second wave of coronavirus cases after managing to shrug off concerns earlier in the week.

The sank more than 700 points on Wednesday, and tech giants could not maintain their record-setting pace.

Businesses across the U.S. are trying to reopen even though new hotspots continue to pop up. That has led to worries that the progress will be interrupted by a fresh round of Covid-19 shutdowns. Already, Apple (NASDAQ: ) has been forced to reclose some of its retail stores, announcing the shuttering of seven stores in the Houston area beginning Thursday.

Restaurant groups, retailers, and travel and leisure stocks could feel more pain if new shutdowns are ordered. And the oil sector, which has staged a comeback from a sharp drop in demand in March and April, is feeling pressure because of the slow pace of recovery.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.

1. Earnings Reports Show Uneven Effect of Covid-19 Shutdowns

Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE: ), which owns the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, is scheduled to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings Thursday before the opening bell. It's already a bleak outlook, with analysts tracked by Investing.com looking for a loss of $1.71 a share on revenue of $1.2 billion.

Meanwhile, sports apparel maker Nike Inc (NYSE: ) is set to report fourth quarter earnings after the closing bell, and analysts are expecting earnings of 12 cents a share on revenue of $7.4 billion.

2. Oil Sector in Spotlight After Mixed Data

fell more nearly 6% on Wednesday after the government said rose more than expected. At the same time, production also showed a surprising gain, indicating shale producers are back at work with West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, trading around $38 a barrel.

Energy has been the worst performing sector of the S&P 500 this year despite staging a comeback since March and April, when demand for oil and oil products plummeted because of Covid-19 business shutdowns. Oil's sell-off on Wednesday also pressured shares of big oil companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) B PLC (NYSE: ).

3. Investors Watch for the Trend in Jobless Claims

Also on Thursday, the government will report its weekly unemployment numbers. The progress has been good, but unemployment is still at post World War II highs. for the week ending June 21 are expected to be 1.3 million, while are expected to be 19.9 million. Both would be down from the number of claims filed the prior week.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-3-things-to-watch-for-june-25-2148589,0.064,0.896,0.04,-0.9177

(Reuters) - A rally in consumer stocks and a battered pound helped London's FTSE 100 outperform world stocks at the end of a choppy week on Friday as investors weighed optimism about a revival in business activity against a surge in global coronavirus infections.

Broader Europe ( ) and Wall Street were firmly in the red on fears of further restrictions to business activity which could cast a pall on hopes of any economic recovery.

London's blue-chip FTSE 100 ( ) closed up 0.2% but a defensive rally showed evidence of investor worry. British American Tobacco (L: ), Reckit Benckiser (L: ), Unilever (L: ) and Tesco (L: ) were among the biggest boosts.

The pound , meanwhile, slid on doubts about Britain's trade pact with the European Union. This helped gains in some of the internationally focused companies on the blue-chip index. Investors will be watchful of the next round of Brexit talks set to begin on Monday.

On the week, the FTSE 100 fell 3.2%. The index has recovered more than 35% since March lows but is still down about 18% this year. Researchers warn of a second wave of infections as the government looks to ease further lockdown restrictions next month.

""There are still big question marks over how willing households will be to go out and spend if fear of the virus lingers. And we are concerned that a second wave of unemployment will reduce the ability of households to spend,"" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.

""As a result, we suspect that the initial strong rebound will peter out in the second half of 2020 and that the government and the Bank of England will need to do more.""

Britain's mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) ended Friday flat.

The 2 best FTSE 100 shares I’d buy {{0|now}}

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio AV -0.90% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LCO -0.11% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio CL -0.17% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

I think your best chance to beat a market trending sideways is to buy the best shares as cheaply as you possibly can. Then simply wait for regular dividends and reinvest to compound your gains. No fuss, no muss.

Both of these highly-popular FTSE 100 companies shocked the market by halting or cutting dividends in the depths of the Covid crisis. But I think investors can be reasonably confident that dividends will return in full force by Q4 2020.

At current share prices, the yields would be a tidy 8% to 9%.

So I’d say these two are the best FTSE 100 shares that I’d buy now to achieve more wealth.

Playing favourites Aviva (LSE:LON: ) is a low-debt, well-managed multinational savings and insurance company. So why is this on my list of the best FTSE 100 shares to buy?

Firstly, it’s undervalued by any metric: a P/E ratio of 4.5, price-to-book value of 0.6 and super-cheap price-to-sales ratio of 0.15.

Secondly, it is still winning very large contracts even in the midst of all this chaos.

Take for example a £95m bulk annuity deal with the British Bankers Association in late May. This will be a large and ongoing revenue generator.

Trustee director Sean Burnard said the deal with Aviva “represents excellent value” and is “a real lesson in positive collaboration.” That’s the kind of service I like to hear about.

Lastly, when sentiment turned more positive from early May to early June, the Aviva share price gathered steam for a 30% rise up to 296p.

While Aviva CEO Maurice Tulloch decided to halt the 2019 dividend on 8 April, I think it’s a prudent cash saving measure. And he will revisit the decision in Q4 2020. I’m happy to hold until then.

Second-best FTSE 100 share? The same sort of thing has happened with Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE:RDSB). When oil prices bombed in February, the Shell share price dived as low as 982p. It has reclaimed 1,335p at time of writing.

That’s a 30% rise from the depths of the first-wave Covid crash. And a P/E of 6.8 is nothing for what I believe is one of the best FTSE 100 shares.

Since April’s shock headlines about negative oil prices, the US benchmark has climbed to $38 a barrel while has recovered to $40 a barrel. So Shell won’t be losing money for every barrel it pumps.

But when CEO Ben van Beurden cut the company’s dividend for the first time since the Second World War, it still came as a shock.

Chair of the board Chad Holliday then reminded his colleagues that “shareholder returns are a fundamental part of Shell’s financial framework”. He’s not wrong.

Shell has been paying ever-growing dividends like clockwork for decades. This regularity earned the oil supermajor an army of keen income investors. And I’d expect bosses to revisit the decision by the end of this year, at least.

Like Aviva, Shell has been making big deals to ensure its cost-cutting measures are not for nought. That’s what makes it one of the best FTSE 100 shares.

Just last week it announced a major renewable energy project under its drive to become carbon neutral by 2050. It joins BP (LON: ) to build two utility-scale solar panel projects across Trinidad & Tobago.

In my opinion, these are the best FTSE 100 shares that should top your buying list.

The FTSE 100: a look at my predictions for 2020

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio US500 +0.57% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HSBA -1.33% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LGEN -3.11% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio DGE -0.91% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SGE +1.58% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ULVR -0.47% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BT -0.71% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

At the start of the year, I listed a number of predictions for the in 2020. I didn’t list any specific price level forecasts for the index, as realistically no one knows what level stock market indexes will rise or fall to in the short term. What I did do, however, is make some predictions as to how the FTSE 100 could behave in 2020.

Now that we are halfway through the year, let’s look at how those predictions have fared.

A decent pullback My first prediction was that we would see at least one decent pullback in 2020. I said at the time: “I don’t think it will take much to see another stock market dip in the near future.”

It’s fair to say this prediction was on the money. In February, the FTSE 100 began to fall sharply due to Covid-19 uncertainty, and by mid-March, the index was down about 35% for the year. So, it didn’t take too long for this prediction to eventuate.

One out of one so far, then.

Big dividends My next prediction was that the FTSE 100 would continue to pay out big dividends to investors. I said the index was likely to throw off a “huge amount of cash” in the form of dividends.

This prediction has not been as accurate as I would have liked it to be. That’s because a large number of companies in the FTSE 100 have either suspended or cancelled their dividends due to Covid-19 uncertainty.

Plenty of FTSE 100 companies have paid big dividends to investors, though. For example, in the last month, I’ve personally received dividend payments from the likes of Legal & General, Unilever (LON: ) and Sage.

However, due to Covid-19, it’s not going to be a vintage year for UK dividend investors. We’re not going to see £90bn+ paid out to investors like AJ Bell predicted at the start of the year.

Overall, I’m going to give myself a half-mark here.

Weighed down by underperformers Finally, I predicted that the FTSE 100 index would be “weighed down by underperformers.” I said that the index’s heavy exposure to industries such as oil & gas, banking, and tobacco, as well as its exposure to debt-laden companies, could act as a drag on the index.

This prediction has been accurate. So far this year, the FTSE 100 has been weighed down by a number of big players within the index. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), for example, is down over 40% year to date. HSBC is down roughly 35%. BT Group (LON: ) is down 41%. As a result, the FTSE 100 has underperformed other major stock market indexes such as the , by a wide margin.

Another full mark here, taking my total score to two-and-a-half out of three. Not a bad effort.

My FTSE 100 predictions: key takeaways If there’s one takeaway from the performance of the FTSE 100 this year, it’s that picking stocks, instead of investing in the whole index through a tracker fund, can pay off.

While the FTSE 100 index, as a whole, is down nearly 20% for the year, some companies, including the likes of Unilever (up 2%) and Reckitt Benckiser (up 19%), have held up quite well.

Similarly, while over 40 FTSE 100 companies have suspended or cancelled their dividends, others such as Sage and Diageo (LON: ) have continued paying them.

Ultimately, owning the right FTSE 100 stocks can make a big difference to your investment returns.

(Reuters) - U.S. lender Wells Fargo (N: ) said on Wednesday it had signed multi-year purchase agreements for renewable energy with Royal Dutch Shell's (L: ) units, as it progresses towards its clean energy goals.

The agreements would involve the development of new utility-scale solar installations in several counties, the lender said in a statement.

Wells Fargo did not disclose the size of its investment but said it would be able to meet the energy needs of about 1,200 properties in California and the mid-Atlantic states.

Many corporates have committed billions of dollars to fund green projects and pledged to reduce their carbon footprint, while some banks have said they would cut exposure to fossil fuel funding.

DENVER/OSLO (Reuters) - The companies that operate offshore drilling rigs for major oil producers face a second wave of bankruptcies in four years amid a historic drop in energy prices that likely will leave surviving drillers more closely tied to big oil firms.

A collapse of the offshore industry will have broad impact. Drillers and their suppliers have driven innovation that has helped shale and offshore wind companies by pioneering remote monitoring and control, and last year directly generated about 25% of global oil production.

The offshore services business is the worst performing of the oilfield services sector, with shares of the 10 largest publicly traded down 77% since the start of the year.

Four of the seven largest offshore drillers - Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc (NYSE: ) , Noble Corp (N: ), Seadrill Ltd (N: ) and Valaris Plc (N: ) - have sought protection from creditors or begun debt restructuring talks that could lead to bankruptcy.

Two others are reaching out to their creditors. Pacific Drilling (N: ) last month said it may need to modify terms of its debt, and was seeking alternative funding in the event creditors would not accept new terms. Shelf Drilling (OL: ), the ninth largest by revenue, is seeking talks with creditors over loan covenants that take effect next year, executives said.

The latest offshore industry's turmoil ""is going to change things in many ways,"" Odfjell Drilling Chief Executive Simen Lieungh said in an interview. ""Existing players and the existing structures will probably not be there as today,"" he said referring to companies scrapping rigs.

EARLY OPTIMISM FADES

The sector had limped along as exploration fell due to high costs and the advent of cheaper U.S. shale. Then, a flurry of giant discoveries off the coasts of South America and Africa rekindled oil majors' interest in deep water projects and led to a boom in offshore leases two years ago.

Drillers began the year predicting a recovery with oil prices ( ) at $60 per barrel. But optimism soured as the pandemic crushed demand and oil prices fell below $20 in April.

This month, the number of floating rigs at work is expected to hit the lowest level since 1986 as oil companies cancel or defer contracts, said industry executives and analysts.

The last downturn was cushioned by help from oil producers. Between 2014 and 2016, as crude fell to $26 per barrel from over $100, oil majors spread work among drillers to keep exploring off the coasts of Brazil, Mozambique and in the Mediterranean. That allowed drillers whose rig contracts were canceled to pick up some jobs, albeit at lower lease rates.

The offshore industry was financially stronger then. Many had entered that downturn with large order backlogs and held contracts with lease rates higher than today's, said Jorn Madsen, CEO of Maersk Drilling (CO: ).

But with oil majors this year slashing their own spending by between 30% and 50% to preserve cash and pay dividends there is no safety net. Winners will be those companies that get debts refinanced and get through the next two years, said industry officials.

Offshore service firms may need to scrap up to 200 of the about 800 existing floating rigs to regain profitable lease rates, said David Carter Shinn, head of analysis for rig brokerage Bassoe Offshore.

There is little hope for a rebound in the next few years. Many oil producers are withdrawing from projects that require $60 per barrel to earn a profit, concluding it could be years before they see that price again. Chevron (N: ), Exxon Mobil (N: ), Petronas (KL: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) ended drilling contracts early this year to save money.

""Higher cost production in our industry will be shut in and projects will be delayed,"" said Rick Fowler, chief operating officer at U.S. offshore oil producer LLOG Exploration.

Chevron said it will limit offshore work to fields that connect to existing infrastructure rather than start new exploration. Exxon, BP (L: ), Total (PA: ) and Shell declined to comment or did not reply to requests for comment on the impact on their drilling plans.

The abrupt halt of exploration has been devastating to drillers. They are writing down billions of dollars on the value of their fleets.

Finding new money will be difficult, said Basil Karampelas, a managing director at SierraConstellation Partners who advises companies on financial restructurings.

Bankruptcy investors evaluate companies on 13-week or 26-week cash flows in making decisions, he said. But for many drillers, there will be little to show. Creditors, he said, ""will have to decide if they want to ante up to get past that period.""

THE PATH AHEAD

Many of the offshore drillers are scrapping or retiring vessels, having concluded it may be years before they are needed again. Valaris plans to scrap 11 rigs and put aside nine others, estimating it may take two years before they are needed again.

Seadrill, which slipped into bankruptcy in 2017 after the last oil price downturn, pioneered a model for sharing costs that might prove a path forward, said analysts.

It formed joint ventures with customers including a Qatar Petroleum spinoff and Sonangol Group that have survived the last downturn. The joint ventures focused on oil fields that have long lives and gave drillers a way to lower their contract risks.

The Seadrill ventures ""have delivered increased fleet utilization and incremental access to markets that are expected to show significant growth over the coming years,"" Seadrill spokesman Ian Cracknell said.

""It could be one of the few options to move forward,"" said William Turner, a vice president at Welligence Energy Analytics. ""There is not a lot more folks can do to lower costs, especially in deepwater. They are going to have to get creative to survive,"" he said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/with-contracts-canceled-and-debts-mounting-offshore-oil-drillers-face-another-shakeout-2147774,0.055,0.866,0.079,0.9816

499,499,SHEL,2020-06-23,Are BP shares the bargain of the decade? By The Motley Fool,"Published Jun 23, 2020 15:24 Updated Jun 23, 2020 15:40

Are BP shares the bargain of the decade?

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LCO -0.11% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

BP (LSE: LON: ) shares were trading at over 500p earlier this year. Today, you can pick them up for just 324p. Furthermore, this blue-chip has paid out dividends totalling 32.67p over the last four quarters. As such, its running yield is a whopping 10.1%.

Clearly, the company faces near-term headwinds. However, the deeply discounted shares suggest there is the potential for high capital gains, if we see a more favourable macro backdrop in the longer term. Meanwhile, there’s that juicy 10.1% yield. Could BP shares be the bargain of the decade?

BP shares outlook Does BP have the financial strength for near-term survival? In an update last week, the company shared with us its new long-term assumptions for oil and gas prices. It’s working on the basis of an average $55 a barrel and $2.90 per mmBtu Henry Hub through to 2050. Previously, its assumptions were $70 and $4 respectively.

This change to the long-term outlook has a near-term impact. For the current quarter, management estimates impairment charges and exploration intangible write-offs will be in the range of $13bn to $17.5bn. While these are non-cash items, I calculate they’d ratchet balance sheet gearing to over 40% from 36% at the end of the first quarter.

However, two days later, BP raised $12bn with a hybrid bond issue. Such bonds are reflected on the balance sheet as equity rather than debt. As both cash and total equity increase by $12bn, it produces a material improvement in gearing. I reckon gearing at the half-year-end won’t be too different to the end of Q1. As such, I think BP has the financial strength for near-term survival.

But will the dividend survive? BP’s dividend payout is running at about $2bn per quarter. In theory, the $12bn from the bond issue could support the dividend for the next six quarters. However, I believe it would be sensible for the company to rebase its payout. Indeed, I think a rebasing is very much on the cards.

BP reckons the Covid-19 pandemic will have “an enduring impact on the global economy, with the potential for weaker demand for energy for a sustained period”. Management also has “a growing expectation that the aftermath of the pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy”.

With the company’s reduced long-term price assumptions for oil and gas, and the potential need to accelerate investment to fulfil its goal of becoming a carbon net zero company by 2050 or sooner, I think the board will have to rein back on dividend largesse.

Would I buy BP shares today? Looking first at the dividend, what would a rebasing do to the yield for buyers at the current price? A 33% reduction would give a yield of 6.7%, a 50% reduction a yield of 5%, and a 66% reduction (as Shell (LON: ) has done) a yield of 3.4%.

What of the potential for high capital gains in the longer term? We know new chief executive Bernard Looney has a target of net zero by 2050. What we don’t know is how exactly he’s planning to get there. Details on this are expected at a capital markets day in September. Looney will have to convince the market his strategy can create shareholder value.

As things currently stand, I can’t see BP shares as the buy of the decade. However, it’s a stock I’m watching for dividend developments and Looney’s September presentation.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Britain's supreme court will on Tuesday hear Nigerian farmers and fishermen appeal to pursue claims against oil major Shell (L: ) over spills in the Niger Delta.

The appeal re-opens the possibility for British multinationals to be held liable at home for their subsidiaries' actions abroad. It comes after a setback in 2018 when a London court ruled that the claim could not be pursued in England.

The Ogale and Bille communities allege that Shell's oil operations have polluted their land and waters. They are seeking justice through British courts because cases heard in Nigeria can take decades to resolve, said Leigh Day, the law firm representing the farmers and fishermen.

The main question for the courts is whether they have jurisdiction over claims against Shell's Nigerian subsidiary Shell Petroleum Development Company, which is jointly operated with the Nigerian government.

Shell's subsidiary has said ""claims by Nigerian communities against a Nigerian company about events in Nigeria should be heard in Nigeria and not the UK"".

The Nigerian unit says the spills are chiefly due to oil theft, sabotage and illegal refining. The communities maintain they cannot seek redress locally.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/british-supreme-court-hears-nigerians-case-in-shell-oil-spill-claim-2146975,0.045,0.912,0.043,-0.1027

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) will announce a major restructuring by the end of the year as the energy company prepares to accelerate its shift towards low-carbon, CEO Ben van Beurden told employees, a company source said.

In a video interview published on Shell's internal website, van Beurden said that the restructuring would involve job cuts as part of broad cost reductions, although no figures have been decided yet, according to sources who saw the interview.

""Ben spoke about positioning the company in the energy transition,"" one of the sources said. ""The company will announce the new shape of the organisation by the end of the year.""

The new structure will not take effect before 2021.

Forget cash, bonds and annuities! I’d buy these 5 FTSE 100 shares for a rising passive income

Top shares may have slashed dividends after the stock market crash but don’t despair, plenty are still paying out.

You can still generate the dividends you need to get rich and retire early, by building a portfolio of top FTSE 100 shares. As returns on cash, bonds and annuities collapse, shares still look the best way to generate a rising passive income for your retirement.

Investment platform Interactive Investor has just issued a list of the UK’s five top dividend stocks, and you won’t be surprised at the names. Especially when you see the list is headed by pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline. It has been a top income stock for years.

Get the income you need Glaxo has frozen its dividend at 80p for years, as it diverts money into replenishing its drugs pipeline. That now looks a farsighted policy. This top FTSE 100 income share still yields 4.8%, thrashing cash.

Big pharma rival AstraZeneca also features in the top five. It generates a relatively low 2.6%, partly down to strong share price growth. Astra is expensive at more than 25 times earnings (against 14x for Glaxo), but this is a quality long-term buy-and-hold.

Tobacco giant Imperial Brands (LON: ) Group is the only one of these five FTSE 100 shares to cut its recent dividend, by a third. That was a painful move, the first in 24 years. As Interactive Investor points out, this will help Imperial Brands manage its £14bn debt and absorb the coronavirus hit. It is still forecast to yield 9.6%. Also, it trades at a bargain price 6.1 times forecast earnings.

Inevitably, oil giant BP (LON: ) features in the famous five FTSE 100 shares. It actually increased its first-quarter dividend payout, by 2.5%, handing £1.7bn to shareholders. This is doubly impressive as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) scrapped its long-standing dividend altogether.

I’d buy these 5 FTSE 100 shares for retirement This may not last. BPs net debt now stands at $51bn. That’s due to acquisitions, capital investment and the oil price slump, but also years of share buybacks and dividend payments. New boss Bernard Looney’s move to announce £14bn of write-downs may pave the way for a second-quarter dividend cut. Given today’s high yield of 9.6%, investors may be willing to take the hit.

I’m pleased to see Phoenix Group Holdings feature in the FTSE 100 income share top five, as the insurance consolidator is a favourite of mine. It has a low-risk business model and recently justified my faith by hiking its dividend, by 1.74%. Right now, it yields a forecast 7.4% too.

That easily beats the 1% you are likely to get on cash or 2% to 3% on bonds, while avoiding the rigidity of annuities.

Dividends are never guaranteed, but over time should help you generate a rising passive income for a happier retirement.

(Bloomberg) -- U.K. equities have underperformed every year since the 2016 referendum, and have been a consensus underweight among money managers. Just as the long-shunned market was starting to recover from years of political instability and uncertainty over ties with the European Union, the coronavirus pandemic has left the country facing its worst recession in 300 years.

As the lockdown gradually eases, with English pubs, restaurants and cinemas set to reopen in July, clarity on negotiations with the EU before the end of the transition agreement in December may revive investor interest in a market that’s trading near historically cheap levels.

The has lagged behind major indexes over the past four years, and in local currency terms is trading near levels it was at just before the vote four years ago. In dollar terms, its underperformance is even more striking, with a nearly 20% drop.

A tentative market recovery following Boris Johnson’s decisive electoral victory has been hampered by the lockdowns in the country that’s among the worst hit by Covid-19. A collapse in oil prices has also dragged on the megacap FTSE 100, given the almost 12% weight of energy stocks in the index.

Years of underperformance have pushed U.K. stocks’ discount to global equities to an extreme, one of the reasons the U.K. is the most preferred equity market in UBS Wealth Management’s asset allocation. The manager sees an improvement in earnings revisions on the back of higher oil prices, while noting the recent underperformance.

“The U.K. market should benefit from a rotation out of defensive growth stocks into value names, given its large exposure to value sectors such as basic materials, energy, and banks, which account for a combined 40% of the FTSE 100,” UBS WM strategist Claudia Panseri wrote in a note last week.

The exposure could be a double-edged sword. While the U.K. is traditionally seen as a high-dividend market, the pandemic’s impact has resulted in heavyweights including Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc cutting payouts.

British equities were downgraded to underweight last week by Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ). strategists, who said the market’s dividend base remained highly concentrated, with over a quarter of the payouts coming from the “at-risk” energy sector.

The U.K. remains the most unloved region for fund managers, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ).’s June fund manager survey, which showed a net 29% as underweight. That said, allocation to U.K. equities increased by 4 percentage points this month, the survey showed, while staying well below the long-term average.

Positioning on the U.K. market could also largely depend on sterling moves, which are likely to be driven by the Brexit outcome. Rising risks of no deal could add pressure on the currency. And while the FTSE 100 has long moved in opposition to the pound, the two asset classes are currently experiencing their longest period of positive correlation since 2014.

The base case for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ). economists is that the EU and the U.K. will strike a “thin” free trade agreement by the end of the year.

The deadline for an extension request is at the end of June, and the government already stated it will not ask for another delay. That leaves until Nov. 26 to reach an agreement with the EU in a manner that will leave enough time to ratify a deal before the end of the transition period on Dec. 30.

While the EU is leading the fiscal stimulus effort, the U.K. has also been active and more could be on the cards, especially after investors expressed concerns over the Bank of England’s slowdown in asset purchases. Signs of economic recovery have also materialized after manufacturing and services data on Tuesday beat expectations, and the Citi Economic Surprise Index bounced.

FTSE 100: These shares look cheap to me! I’d buy them {{0|now}}

The volatility seen in the market in the past few months has opened up one of the best opportunities to buy shares that we have seen in a while. With some stock prices trading at recent lows, I believe it is now possible to buy shares in great companies at a wonderful price.

Although I believe the FTSE 100 will recover in the long term, it is wise for investors to exercise caution. The global economic landscape is likely to get ugly and it could mean disaster for some businesses. As Warren Buffett advises investors: “Don’t lose money!”

That said, I think these shares could be great long-term bets for FTSE 100 investors.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) In the past, Royal Dutch Shell (LSE: RDSA) was much loved by income investors. However, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic and a tumbling oil price, the company slashed its interim dividend from $0.47 to $0.16 per share. Like other FTSE 100 companies, it also cancelled its share buyback program.

Oil prices have strengthened over the past month. is now trading at just under $40 a barrel. At the start of May, its price was hovering around $30 a barrel. Demand for oil will probably increase, as governments around the world ease lockdowns and travel restrictions. If demand does surge, it is likely the price of oil will rise. If this occurs, there will be serious pressure for Shell to reinstate its dividend and resume its share buyback program.

A rising oil price is just a short-term fix for Shell. The business will eventually need to diversify away from fossil fuels and shift its revenue focus to renewables. Shell has a target of being a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 or sooner.

For now though, after falling by 40% year-to-date, I believe the Royal Dutch Shell share price is trading at a bargain level. Its price-to-earnings ratio is currently trading at just over 8. The opportunity to buy cheap shares in a quality FTSE 100 company does not happen often. It might be worth buying right now.

The best FTSE 100 share to buy? Prudential (LSE: LON: ) also makes my list of best FTSE 100 shares to buy now.

Asia and the US are Prudential’s biggest markets after the split of its UK business last year. Due to the coronavirus, the life insurer announced in May that annual premium equivalent sales in Asia were down 24% in the first quarter.

It is not all bad news for Prudential, however. Outside of Hong Kong and China, sales in the region were up by 1%. In the US, annual premium equivalent sales were up by 25%, and in Africa, annual premium equivalent sales increased by 43%.

Asia remains a difficult territory for businesses, with the threat of an escalation of the US-China trade war always in the background. However, as fellow-Fool Royston Wild points out, the key to buying shares is holding them for at least 10 years. By utilising this strategy, economic wobbles should be minimised.

Prudential’s share price has fallen by almost 17% year-to-date. This drop makes its price-to-earnings ratio just 9. And unlike other FTSE 100 companies, Prudential has maintained its announced dividend payments. The shares have a prospective dividend yield of roughly 3%.

I think Prudential is in a great position for any market recovery. I would buy and hold right now.

Is it worth buying BP and easyJet shares {{0|now}} that they’re cheap?

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio EZJ -1.51% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio FTMC -0.21% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

The March stock market crash still means the and are lower than they were at the start of the year. Does that mean that, even with the more recent recovery, there are still cheap shares out there for savvy long-term investors to buy, hold and profit from?

Perhaps. One company that will be on many investors’ radar is oil major BP (LSE: LON: ). Its share price has fallen heavily.

The peril of BP’s cheap shares Analysts are warning that BP may have to cut its dividend. That’s hardly surprising given that its peer Shell (LON: ) has already taken that move.

Adding to the bleak picture is the possibility of massive writedowns and the falling oil price. Debt has also been rising over the last two years. There can be little doubt in my mind that investing in these cheap shares is a risk and would likely be a rollercoaster ride.

Yet from an income perspective I think that even if the dividend is reset – maybe a third lower – there would still be a high dividend yield. So it could be one to consider for income investors. I’d suggest though it would be better to buy after an official announcement of a dividend cut – assuming of course that’s what management does. Then the picture will then be much clearer.

Overall, I’m not keen on these particular cheap shares, despite the price having fallen by over 33% so far this year. And despite it having a dividend yield (for now) of over 10%. The shares seem speculative and the long-term structural decline if the industry means I don’t see huge growth from the share price.

easyJet (LON: ) share price tumbled So are there any better cheap shares among the crash’s big fallers? Shares in easyJet (LSE: EZJ) have fallen even further than BP’s. The share price is down 44% during 2020 so far. Obviously coronavirus is the biggest driver of the fall.

Airlines have been battered by the pandemic and look to many to be on the ropes. But I feel they face fewer structural problems than the oil producers. Pre-coronavirus the picture looked decent with air travel expected to grow strongly. That’s now changed for a while, hence the lower share price.

Overall, easyJet has a strong brand, a large presence in budget travel and strong sales distribution channels. How often do you end up travelling on easyJet just because it’s the cheapest option?

The arguments with founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou at the board level over the purchasing of more aircraft have been a distraction. An unwelcome one I’d imagine for most existing investors, especially at a difficult time for the company.

However, I expect easyJet to make it through this crisis and in the coming years for air travel, to get back to operating in a more normal environment. I think once that happens, the share price will substantially recover and potentially have a lot of upside from where it currently is. It’ll require patience though.

In my view however, I think the shares look cheap and are worth buying. I may even add some of these cheap shares to a SIPP and tuck them away for a few years.

These are the dogs of the FTSE 100 during lockdown. I’d buy one of them today!

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ORCL -0.07% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HSBA -1.33% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LLOY -0.41% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio RR +0.13% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio STAN -0.97% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BT -0.71% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

As I write, it’s been exactly three months since the government placed the nation in lockdown to control the coronavirus pandemic. Monday, 23 March was also when the hit its 2019–20 low.

Individuals, businesses and other organisations endured huge hardships in order to “Stay Home, Protect the NHS and Save Lives” (as the government slogan urged us). Three months of economic austerity has shattered corporate profitability and sent unemployment soaring.

The FTSE 100 is down a sixth in 2020 Obviously, a global pandemic that has taken almost half a million lives will damage company earnings and valuations. Hence, the FTSE 100 index is down a sixth (16.9%) in 2020, but this comes after a steep rebound since 23 March. At its lowest ebb, the FTSE 100 was down twice as much, collapsing by a third (34.3%) in less than three months.

A rising tide doesn’t lift all boats The FTSE 100 has staged a strong comeback, rising more than a quarter (26.5%) since late March. Even so, this still leaves the index down almost 1,300 points in 2020. Ouch.

Of course, when markets fall and rise, not all shares swing to the same degree. Financially resilient firms have had their shares move in modest ranges, while endangered businesses have seen their stocks oscillate wildly (as The Smiths sang).

These are the FTSE 100’s ‘lockdown dogs’ As markets crash and rally, they produce widely dispersed winners and losers. To illustrate this point, these seven FTSE 100 shares have actually fallen since 23 March to today:

HSBC Holdings (LON: ) -26.0%

BT Group (LON: ) -9.4%

Rolls Royce (LON: ) Holdings -8.8%

Lloyds Banking Group (LON: ) -5.9%

Standard Chartered (LON: ) -5.0%

Land Securities Group -1.3%

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) -0.8%

As you can see, of these seven FTSE 100 shares that have fallen in value, three are banks. That’s hardly surprising, as loan losses and defaults will soar this year. Likewise, real-estate firm Land Securities is heavily exposed to falling values of UK commercial property.

Of the remaining three, BT Group is in an endless struggle, with its share price collapsing by nearly three-quarters (74%) over the past five years. Rolls Royce’s fortunes are mostly tied to the ailing airline industry, while Shell’s shares collapsed with the oil price.

Which FTSE 100 faller would I buy? Having come from a working-class background in the North East, I love a bargain. I also love the wisdom of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who argues, “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price”.

Following the Oracle (NYSE: ) of Omaha’s advice, I could easily see myself buying shares in oil supermajor Shell and even beaten-down UK retail bank Lloyds. But for me, the stand-out bargain among these FTSE 100 stocks is the worst performer: Asia-focused global mega-bank HSBC (LSE: HSBA).

I already argued that HSBC shares were a buy at 423p earlier this month, just before the market had its latest spasm. Priced to sell at 387p, they are now 8.5% cheaper, making them even more of a bargain-bucket buy. Indeed, they are just 17p above the low of 370p hit on 29 May.

In summary, FTSE 100 colossus HSBC’s shares are trading at levels rarely seen this millennium and in line with those seen during the global financial crisis. Eventually, HSBC should bounce back and again start paying out billions in cash dividends. For this long-term income stream and as a value bet, I’d happily buy HSBC shares today.

(Bloomberg) -- Almost a third of U.S. shale producers are technically insolvent with crude at $35 a barrel, according to Deloitte LLP, highlighting the industry’s acute financial strain even as oil prices rebound from a record low earlier this year.

West Texas Intermediate edged up to $40.06 a barrel at 11:38 a.m. in New York, a substantially higher level compared with most of the last few months, especially April, when prices briefly went negative. But the rebound will do little to prevent 15 years of debt-fueled production growth catching up with many shale producers, Deloitte said in a study. Technical insolvency is an accounting way of saying a company will face problems meeting debt repayments.

“New and unforeseen headwinds continue to jolt the industry’s progress,” authors Duane Dickson, Kate Hardin and Anshu Mittal said in the report. “Although the sub-zero price was a temporary dislocation, this intense volatility highlights the fragile state of the industry.”

Shale was just getting on a more solid footing and learning to live with $50 a barrel oil before the Covid-19 pandemic ripped through global crude demand causing prices to plunge. Now, shale producers may be forced to write down their assets by $300 billion this year, Deloitte said. That’s equivalent to the entire market value of Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, the world’s No. 2 and 3 major oil companies.

While the writedowns are non-cash items, they reduce the value of a company’s equity and increase their debt-to-equity ratios, a key measure of indebtedness used by lenders. The shale industry’s leverage ratio would increase to 54% from 40% with the writedowns.

That “can trigger many negative sequences of events, including bankruptcy,” Deloitte said.

Shale producers’ financial problems stem from a decade’s worth of huge production growth using new fracking technologies funded by massive borrowing and financing from Wall Street.

The production boom propelled the U.S. to become the world’s largest producer of both oil and gas. But in doing so, companies burned through some $342 billion of cash since 2010, leaving little in the way of returns for investors.

Chisholm Oil & Gas and Extraction Oil & Gas Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection last week, joining others including Whiting Petroleum (NYSE: ) Corp. and Ultra Petroleum Corp. Meanwhile, Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE: ). and California Resources (NYSE: ) Corp. have warned investors they’re at risk of failing to meet debt obligations.

Technical insolvency means a company’s discounted future value at a certain oil price is lower than their net liabilities. Whether or not a company actually files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy depends on breathing room and new credit provided by lenders.

Dividend investing has become a whole lot harder in recent months. As a result of the economic uncertainty associated with the coronavirus, over 40 companies in the have cancelled or suspended their dividends. Many others, including income stalwart Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), have reduced their payouts significantly.

There are, however, a number of companies that have maintained, or even increased, their dividends in 2020. With that in mind, here’s a look at 15 FTSE 100 companies that haven’t made cuts this year.

Consumer Defensive stocks The Consumer Defensive sector (which includes consumer goods companies, alcoholic beverage companies, tobacco companies, and supermarkets) is always a good place to start when it comes to reliable dividends. That’s because they tend to generate relatively steady earnings throughout the economic cycle.

Some FTSE 100 companies in this area include consumer goods champions Unilever (LON: ) (trailing yield: 3.1%) and Reckitt Benckiser (2.4%), alcoholic beverage giant Diageo (LON: ) (2.4%), tobacco legend British American Tobacco (LON: ) (6.4%), and supermarket Tesco (LON: ) (4%).

Healthcare stocks Healthcare stocks also tend to be pretty reliable dividend payers. That’s because demand for healthcare tends to remain relatively steady. People still need medication during a recession.

The Healthcare sector hasn’t disappointed in the current crisis. As it stands, all the major healthcare stocks in the FTSE 100, including AstraZeneca (2.7%), GlaxoSmithKline (4.8%), Smith & Nephew (LON: ) (2%), and Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LON: ) (1.5%), have either maintained or increased their dividend payouts.

Financial stocks Financial stocks aren’t always the most reliable dividend payers. That’s because their earnings tend to fluctuate when stock markets fluctuate, or during periods of economic turbulence. This year, a number of well-known FTSE 100 financial stocks, including the likes of Lloyds Bank, Barclays (LON: ), and Aviva (LON: ) have suspended or cancelled their dividends (the UK banks were actually forced to suspend their dividends by the Bank of England).

However, there are a handful of FTSE 100 financial companies that have maintained their payouts in the current crisis. Companies in this area of the market that haven’t cut their payouts, so far, include insurers Legal & General Group (LON: ) (8%) and Prudential (LON: ) (3.3%), and online broker Hargreaves Lansdown (LON: ) (2%).

Other FTSE 100 dividend payers Finally, there are a handful of stocks in other areas of the market that haven’t cut their dividends. For example, in the Utilities sector, there’s National Grid (LON: ) (5%). It recently lifted its dividend by 2.6%. In the Chemicals sector, Croda is still paying its dividend (1.7%). And in the Technology sector, Sage has maintained its dividend (2.4%).

Picking the best dividend stocks Looking at this list of stocks, a couple of takeaways spring to mind. Firstly, some sectors appear to be better than others when it comes to reliable dividends. Consumer Defensive and Healthcare, in particular, stand out when it comes to dividends.

Secondly, the majority of these dividend stocks have lower yields. Whereas many FTSE 100 companies that had yields of 6%+ have cut their dividends, many that have yields of between 2% to 4% have maintained their payouts.

If you’re looking for reliable dividends, this kind of yield bracket could be your best bet.

3 shares I’d buy {{0|now}} for a 2020 stock market recovery

Many share prices have started climbing back after their Covid-19 crashes, and plenty still have that to come. Here are three I think could emerge strongly from a 2020 stock market recovery.

My first pick is Gulf Keystone Petroleum (LSE: GKP), whose share price is down 55% since the start of the year. But it has been worse – it was down 75% at one stage. The price of oil is obviously a big factor, with a barrel briefly plunging below $20 at its lowest. We’re looking at twice that figure now, at around $40 per barrel. That’s still not as high as the $60–$70 levels of the early part of the year, but it’s moving in the right direction, along with the stock market recovery.

You might prefer the big oil companies, like BP (LON: ) and Shell (LON: ), for more safety. But I think Gulf Keystone is far safer than many small competitors, for two main reasons. One is that it’s been profitable for years, though there is a loss forecast for 2020.

The other is that Gulf Keystone carries no debt. It returned nearly $100m to shareholders in 2019, and had $164m in cash on the books at 22 April. I see strong upside potential for Gulf Keystone, and only limited downside.

Doors opening soon My second pick is Greggs (LSE: GRG), whose shops have been closed throughout the lockdown. Despite that, the Greggs share price hasn’t been as badly hammered as you might fear. And there’s already been room for Greggs in the stock market recovery so far. Greggs shares now stand 22% down year-to-date, a little worse than the 100’s 17%. At their lowest, they were 47% down, but we’ve seen a 40% gain since then.

Greggs has announced cautions plans for its return to opening up its shops. The company’s phased reopening should see all of its stores with the doors open by early July.

Greggs is financially secure, and has been a good dividend payer for years. What might happen this year is still open. But I can see the stock’s attraction for dividend investors continuing over the long term. If you’d managed to bag some Greggs shares at the bottom of the market, I think you’d have locked in a very solid income stream. But it’s not too late, and Greggs shares are a buy for me at current prices.

Biggest stock market recovery? Cineworld Group (LSE: LON: ) has seen its share price crash 64% so far this year. Things have been much worse, though, with an early 90% fall by mid-March. But the stock market recovery hasn’t been as kind to Cineworld so far.

Now, if Cineworld is the hardest hit, I think it’s also the riskiest of the three here. As my Motley Fool colleague T Sligo has pointed out, Cineworld carries a lot of debt. And that really will take some sorting out over the next few years. Some fear for the future of the cinema business in general, facing the onslaught of online streaming services. But cinema audiences have been robust in recent years. And I think responding to an easing of lockdown won’t be as hard as some might fear.

I’d say Cineworld is not a pick for those looking for safety. But I do see potential upside for those prepared to risk a modest sum.

Are BP shares the biggest bargain on the market today?

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LCO -0.15% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio CL -0.17% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Over the last two weeks, BP (LSE: LON: ) shares have fallen by around 15%. This has left them trading at the same price as in 2010 after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In this event, the BP share price was able to recover quickly. This would indicate that it is too cheap at the moment. But with problems currently abounding in the oil industry, will the shares manage to stage a similar recovery?

Would I buy BP shares for its dividend? At the moment, BP is one of the largest dividend payers in the , with a yield of over 10%. While this does sound very tempting, the dividend is also unsustainable. After Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) cut its dividend a couple of months ago, I now believe that a BP dividend cut is imminent. Firstly, the firm is riddled with debt, and has not taken any large steps to reduce this. Its debt currently stands at around $51bn. With the dividend currently costing BP around $8bn a year, it seems sensible, therefore, that some of this money should be used to pay off the debt.

In addition, the company has recently announced that it will slash $17.5bn off the value of its oil and gas assets. This came after its long-term price assumption was reduced from $75 a barrel to $55. This move means that BP shares are trading at a higher price-to-book ratio and its shareholders’ equity is greatly reduced. Once again, it seems evident that a dividend cut is required.

Is it time to go green? Another reason why BP has slashed the value of its assets is because of the global shift towards greener energy. Currently, its spending on renewable energy amounts to only $500m. Seeing as this is very much the future, the recent plunge in prices should encourage it to increase its exposure to greener energy. But this leads to its own problems. Firstly, various renewable energy companies dominate the market at present. Consequently, it will not be easy for BP to make its own transition. Furthermore, the short-term effect of increased investment in renewables would be to increase its debt-to-equity ratio. With debt levels already excessive, this could place further strain on the shares.

Would I buy or sell BP shares? Throughout this article, I have portrayed a rather gloomy outlook for BP. While I maintain that the short-term future does not look bright, I also believe that this has been priced into the current price. As a result, I cannot see the BP share price sinking significantly lower, even if it does decide to cut its dividend. But I also cannot see a significant recovery until the oil giant is able to both fortify its balance sheet and make the necessary transition into greener energy. As I can’t see this happening any time soon, I’m staying away from BP shares for the moment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors managing £1.8 trillion in assets are widening a campaign pressing oil majors to better reflect climate risks in their accounting, and will soon target other businesses with heavy fossil fuel exposure, the group said on Monday.

The investors believe their campaign is working, noting the ""hugely important"" news of BP (L: ) joining other oil majors in lowering the value of its assets amid a global transition to cleaner energy, said Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at asset manager Sarasin & Partners.

""The question all company directors and their shareholders now need urgently answered is, 'Where else might company positions be overstated?'"" the group of more than 20 leading funds said in a joint statement seen by Reuters.

BP declined to comment on the campaign.

The investor group can't be certain whether its efforts played into BP's decision to reduce the value of its assets by up to $17.5 billion, announced on June 15.

But they have already begun lobbying building materials company CRH (I: ) and plan to write to Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto (L: ) (AX: ), which supplies the steel industry. Along with cement, steel is a major source of greenhouse gases.

""We will be rolling out similar engagements with other fossil fuel-dependent companies,"" Landell-Mills, who is coordinating the campaign, told Reuters in an interview.

The investors were also planning to include European and U.S. banks financing fossil fuel projects, Landell-Mills added.

Rio Tinto and CRH declined to comment.

Early last year, the investors began lobbying the Big Four accounting firms - EY, Deloitte, PwC and KPMG - to do more to ensure climate-related risks are adequately reflected in company financial statements they audit.

The campaign is one of a number of efforts by investors to push companies on environmental policies, amid concerns many businesses are both contributing to the planet's warming while also failing to take full stock of the risks they face.

Major fund managers including BlackRock (N: ) have issued increasingly strident public statements about climate change, while other investors have threatened to pull money out of Brazil unless Amazon (NASDAQ: ) deforestation is curbed.

The campaign led by Sarasin & Partners emphasizes the legal duty companies have to ensure their financial statements fully reflect how government moves to ratchet up climate action and the falling costs of renewable energy are likely to affect future profitability.

""It's a very serious thing from their perspective,"" said Landell-Mills. ""This is a matter of ensuring there is no misrepresentation going on.""

Accounting for potential future losses can weaken a company's balance sheet, making it harder to finance new investment in carbon-intensive activities such as oil exploration, the investors argue.

The coalition includes Sarasin & Partners, M&G Investments, Jupiter Asset Management, NN Investment Partners and pension funds such as the Brunel Pension Partnership and Denmark's PKA.

""POTENTIALLY OVERSTATING""

Although it was difficult to independently assess the impact of the campaign, Landell-Mills pointed to a series of moves that align with the investors' demands in letters https://sarasinandpartners.com/stewardship-post/paris-aligned-accounting-is-vital-to-deliver-climate-promises sent to BP, Anglo-Dutch major Shell (L: ) and France's Total (PA: ) in November.

In the letters, seen by Reuters, the investors questioned whether the companies' oil price assumptions, which form the bedrock of their accounts, were aligned with the 2015 Paris climate accord, which implies sharp cuts in fossil fuel use.

Before BP's writedown, the group's letter to the British oil major said: ""We have concerns that, at present, BP's accounts may be overlooking material climate considerations, and consequently potentially overstating both performance and capital."" The same language was used with Shell and Total.

Total did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. Shell said it had ""comprehensively responded"" to similar demands by the investor group, and included climate risks in its accounts.

""Since that time, Shell has also published an ambition to be a net zero energy company by 2050, or sooner,"" Shell said in an email to Reuters on Sunday.

Last week, BP cut its benchmark Brent oil price forecasts to an average of $55 a barrel until 2050, from $70, saying it expects a collapse in oil demand during the coronavirus pandemic to accelerate a low-carbon transition.

BP also said it would have to review some plans for early stage oil and gas exploration projects.

Meanwhile, Shell also lowered its long-term expectations to $60 a barrel, from the 2018 price of $70, in its 2019 annual report published in March. Total also reduced its price assumptions at about the same time.

While majors often adjust price assumptions, the investors noted that Shell's auditor's report contained substantially more references to climate risks than the previous year.

""It's tip of the iceberg,"" Landell-Mills said. ""And investors will have to understand that they (oil majors) are not going to be able to pay dividends like they did before.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusive-after-bp-takes-a-hit-investors-widen-climate-change-campaign-2145960,0.072,0.868,0.061,-0.9443

(Reuters) - London shares rose on Friday as a sharp rebound in retail sales in May bolstered hopes of a swift economic recovery from a pandemic-driven slump, while energy shares tracked a gain in oil prices.

The FTSE 100 ( ) was up 0.5% and on course to rise for the fourth week in five as optimism around the revival in business activity overshadowed concerns of further lockdowns following a surge in infections in the United States and China.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) added 0.1%, with auto ( ), banking ( ) and food and beverage ( ) stocks leading gains.

Data on Friday showed retail sales volumes surged by a record 12% in May amid an easing in the nationwide shutdown imposed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.

""The retail sales numbers show the economy isn't dead, which is giving some confidence to the market,"" said Andrea Cicione, strategist at TS Lombard.

""Investors are now positioning themselves for the upcoming second-quarter numbers and also keeping an eye on any significant jump in coronavirus cases globally.""

UK stock markets have joined a global rally following a coronavirus-driven crash in March, with the FTSE 100 now less than 20% below its record high, partly aided by historic stimulus.

The Bank of England on Thursday expanded its bond-buying plan, as expected, but slowed the pace of the programme, saying it saw some signs of an economic recovery. A separate survey on Friday showed consumer sentiment recorded its biggest improvement in nearly four years in June.

Among individual stocks, BP Plc (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) were among the biggest boosts to the FTSE 100 as oil prices rose on a pledge by OPEC and allies to meet their supply cut commitments.

But engineering and consultancy company Wood Group Plc (L: ) fell 3.6% after saying it expected first-half core earnings to drop 19%.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/london-stocks-gain-on-sharp-rebound-in-may-retail-sales-oil-boost-2144850,0.021,0.89,0.089,0.9591

Looking for dividends? Here are 2 FTSE 100 income stocks I’d buy today

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LLOY -0.41% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio AV -0.90% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ULVR -0.47% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BT -0.71% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Covid-19 has changed the game for UK dividend investors. Over the last few months, over 40 companies in the , including the likes of BT Group (LON: ), Aviva (LON: ), and Lloyds Bank, have suspended or cancelled their dividend payouts. Meanwhile, plenty of other FTSE companies, including Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), have reduced their payouts significantly.

There are a number of high-quality FTSE 100 companies, however, that haven’t cut their dividends in the recent crisis. These are the companies I would focus on if I was building an income portfolio today. Here’s a look at two such companies.

A top FTSE 100 dividend stock The first FTSE 100 dividend stock I want to highlight is Unilever (LSE: LON: ). It’s a leading consumer goods company that owns a world class portfolio of trusted brands including Dove, Domestos, and Ben & Jerry’s.

The reason I like Unilever is that demand for its products tends to be steady throughout the economic cycle. Even in a recession, people still buy soap, deodorant, and household cleaners. This has implications for the dividend. Because Unilever’s earnings and cash flows are relatively consistent, the company is able to pay out a steady stream of dividends to its investors.

Unilever has a fantastic dividend track record. It hasn’t cut its payout for at least 30 years. This puts it in an elite group of dividend payers. Recently, the company advised that it was maintaining its quarterly dividend at €0.4104 per share. That equates to an annualised yield of about 3.3% at the current share price.

Unilever is not the cheapest stock in the FTSE 100. Currently, the forward-looking P/E ratio is about 21. I think that’s a price worth paying, however. This is a high-quality dividend payer with an excellent track record.

Well positioned in a post-Covid-19 world Another FTSE 100 consumer goods company I’d buy for income is Reckitt Benckiser (LSE: RB). It’s a global leader in health and hygiene and sports a top portfolio of brands including Nurofen, Mucinex, Dettol, and Lysol.

I think RB shares look particularly attractive in the current environment. In a post-Covid-19 world, I see a lot more focus on hygiene. Reckitt’s products, such as Dettol antibacterial wipes and Lysol disinfectant spray, should be in high demand for a while. Recent first-quarter results were certainly encouraging. For the period, hygiene sales were up 12.8%. I’ll point out that I’m not the only one who is bullish on Reckitt. In recent months, a number of top-level insiders have been loading up on RB shares, which suggests they are confident about the future too.

Like Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser has an excellent dividend track record. Since the FTSE 100 company was formed in 1999, it has never cut its dividend. In that time, it has also lifted its payout from 24p per share to 175p per share. That kind of consistent track record and long-term growth in the payout is exactly what you want to see as a dividend investor.

RB shares currently trade on a forward-looking P/E ratio of 23.6 and offer a prospective yield of just under 2.5%. A little expensive? Sure. But totally worth the price tag, in my view.

Shell’s share price has fallen by 40%. Is it time to buy?

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Six short months ago, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) was the 100’s largest company. That place has now been taken by pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca, and the Shell share price is down by 40%.

Oil companies are out of fashion with investors. But although there are many arguments against these fossil fuel producers at the moment, I think it’s too soon to write them off. Here, I’ll explain why I see Shell as a contrarian buy and have topped up my holding since the market crash.

Why has Shell’s share price collapsed? Shell faces a tough combination of short- and long-term problems at the moment. Right now, the company is battling with a slump in oil demand that’s been triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

Looking further ahead, the oil industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Shell has made big promises to slash emissions and is aiming to become the world’s biggest electricity company by the 2030s. But the details of how this will be achieved are still very uncertain.

Even if Shell does succeed, we don’t yet know if the company will be able to maintain its current size and profitability in a greener world.

It’s a tough set of problems for CEO Ben van Beurden to solve. But he does have a few tricks up his sleeve which make me believe that Shell’s share price should rise again.

Don’t forget the big picture I believe the world needs to address climate change urgently. But the reality is that billions of people all over the world still rely on fossil fuels for transportation, electricity, and the raw materials needed in manufacturing.

Despite this year’s oil price crash and demand slump, Shell is still expected to generate revenues of $236bn in 2020. The group’s profits are expected to drop to $3.3bn, but should recover to $9.5bn in 2021. That gives Shell shares a 2021 forecast price/earnings ratio of 12, which looks reasonable to me.

I’m pretty sure demand for oil and gas won’t disappear overnight. It’s also worth remembering Shell does a lot more than just pump oil and gas out of the ground.

The Anglo-Dutch group owns refineries, chemical plants, distribution networks and is a world-class energy trader. I believe many of these engineering and infrastructure assets will remain relevant in an electrified future, especially if LPG or hydrogen become more widely used as transport fuels.

Dividend cut should could help Shell shares Shell’s share price fell when the group cut its dividend by 65% in April. It was a shock — the first cut by the company since the Second World War. But I’m certain it was the right thing to do.

The group’s $14bn annual dividend had become a burden which limited its ability to change and evolve. This isn’t right. Dividends should be paid from spare cash, when a business is operating as well as possible.

This cut will hit shareholders’ income this year (including mine), but I think we’ll benefit over the longer term. With the shares trading at around 1,300p and offering a yield of about 4%, I rate Shell as a long-term energy buy.

These FTSE 100 stocks HAVEN’T cut dividends! Here’s why I think they’ll slash payouts soon

These are worrying times for income investors. The threat of an economic downturn that could dwarf the Great Recession is spooking even the biggest and most financially-secure companies. As a consequence, even companies that haven’t already been badly damaged by the Covid-19 crisis are cutting dividends.

A number of British blue chips have pledged to keep on paying dividends despite the tough economic outlook. But it’s likely that more FTSE 100 firms will be added to the list of dividend axers, suspenders, or reducers as 2020 progresses. What can investors expect the following Footsie plays to do in the weeks and months ahead?

10% dividend yields! BP’s become a lightning rod for speculation over where the next FTSE 100 dividend cut will come from. A chorus is growing among City analysts that the oilie’s about to pull the trigger following the crude price crash. Cash flows and profits have dived while its colossal debt pile is swelling. It already has a monster $50bn-plus of net debt to service.

In anticipation of a prolonged downturn in oil demand, BP (LON: ) this month announced plans to cut 10,000 roles from its global workforce. It’s the first in what will be many steps to save cash, one of which I’m sure will include slashing dividends. And sooner rather than later, too. This is why I care not for the company’s near-10% yield. It’s a matter of time before BP follows its FTSE 100 rival Shell (LON: ) in reducing shareholder payouts.

Under pressure FTSE 100 stocks BP isn’t the only Footsie share that investors need to be careful with, however. Pearson has kept its previous dividend pledges but I think it’s only a matter of time before the educational materials supplier bites the bullet. Major structural issues, like falling student enrolments and the rise of free education tools, mean that revenues keep falling. Debt here, meanwhile, continues to climb too.

Those fundamental problems in its markets would discourage me from buying Pearson and its 3%-plus dividend yield. I’d be much happier to buy shares in The Berkeley Group, a FTSE 100 housebuilder that should benefit in the coming years from London’s huge homes shortage. I wouldn’t buy it on account of its near-term dividend outlook, though.

Current payout forecasts create a massive 6% dividend yield, but I reckon Berkeley could disappoint big time. Toughening economic conditions that could smack homebuyer demand in 2020 and 2021 are one thing. Lenders making the process unaffordable for many potential buyers by hiking deposit requirements threatens to hit sales of Berkeley’s products, too.

FTSE 100 rivals Taylor Wimpey (LON: ), Persimmon (LON: ), and Barratt have all reined in their dividend plans following the Covid-19 crisis. And it’s a matter of time before Berkeley follows suit, in my opinion. Income investors need to be extremely careful in the current macroeconomic climate, clearly. But they don’t need to panic. There remains a multitude of great Footsie dividend shares to snap up today.

NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico will have to pay more for less coverage under its giant oil revenue insurance policy for 2021, but will likely go ahead anyway to avoid further damaging its financial standing with international investors, sources said.

The finance ministry's billion-dollar oil hedge is the world's largest. It has been a pillar of the budget for more than two decades for Mexico, which pumps about 1.7 million barrels per day of crude.

The policy ensures Mexico can sell oil at a predetermined price, guaranteeing a portion of revenues crucial for the state budget - no matter what happens in the global oil market.

Many countries dependent on oil revenues face massive budget shortfalls due to collapsing prices and demand during the coronavirus pandemic, yet Mexico's insurance policy is expected to deliver a $6 billion payout this year - its largest ever.

Bankers and officials on both sides of the secretive deal expect a smaller hedge this year since market volatility and lower crude prices have sharply hiked the cost of options Mexico typically uses to hedge oil sales. Those oil derivatives for 2021 are 40% more expensive than normal, several market sources said.

At the same time, resources available to finance the hedge are dwindling. Despite the bumper hedge payout, lower revenues have forced Mexico's government to plug the gap by spending more of the stabilization fund that also pays for the hedge.

""There are lots of challenges, and everything points to it being more difficult,"" said a Mexican source who worked on last year's hedge.

Finance ministry sources said internal discussions center on either hedging a smaller part of the country's exports in 2021; buying cheaper options; or using a less costly strategy.

Negotiations with banks on the hedge have yet to start, ministry and Wall Street sources said.

The hedge is designed to protect about one-fifth of Mexico's budget revenues, current and former Mexican finance and energy ministry officials said.

The finance ministry, energy ministry and the president's office did not reply to requests for comment. The government has grown more secretive about its strategy so other traders cannot easily profit from speculating on its giant options purchases with bets that can in turn make the hedge more expensive. [nL1N28C1XM]

Finance Minister Arturo Herrera is a strong proponent of the hedge and likely to keep it, said several Mexican sources familiar with his thinking.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (N: ), Citigroup Inc (N: ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (N: ), BNP Paribas SA (PA: ) and Shell (L: ) are among those the finance ministry tapped to execute the hedge last year, sources familiar with the deal said. [nL2N278035]

Investors and credit rating agencies consider the hedge a measure of fiscal prudence that offsets oil market volatility. Scrapping it might prompt some bond investors to demand higher yields. [nL1N2DJ00Y]

If Mexico's borrowing costs rise, it could also mean even higher financing costs for ailing state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], already a junk-rated company. [nL1N2D32OK]

Mexico is still rated investment grade, but all three major credit rating agencies - Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings - downgraded the country this year, and could lower its rating in coming months.

""The hedge insures federal revenues,"" said Luis Gonzali, a portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton, one of the world's top investors in emerging markets.

""Not having this insurance would put pressure on the country's finances, investor confidence and eventually the credit rating.""

Mexico estimates its main Maya crude export will average $30 per barrel in the coming year. Brent crude ( ) is expected to average about $46 in 2021, according to Reuters polling. As of Friday, Brent was trading at $38 a barrel, while Maya bound for the U.S. Gulf Coast traded at $33.37 on Thursday, according to S&P Global Platts.

MORE EXPENSIVE

Mexico typically hedges in a straightforward way: it purchases put options, which give the holder the right but not the obligation to sell at a predetermined price.

The options have been trading at higher prices due to market volatility, the main driver of those prices. With coronavirus lockdowns slamming demand in April, oil prices plunged to multi-year lows. actually fell into negative territory for the first time in history.

Mexico may try to save cash by buying put options at a lower level - known as a strike price. That would cost less, but such a hedge would only pay out if oil was at lower level.

In the past, when oil prices were lower, Mexico has hedged fewer barrels to offset the higher cost, said one banker who has negotiated with Mexican officials in the past.

""Without a doubt, the hedge for the coming year, if it's done, will carry much higher premiums,"" a source in the finance ministry said.

""In this market, it'll be complicated for the Mexican government.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/exclusive--mexicos-oil-hedge-to-be-pricier-but-government-likely-doing-it-anyway-2141034,0.086,0.872,0.042,-0.9898

BP shares: I expect a dividend cut in 2020

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LCO -0.15% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

BP (LSE: LON: ) is currently one of the highest-yielding shares in the . Last year, the oil major paid out total dividends of 41 cents per share. At the current share price, that equates to a trailing dividend yield of more than 10%.

Is this high yield sustainable though? I’m not convinced it is. Here, I’ll explain why I think it’s highly likely that BP will cut its dividend in 2020.

BP shares: a dividend cut on the horizon? BP currently faces two major challenges that could impact its ability to continue to pay its current level of dividends to investors.

First, there’s oil prices, which have crashed in 2020 due to Covid-19. prices started the year around the $65 per barrel mark. Today, stand at around $40 per barrel. This is well below the level the oil majors would like.

This decline in oil prices is likely to hit BP’s cash flows and profits hard in the near term. Earlier this week, the FTSE 100 company said it’s expecting to post second-quarter, post-tax, non-cash impairment charges and write-offs of between $13bn and $17.5bn. That’s its biggest writedown since the Macondo oil spill a decade ago. This drop in profitability is likely to have negative implications for the dividend.

On top of this, there are longer-term challenges associated with the shift towards renewable energy. BP is taking the shift seriously. It plans to eliminate the carbon footprint of the oil and gas it produces to ‘net zero’ by 2050. This is an ambitious goal that’s likely to cost the company a significant amount of money. This potentially means less cash will be available for dividends.

Add in the fact that rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) recently slashed its dividend for the first time since World War II (which takes the pressure off BP in terms of the potential market reaction to a dividend cut) and I think a dividend cut in 2020 is highly likely.

Here’s what analysts are saying It appears that a wide range of analysts agree with me.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, recently said: “Having seen Shell bite the bullet and cut its dividend a few weeks ago, it would appear that BP is likely to have to follow suit, if it wants to reduce its already high debt levels and shore up its balance sheet.”

Similarly, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said earlier in the week that he thought that BP’s recent update was “softening shareholders up” for a dividend cut when the company posts its second quarter results at the beginning of August.

Meanwhile, Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Capital Markets recently predicted BP would cut its payout by 40%, stating that it was a case of “when not if,” while Redburn analyst Stuart Joyner said he is expecting BP to cut its dividend by a third.

Be prepared for a dividend cut In conclusion, if you own BP shares, I think you need to be prepared for a dividend cut in the near future. With oil prices remaining low and the company needing capital in order to shift its focus towards renewable energy, a dividend cut looks highly likely, in my view.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The number of publicly accessible charging points for electric vehicles (EV) jumped 60% in 2019, the biggest increase in three years and outpacing sales of battery-powered cars, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

In its annual Global EV Outlook, the IEA said the number of public slow and fast charging spots reached 862,118 globally, with China, the world's largest car market, taking a 60% share.

Fast chargers accounted for 31% of the total. The IEA defines slow charging as providing power of up to 22 kilowatts (kW), taking hours to charge a vehicle battery. Fast chargers, including Tesla's (O: ) superchargers, can take minutes.

""China continues to lead in the rollout of publicly accessible chargers, particularly fast chargers, which are suited to its dense urban areas with less opportunity for private charging at home,"" the report said.

(For an interactive version of the graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/azgvobxykpd/index.html?eikon=true)

The increase reflects efforts to build critical infrastructure ahead of an expected boom in EV sales, which accounted for just 1% of global car stock last year, according to the IEA.

While most EV charging takes place at home or at work, the rollout of public infrastructure is key to convincing prospective buyers that there is no risk of them getting stranded on an empty battery.

As part of its economic stimulus plan, Germany announced earlier this month that it would provide 500 million euros ($563 million) to support the rollout of private charge points, of which there are 6.5 million worldwide.

""I view this as an organic step in the right direction, but not a revolution with big winners or losers,"" said Thomas Daiber, founder of e-mobility advisory firm Cosmic Cat, of the German plan.

As well as Tesla, charge point providers include Anglo-Dutch group Shell (L: ), France's Engie (PA: ), Germany's E.ON (DE: ), Volkswagen (DE: ) and ChargePoint, whose shareholders include Daimler (DE: ), BMW (DE: ) and Siemens (DE: ).",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/charging-points-surge-ahead-of-electric-car-boom-2141085,0.015,0.925,0.06,0.9212

FTSE 100 stock market crash: I’d buy these 2 cheap UK shares to become an ISA millionaire

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LLOY -0.41% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Buying cheap shares after the UK stock market crash could be a means of generating high returns in the coming years.

The index’s track record of recovery shows that it has always been able to overcome periods of poor performance to post strong gains.

As such, now could be the right time to buy cheap shares, such as the two businesses discussed below. They may catalyse your portfolio’s performance and increase your chances of becoming an ISA millionaire.

Shell (LON: ) The difficult operating conditions facing the oil & gas sector have taken their toll on FTSE 100 stock Shell’s (LSE: RDSB) dividend. Its recent first-quarter results included a reduction in shareholder payouts of around two-thirds.

However, the company now yields around 4% due in part to its weak share price performance over the last few months. That is higher than many of its index peers, and suggests that it could continue to offer income investing appeal.

Certainly, the outlook for the company is relatively challenging. Lower demand for oil and gas could continue over the coming months as a weak economic outlook is likely to remain in place. However, with a solid balance sheet and the capacity to reduce its operating and capital expenditure, it could offer long-term recovery potential.

With investor sentiment towards the FTSE 100 energy sector being highly downbeat at the present time, now could be an opportune moment to buy high-quality businesses such as Shell while they are unpopular. Although doing so may not lead to high returns in the short run, it could produce high returns in the coming years that increase the value of your ISA.

FTSE 100 bank Lloyds Another FTSE 100 share that could produce long-term capital returns is Lloyds (LSE: LLOY). The banking sector is also very unpopular at the present time. Factors such as low interest rates and cancelled dividends for the 2020 financial year mean that investors have pivoted to other sectors over the last few months.

As such, the Lloyds share price now trades 47% lower than it did at the start of the year. This could mean that it offers a margin of safety, since investors may have priced-in many of the risks currently facing the UK economy.

The bank’s performance prior to the pandemic was relatively impressive. It has integrated acquisitions, invested in online services to differentiate itself in a competitive environment, and has successfully launched a financial planning service that could provide cross-selling opportunities over the coming years.

Therefore, as the outlook for the UK economy improves over the long run, Lloyds could be a major beneficiary. Now could be the right time to buy a slice of it while it appears to offer a wide margin of safety relative to many FTSE 100 companies.

When we come out the far end of the coronavirus crisis, the government will be burdened by a huge rise in public borrowing. So a time of austerity in public spending seems very likely. And I see that putting pressure on the State Pension.

Changes in the retirement age have already paved the way for some savings. The traditional qualifying age of 65 years is gradually rising, and is set to reach 67 by 2028. We’ve also had rumours that politicians want to lift that even further. I reckon we’ll see people having to wait until they’re 70, and maybe even older, before too many more years have passed.

State Pension triple lock The value of the State Pension could soon be eroding, too. Currently, pensions are protected by what’s known as the triple lock, but that’s coming under fire. The triple lock means the basic State Pension rises each year by 2.5%, the rate of inflation, or average earnings growth, whichever is highest. Scrapping that could save the government about £8bn a year.

What do we do about it? If there’s never been a more critical time to plan to beat the State Pension, I think there’s rarely been a time with better opportunities. I’m talking about investing in UK stock market shares, in a Stocks and Shares ISA, a SIPP, or a combination of both.

Stock market returns Over the long term, the UK stock market has provided average annual gains of 4.9% above inflation. Some years will be bad, like 2020 so far, and some years will be much better. But overall, I think it’s the best way there is to beat the State Pension. The sooner you start investing for your pension the better, and the early years really do make a big difference. And starting when the stock market is down could give you an extra boost.

I have a lot of favourite income stocks that I think are great for a pension portfolio. And they’re all cheaper now than they’ve been for years. Now, some of them have suspended their dividends due to the Covid-19 threat. That includes Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), which previously had not reduced its dividends since the end of World War II. That’s how serious it is.

Dividend recovery The banks have suspended their dividends too, at the behest of the PRA. And many others have gone into cash preservation mode. But this will pass, and dividends will surely be restored, even if they take a little while to get back to pre-crash levels.

To beat the State Pension I’d buy shares in those oil giants, banks, housebuilders, and other top stocks with long dividend track records. Energy providers, pharmaceuticals companies… there are many that I think could find a good home in your pension investment portfolio.

I’d buy cheap FTSE 100 shares in a Stocks and Shares ISA to make a million from the market crash

After crashing by 32% in the depths of the sell-off, The has recovered around 25% of its value. But an impressive rise in global stocks has now left many investors in fear of a second major sell-off. Regardless of whether another crash is around the corner, I’d continue to buy cheap FTSE 100 shares in an ISA and hold them for the long term. Why? Because I believe it’s the best way to build capital in the long run.

Cheap FTSE 100 shares are everywhere Glancing at the FTSE 100 index, one can’t help but think there’s still significant value on offer. Many well-established and reputable companies are trading far below their average historic valuations, further indicating a wide margin of safety. Think of companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), Aviva (LON: ) and Barclays (LON: ), whose share prices have all fallen by over 26%.

As always, I don’t advocate buying stocks simply because their share prices have fallen. But rather, because they’ve fallen too much. As such, these companies and many others could presently be considerably undervalued.

Moreover, some of the FTSE 100’s top dividend shares are also trading on cheap valuations thanks to the sell-off. The advantage with these stocks is that they enable you to plough dividends back into your investments, fuelling the process of compounding. I’m thinking of companies such as British American Tobacco (LON: ) and GlaxoSmithKline that boast respective yields of 6.75% and 4.9%, and P/E ratios of 9.2 and 12.9.

Investing inside a Stocks and Shares ISA The benefits of investing inside a Stocks and Shares ISA cannot be understated in my view. Once opened, you’ll receive three tax benefits, including no tax on profits, no tax on interest earned on bonds and no tax on dividend income. These taxes can have a serious impact on your portfolio once it reaches a certain amount.

You can open a Stocks and Shares ISA with numerous brokers online. It’s a simple process and can be done in a matter of minutes. Trust me, you’ll be glad you did it once you have a sizeable investment pot to your name!

How to make a million from the market crash Finally, let me illustrate just how simple it actually is to make a million in the stock market. Thanks to the unmatched power of time combined with interest, you can turn a relatively small investment into a massive one.

For example, let’s say you invest £375 a month in a mixture of shares in your ISA. Additionally, you manage to achieve an annual return of 9%. After exactly 35 years, your S&S ISA would have a value of £1,017,357!

With that in mind, don’t miss out on the opportunity to buy cheap FTSE 100 shares in an ISA today. Hold them for the long term, and you can expect to realise some serious returns that should immensely boost your prospects of making a million.

SIPP investing ideas: 3 bargain FTSE 100 shares I’d hold for 30 years

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio AAL -2.13% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio AV -0.90% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio Copper -0.26% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

If you’re looking for SIPP investing ideas, you’re in the right place. My SIPP is my ticket to a happy retirement. That’s why I treat SIPP investing differently than my Stocks and Shares ISA.

I’m going to hold these shares for 30 years. So quality is king. Add value on top, and I have myself a winning combination. Lower price-to-earnings ratios are generally better, as long as we’re talking about quality companies.

SIPP investing ideas I’d prefer to pay bargain prices for my FTSE 100 shares, if possible.

“Whether it’s stocks or socks, I prefer buying merchandise when it’s marked down,” says Warren Buffett.

So first on my list of SIPP investing ideas is Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE:RDSB). This quarter’s dividend yield has been cut for the first time since World War II. The company reported a net loss of $24m in Q1 2020 compared to a $6bn profit for the same period in 2019.

So some long-term holders have deserted the ship. But I see this a relatively short-term weakness. At these bargain basement prices I’m jumping aboard.

I’m convinced that with Shell’s gargantuan earnings power, the dividend will return.

Shell’s P/E ratio is in single figures for the first time in years. It now stands at 8.1. That’s well below the average P/E ratio of all FTSE 100 shares of 13.2, and far beneath the forecast average of 17.4.

I was annoyed to miss the P/E dip under 12 times earnings for my SIPP in late 2018. But my opportunity has finally come around again.

Mining for treasure Next up in my SIPP investing ideas is Anglo American (LSE:LON: ). It’s another blue-chip giant with a P/E ratio of 7.2. This single-digit price tag is the cheapest it has been since 2017. And yet the South African multinational miner has been recovering strongly from the Covid-induced market crash.

Quality is evident. Its sales per share have been growing strongly for the last five years, up from £10.29 per share to £18.24 in 2019. All the while AAL has been deleveraging its balance sheet, cutting its debt-to-assets ratio from 58% in 2015 to 44% last year. Return on capital and equity are both extremely strong, and its operating margin of 20% can’t be easily bettered.

It has large interests in diamond mining through its De Beers subsidiary, along with large mines in Chile and Peru. At a market cap of £24.2bn and sales of £23.7bn, there’s also value to be had here.

Take a SIPP of this The last of my SIPP investing ideas is Aviva (LON: ). I’ve long been an Aviva holder, and I’ve been pound-cost averaging into the insurer since the crash.

Want proof of its quality? When FTSE 100 shares rebounded on (perhaps undue) optimism, Aviva started flying upwards. So I’m convinced picking it up on weakness today will yield superstar compound growth in future.

Value-wise, there’s a lot to love. Sales of £70bn on a £10bn market cap is one handy figure. A price-to-book value of 0.64 is tiny given the size of the company.

At a P/E ratio of just 4.4, this is perhaps the biggest bargain of them all. It has warned of a £160m Covid-19 payout to businesses. That sounds like a lot of money. But when you consider last year’s profits were £3.9bn? A drop in the ocean. I’d buy it every day of the week if I could.

Stock crash ahead? 68% of top money managers see us in a bear market rally

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BAC -0.20% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SSE -1.17% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

A Bank of America (NYSE: ) survey of 223 fund managers during the week ended May 14 found 68% see the recent run-up as a bear market rally, rather than the beginnings of a bull market run. A bear market identifies as a sustained period of downward trending stock prices, often sparked by a 20% market drop.

After a robust market rally through April and May, things are slowing down. A virus spike in Beijing is fuelling fears of a second coronavirus wave. This is creating a cautious pause on global market rallies and triggering the price of oil to fall again. If a second coronavirus wave takes hold globally, a significant market pull-back is likely. The impact will be bigger on stocks tied to an expected economic recovery such as travel and entertainment.

Forget day trading In a bear market, stock price volatility is a given, so it can be tempting to get in and out of stocks quickly to make fast profits. This is not a good idea. Even the best day traders can realise big losses when market sentiment is low. I think a long-term investing strategy is a more sensible option. Something along the lines of Warren Buffett’s value investing strategy will bring you future wealth if you are disciplined and patient.

Robust stocks to buy in a bear market The is the UK’s most popular financial index and its constituents tend to be large-cap, stable companies. This is the first place I would look for robust stocks to buy in a downturn. Choosing stocks that will always be in demand, such as consumer staples, like food, alcohol, tobacco and toiletries is a good place to start. Utilities should also remain in demand, for example electricity, water and telecoms.

Energy generator and distributor SSE (LON: ) is a stock I would consider. The SSE share price has had a volatile time. In February it was flying high, reaching close to a 10-year pinnacle. Since then its shares have fluctuated a lot and are now down 28%.

With close to half of all FTSE 100 firms slashing their dividends in recent weeks, income investors are left with slim pickings. So far SSE is one company that has kept its dividend intact, but whether that will still be the case later this week remains to be seen. SSE will be revealing its full-year results on Wednesday.

Risky stocks to buy in a bear market Oil and gas stocks are risky at the best of times, but a bear market can provide an opportunity to buy them cheaply. Fossil fuels are a necessary evil, but despite moves to have them phased out, this will not happen soon. They are still very much required and in time the oil price will rise again. However, not all oil stocks will survive, and recovery will be a lengthy process. BP (LON: ) and Shell (LON: ) are my favourite UK oil stocks because they have vast industry experience, they are investing heavily in renewables and have access to much more liquidity than many of their smaller industry peers.

I think another stock market crash is highly likely, but that does not mean you should stop investing. If you are careful about the stocks you choose and patient enough to see them rise again, you can still grow a sizeable portfolio for the future.

Investing.com -- The oil and gas industry will never have it as good again.

That’s the takeaway from BP’s announcement Monday, which carried a warning of “between $13 billion and $17.5 billion” in asset writedowns in the second quarter.

The move is the first big action by new chief executive Bernard Looney to bring the company into line with the straitened circumstances of the post-Covid world. It’s unlikely to be the last.

The writedowns reflect that BP (NYSE: ) expects prices to be lower for longer because the pandemic will have “an enduring impact on the global economy, with the potential for weaker demand for energy for a sustained period.”

The news pushed BP shares down 4.0% by 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT) to a two-week low. They also pulled the 1.4% lower, while the broader drag on oil and gas stocks elsewhere contributed to the falling 1.1%.

Not only will the world want less energy than BP previously thought, it will also want cleaner energy.

“Management also has a growing expectation that the aftermath of the pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system, as countries seek to 'build back better' so that their economies will be more resilient in the future,” it said in a statement to the stock exchange.

BP now expects to average around $55 a barrel in the medium term, down from a working assumption of $60 previously. It also sees benchmark U.S. prices at $2.90 per million British thermal units, a level they haven’t seen for 15 months.

The new price forecasts are especially ominous for assets that BP has not yet begun developing. The company is expecting to write up to $10 billion off its exploration intangible assets, or 70% of the value they’re currently held at on the balance sheet.

The obvious corollary of Monday’s announcement is that BP’s operations will be generating less cash in future. That leaves Looney with the hard choice of either selling more and more marginal assets, with long-term consequences for its global clout and capabilities, cutting the group’s dividend.

Taking on ever more debt to keep payouts at their current level – as it did in the last quarter – is not an option if the company believes its own forecasts. BP’s road back to financial health from the Deepwater Horizon disaster has been long and painful, and it’s hard to see Looney throwing all of his predecessor’s good work away by simply hoping for things to improve.

The good news is that that much is already in the price. According to Investing.com data, the stock is currently yielding over 10%. In truth, that merely reflects expectations that the payout will be slashed by more than half, as rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) did at its first-quarter results. Having seen what Shell did, and what BP didn't do, in April, the only surprise is that the market was still surprised by the news.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-bp-cuts-admit-big-oil-will-never-have-it-so-good-again-2141177,0.064,0.846,0.09,0.9043

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Monday, as a jump in reported Covid-19 cases over the weekend prompted fears of a second wave of infections. Losses at BP (NYSE: ) after it took hefty charges also weigh.

At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the in Germany traded 2.6% lower, 40 fell 2.7%, the U.K.'s index was down 2.1%.

Earlier Monday, oil giant BP (LON: ) said it expects to take up to $17.5 billion of charges in its second-quarter earnings to reflect what it expects will be the ""enduring"" effects of the pandemic, in the form of lower oil prices.

BP stock slumped 5%, dragging the dominant sector and other oil majors lower. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) fell 4%, ENI (MI: ) dropped 3% and Total (PA: ) slipped 3.1%.

Prices had already been on course to open lower after China reported a new outbreak in Beijing’s Xinfadi wholesale food market over the weekend, prompting its closure as well as the locking down of nearby housing districts.

In Japan, Tokyo also reported Sunday its highest number of new cases in around a month, with the majority of cases traced back to recently re-opened nightclubs and bars.

This all followed a spike in cases in the United States, where more than 25,000 new cases were reported on Saturday.

Stock markets had benefited from a strong rally since late March, fueled by central bank and fiscal stimulus and optimism as countries gradually lifted their lockdown policies put in place to curb the spread of the virus.

Back in Europe, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to meet with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday in a bid to revive stalled talks on post-Brexit ties. So far there hasn’t been much progress on a free-trade agreement and there’s not much time left to extend the end-2020 deadline for a deal.

In corporate news, easyJet (LON: ) aircraft resumed flights Monday for the first time since March 30, beginning mainly with a small number of domestic U.K. flights after weeks of lockdown. Still, easyJet stock fell 2.7% amid these fears of a second wave of the coronavirus. Scandinavian airline SAS (CSE: ) stock rose 3.0% after the governments of Sweden and Denmark indicated they would support a $1.3 billion recapitalization plan. Local rival Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (OL: ) fell 15%.

Movie theater operator Cineworld (LON: ) will also be in focus after it pulled out of its deal to buy Cineplex, a move that will ease concerns about its debt levels. Cineworld stock fell 1.2%, outperforming the wider market.

Oil prices slumped Monday, extending losses from last week, as new coronavirus infections hit China and the United States, potentially hitting the already fragile recovery in fuel demand.

The oil benchmarks fell about 8% last week, their first weekly declines since April.

At 3:45 AM ET, futures traded 3.9% lower at $34.83 a barrel. The international benchmark contract fell 2.7% to $37.71.

(Bloomberg) -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, the world’s largest liquefied trader, expects buying and selling of the fastest-growing fuel to recover to levels seen before the pandemic.

Global LNG demand took a severe hit when nations imposed lockdowns to combat the spread of the coronavirus, impacting the fuel’s use in everything from power plants to transport and factories. That came on top of the biggest glut of the fuel the world has ever seen, helped by two mild winters in a row.

“We still very much believe that with the current supply-demand outlook, this is a fundamentally strong sector that will grow at a rate that is close to 4% per year, Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive officer, said in an interview.

His comments show that Shell is sticking to the optimism showed in its annual LNG Outlook in February, before the Covid-19 pandemic started to ravage markets on a global scale.

In its outlook, Shell said it expects annual LNG demand to double to 700 million tons by 2040. Consumption increased by a record 13% to 359 million tons in 2019.

But even the global leader will feel some pain in the short term. Shell warned in April that its gas liquefaction volumes may fall in the second quarter.

The company and its peers slashed spending to cope with the collapse in oil prices. International majors have cut capital spending by 20% to 30% with projects being put on hold or shelved altogether. Shell walked away from the multibillion-dollar Lake Charles LNG terminal in March because of the glut, but Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl has said production cuts across its oil and gas portfolio would not be permanent.

Biggest Trader

Shell became the world’s top participant in the LNG business after the acquisition of BG Group Plc in 2016, which boosted its portfolio of supply contracts and stakes in LNG plants around the world.

“We will obviously flex our investment program to be aligned with where we believe the sector will go, but the profitability of the business and the outlook of this business is going to be as good as what you saw before the pandemic,” van Beurden said.

Global LNG demand has surpassed expectations this year, industry consultant Timera Energy, said in a note Monday.

Gas prices in Europe, one of the key consumers regions, could also “surprise to the upside” in the next two to three years as the glut gradually disappears, Timera said. The recovery has already started as lockdown measures are lifted and demand could be back to normal in the next few months, the company said.

£5k to invest in a JISA? This is the only FTSE 100 fund I’d buy

If you want to open a Junior ISA, known as a JISA, the number of investing options available to you can be totally overwhelming.

Funds, shares, bonds, gold, what’s best? Should you buy household names like Shell (LON: ) or Tesco? Or plump for lesser-known growth stocks on the FTSE 250?

JISA Einstein Mums and dads being furloughed — along with no school — has made for some fairly tense home situations. Yes, these truly are strange and difficult times. Furnishing your little ones with a JISA might be the last thing on your mind.

But a JISA can make the most of the greatest invention the world has ever devised. Einstein named it the eighth wonder of the world for good reason. This slice of genius is called compound interest.

We’d all like to make our son or daughter rich. But every good investor should follow Warren Buffett’s number one principle: don’t lose money. Because funds contain far more than a handful of individual shares, they are often less volatile. That means prices don’t tend to swing wildly back and forth. And funds are often just easier to deal with.

JISA Aristocrat SSGA SPDR ETFs Europe (LSE:UKDV) — better known by the ticker symbol UKDV — holds shares in 41 different FTSE 100 companies that are called ‘dividend aristocrats’. These are the top best-paying dividend shares in the FTSE 100.

Hold shares in this fund and you’ll be paid a 5% dividend into your JISA, twice every year.

Among the top companies held by the UKDV fund are renewable wind farm operator SSE (LON: ), water utility giant Pennon Group (LON: ), pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, and popular financial services company Legal & General.

The fund managers do all the calculations for you, which is good, and will even move certain shares in and out of the fund if they are underperforming.

You’ll pay a small management fee of 0.3% to hold this fund in a JISA. Reinvest your dividends — there’ll be a tickbox option in your JISA settings — and you can buy up more shares in the fund at no extra cost. This is where Einstein’s magic happens. Reinvesting dividends equals compound interest.

Working magic Each year you can put up to £9,000 into a JISA, tax free. Those last two words are extremely important. It means any capital gains (from share price rises) or dividends (paid out by companies from profits) are entirely free from tax in the JISA.

Family and friends are also allowed to contribute to a JISA, if you want to steer your kids away from birthday presents of soon-discarded Nintendo Switch games or the latest trainers.

You can open a JISA when your child is at any age. Add the maximum each year and in five years’ time you’ll have a very healthy £45,000. But use Einstein’s eighth wonder of the world and my suggestions of a 5% dividend fund, with the dividends reinvested? That £45,000 has just turned into £60,788.

Just imagine what you could do if you leave it till they are 18?

Even at small contributions, the amounts you can add from dividend investing are quite staggering. Say you can only start with £100 a month. Leave it long enough — 18 years would do it — and if the rates remain relatively constant, you’d come away with a JISA worth £31,713.

By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla

LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (N: ) is preparing to restart the sale of its British North Sea assets after weaker oil prices and the coronavirus outbreak led to months of delay, industry and banking sources said.

The sale process, initially planned for late last year, is expected to raise less than originally expected after a 40% drop in oil prices since January and their weakened long-term outlook.

The top U.S. oil company has in recent weeks held talks with a number of potential North Sea buyers to gauge interest in the portfolio, four sources with direct knowledge of the discussions said on condition of anonymity.

Exxon is unlikely to officially launch the sale process if it finds there is insufficient interest, the sources said.

Exxon declined to comment.

""As a matter of practice, ExxonMobil does not comment on market rumours or speculation about our business plans,"" Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said.

Most of Exxon's British operations are managed through Esso Exploration and Production UK, a 50-50 joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), and include interests in nearly 40 oil and gas fields.

The JV, one of the industry's oldest, has been producing gas since 1968 and oil since 1976.

The portfolio's value, however, is unclear.

Initially, Irving, Texas-headquartered Exxon hoped to raise over $2 billion (£1.6 billion) from the sale, according to the sources.

They said $1 to $1.5 billion was more likely now given the oil market's weakness.

A spokeswoman for investment bank Jefferies, which is running the sale process, declined to comment.

With many of the assets approaching the end of their lives, their value will depend largely on how the buyer and Exxon agree to manage the costs of plugging wells and removing unused platforms, a process known as decommissioning.

Potential buyers could include large private equity-backed North Sea producers such as Chrysaor and NEO Exploration & Production. HitecVision, which owns NEO, and Chrysaor declined to comment.

Exxon produces around 80,000 barrels of oil and 441 million cubic feet of gas a day in the British North Sea, roughly 5% of Britain's daily demand, its website says.

Exxon plans to sell up to $25 billion of assets globally over the coming years to release cash to focus on a handful of mega-projects, three banking sources said.

Last month Exxon also revived the sale of its stake in Azerbaijan's largest oil field, sources told Reuters.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusive-exxon-set-to-revive-north-sea-sale-after-months-of-delays--sources-2139445,0.034,0.895,0.071,0.9022

Oil share prices are fickle beasts. Oil exploration and production (E&P) companies heavily exposed to the price of black gold can experience high share price volatility. In addition, the recent plunging oil price is thought to make life very hard for any organisation relying on oil for its main source of revenue.

Likewise, the coronavirus shutdown makes life difficult for many FTSE-listed firms. The plummeting demand for products and services encourages investors to sell shares. Many flock to ‘safer’ assets such as cash. With bond yields now so low, a Cash ISA is an attractive alternative.

However, Cash ISA rates are not much higher than the current UK rate of inflation of 1.2%. So, while cash shouldn’t lose you money, it won’t make you much either. Unlike, potentially, oil share prices.

Oil share prices By oil share prices, I’m referring to the shares of companies based in the oil industry. Companies like integrated oil major, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB), and smaller E&P companies, Premier Oil (LSE: LON: ) and Tullow Oil (LSE: LON: ).

The share prices of all three companies plummeted with the rest of the near the end of March. However, by the time the price reached its bottom on 21 April, shares in all three companies were up between 40% and 115%.

The smaller E&P companies experienced an immediate small dip in price, likely as a result of the oil price drop. Shell’s share price, in contrast, kept climbing. And the overall trend for all three companies since this date is a very positive one.

Demand shock beginning to lift This shows that the demand shock created by the government’s coronavirus-induced shutdown affected share prices of oil companies far more than the declining oil price.

The good news is that the lockdown is beginning to lift globally, which should increase demand once again. Great news for oil firms and their shareholders.

Royal Dutch Shell is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of around 15. This is below the oil and gas industry average of 17, meaning its shares are still relatively cheap.

In addition, despite its dividend cut, Shell offers an estimated forward dividend yield of around 3.7%. This is far in excess of a good Cash ISA rate, around 1.5%. And if demand does increase, as I think likely, then there is also the prospect of capital gains to look forward to.

Premier Oil and Tullow Oil are trading at P/Es of 2.9 and 2.5, respectively. Premier isn’t paying a dividend currently, but Tullow’s is around 6%. Again, a rate far in excess of even the best Cash ISA. However, with reward comes risk – both these smaller companies are heavily debt-laden.

Shell, in contrast, is integrated and it can use cheaper oil prices to improve margins at its refineries. It can also use its trading arm to create value. This makes it a far better investment, in my view, so it’s unsurprising its share price has been climbing.

So, for now, I’m forgetting my Cash ISA. There are higher returns to be made on the oil share prices, and on the majors in particular.

How to prepare for ANOTHER stock market crash in 2020

BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio TSCO +0.04% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

The stock market crash in March was dramatic. And the recovery has been quite impressive. However, I believe that there will be another stock market crash this year. Here’s how I’d prepare for it.

Reasons for another stock market crash The coronavirus restrictions have led to an unprecedented drop in economic activity. Because the UK’s economy relies heavily on the services sector, it has suffered more than many European countries. However, the contraction is certainly global. Furthermore, the second Covid-19 wave has started too. For example, the US is seeing a rise in coronavirus hospitalisations, in Texas and California in particular.

Apart from the Covid-19 downturn, there are many other political and macroeconomic factors that investors have to consider. First of all, the risks of a no-deal Brexit are extremely high now. The Government seems to be taking a hard stance towards negotiations with the EU. The main emphasis is on executing Brexit before the December deadline. But it looks like agreement on many issues, including business regulations and fishing rights, is a long way off.

There is another risk that could lead to a stock market crash in 2020. This is the political situation in the US. The Covid-19 downturn and current protests are taking place just before the presidential elections. This could lead to higher market volatility, not just in America but all over the world. The UK’s markets are at risk as well because many Footsie companies are multinationals and heavily depend on the US.

This is what I’d do First of all, investors should stop worrying and start preparing. Even though a stock market crash can heavily impact most firms, large companies are highly likely to survive. For example, the oil industry is heavily impacted by the current downturn but companies such as Shell (LON: ) and BP (LON: ) will most probably do well in the long run. This is because of their cash holdings, high credit ratings, and market leading positions.

However, many of the risks mentioned above are global. The political situation in the US and a hard Brexit would be much more harmful for firms that have close links with the US and Europe. Investors who would like to hedge their portfolios against such risks might do well by considering large domestic companies. What are they? Well, the most obvious example is Tesco (LON: ).

It enjoys a really good competitive position in the UK and seems to benefit from its economies of scale. It seems to me that even if the whole world sinks into a Great Depression, which I do not think is most likely, UK consumers will still go shopping there. Why? Because Tesco sells groceries as well as other essentials. Regardless of their incomes, consumers still have to eat and drink, and these are the last things they will reduce their spending on.

However, Tesco is not the only company for conservative investors to buy. There are many UK companies that are large, stable, and paying good dividends.

Investing in renewable energy: 1 AIM stock I’m watching

SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

ITM Power (LSE:ITM) is an energy storage and clean-fuel company specialising in expanding UK hydrogen power. Companies and governments are increasingly looking at investing in renewable energy. Hydrogen power could be the future of green energy providing it can be harnessed in a way that is affordable to the masses. It also makes for an ethical alternative to investing in oil stocks. The ITM Power share price is up 11% this morning.

Disappointing financial results Earlier in the week, ITM warned that total income for the year to April 30 had fallen 60% year-on-year. This is due to a combination of project delays and losses on legacy projects, including the Shell (LON: ) Refhyne project. Its recent joint venture with Linde, an engineering procurement and construction (EPC) specialist, should reduce the risk of this happening again.

ITM made a £9.8m loss from operations, an increase of 85%. As far as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) were concerned, it lost an 84% wider £8.3m and it spent 29% more cash.

ITM has been a constituent of the London Stock Exchange’s AIM market since 2004. It has a market cap of £1.3bn, does not offer a dividend, while earnings per share are negative. This makes it a purely speculative, high-risk investment. However, for those savvy investors buying-in a year ago, the ITM Power share price has risen 750%.

Renewable energy stimulus World governments are setting up stimulus packages to assist renewable projects in an attempt to clean up the planet. Germany has allocated €9bn to spend on green hydrogen projects. It aims for this to eventually contribute 10% of the country’s total electricity capacity. Meanwhile, The Australian Renewable Energy Agency opened a £38m round of funding for renewable hydrogen projects in April. It has received 36 applications for projects worth over £1.6bn, far overreaching expectations.

Race to Zero is a UK government initiative designed to mobilise leadership from businesses, cities, regions and nations to stimulate a zero-carbon recovery. We expect the UK Government to lay out its green recovery measures and plans for investing in renewable energy later this month.

Partnered with Linde, it seems ITM Power stands to capitalise on many of the climate change opportunities arising. The number of projects to tender for are growing, highlighting the increase in green hydrogen interest throughout the world.

With so many companies and countries competing in the race to harness this technology, the stakes are high. Yet despite government stimulus investing in renewable energy at an increasing pace, this business is unlikely to become profitable any time soon. The UK stock market is on shaky ground as the country heads into recession. I think share price volatility will continue for the foreseeable future. This is not a stock the risk-averse investor should buy, but I do think it is a stock with growth potential for those willing to take a gamble.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) has launched the sale of its stakes in two oilfields and two pipelines in Norway, according to a sales document seen by Reuters.

Shell is selling its 6.45% interest in the Kvitebjorn field and pipeline and its 3.225% interest in the Valemon Unit and Valemon Rich Gas Pipeline, according to the document.

The offshore assets are operated by state-controlled Norwegian oil firm Equinor (OL: ).

They access to a resource of 17 million barrels of oil equivalent with an annual daily production of 7,200 barrels of oil equivalent, according to the document.

The assets are expected to raise between $50 and $100 million (£79 million) in total, according to industry and banking sources.

A Shell spokesman said: ""Shell continuously evaluates opportunities for our global portfolio including our position in Norway. We are not able to comment on activities that we may or may not engage in due to commercial sensitivities, and have nothing more to add at this time.""

Shell is currently a partner in 34 production licences offshore Norway and operates 14 of them, according to its annual report.

In 2018, Shell sold several of its Norwegian assets to OKEA, a Norwegian producer backed by private equity firm Seacrest Capital, for $566 million.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-launches-sale-of-stakes-in-norwegian-fields-pipelines--document-2139165,0.008,0.913,0.079,0.9308

(Bloomberg) -- The largest oil exchange traded fund was cleared by U.S. regulators to issue 1 billion new shares, paving the way for renewed investments into the popular retail product that’s been at the center of controversy in recent months.

The Securities and Exchange Commission approval comes nearly 8 weeks after the United States Oil Fund (NYSE: ) said that it issued all remaining registered shares, a move driven by tremendous interest in the sector as crude prices plunged into negative territory for the first time in history. In that period, it’s been subject to limits from the world’s biggest commodity exchanges, had to find new brokers and even found itself subject to regulatory investigations.

The $4.9 billion ETF, known by its ticker USO, has came under close scrutiny as oil’s rapid plunge forced it to quickly shift some of its giant positions on short notice. While West Texas Intermediate crude is down about 40% so far this year, USO has lost more than 70% of its value, becoming unhinged from tracking just the front-month futures contract due to restrictions from various regulators and brokers.

Both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have opened probes into USO, people familiar with the matter said late last month, examining whether its risks were properly disclosed.

While its ability to accept new money has been halted, United States Commodity Funds, which runs USO, has been actively signing agreements with new brokers, including Marex Spectron and ED&F Man. The moves supplement an existing agreement with RBC Capital Markets, whose risk mitigation measures had stopped the fund from being able to add more exposure.

Throughout April and May, the ETF roiled oil prices after receiving record inflows from investors trying to call the bottom in crude’s rout. Its position in the June WTI contract at one point grew to represent 30% of the total open interest, worrying some about its outsized impact in the market.

The growing scale prompted CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ: ), the exchange, to instruct it to limit its position in several futures contracts. That forced it to spread its holdings out to different contracts for delivery as far in the future as June 2021, reducing its impact on any single calendar month.

Some of the USO’s stress has also been felt on other similar products after crude’s tumble toward negative $40 a barrel on April 20 forced issuers into a series of unusual steps. The broker for the $500 million Samsung (KS: ) S&P GSCI ER Futures ETF, for example, in early May restricted any new buying of crude futures. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc forced the $500 million WisdomTree ETP to shut down amid increased scrutiny of how retail investors are punting in the oil market. Others had to delist completely.

SINGAPORE/LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Ian Taylor, who built Vitol into the world's biggest oil trader, has died from pneumonia at the age of 64, the company said on Tuesday, after surviving bouts of cancer and a stroke last year.

From drinking with Fidel Castro to providing billions of dollars to Kazakhstan, Taylor was known as a risk taker who even flew to Libya during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi.

In 1995 the Oxford University graduate became CEO of Vitol, which with Britain's blessing supplied the opposition in Benghazi with vital fuel in exchange for cargoes.

During Taylor's time in charge, Vitol also carried on trading Iranian fuel oil in 2012, despite U.S. sanctions.

Glencore (LON: )'s CEO Ivan Glasenberg said Taylor was ""one of the last of the pioneers that helped transform the oil trading industry"", adding that he would be missed.

Described by his successor Russell Hardy as ""exceptional"", Taylor became one of Britain's richest businessmen and in 2007 stepped in to save Scottish fabric maker Harris Tweed Hebrides.

""He combined energy and a determination to succeed with humility, humour and humanity,"" Hardy said in a statement.

A Conservative party donor who turned down the offer of a knighthood from former British Prime Minister David Cameron, Taylor was chairman of the Royal Opera House until 2019.

After starting his career at Shell (LON: ) in 1978 and working in South America and southeast Asia, Taylor joined privately-owned Vitol [VITOLV.UL] in 1985, turning the once modest Dutch fuel dealer into a global trading operation.

""Ian was a formidable figure in the modern commodities trading industry, and central to the establishment of Vitol as a successful company,"" Trafigura CEO Jeremy Weir said.

SINGAPORE/LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Ian Taylor, who built Vitol into the world's biggest oil trader, has died from pneumonia at the age of 64, the company said on Tuesday, after surviving bouts of cancer and a stroke last year.

From drinking with Fidel Castro to providing billions of dollars to Kazakhstan, Taylor was known as a risk taker who even flew to Libya during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi.

In 1995 the Oxford University graduate became CEO of Vitol, which with Britain's blessing supplied the opposition in Benghazi with vital fuel in exchange for cargoes.

During Taylor's time in charge, Vitol also carried on trading Iranian fuel oil in 2012, despite U.S. sanctions.

Glencore (LON: )'s CEO Ivan Glasenberg said Taylor was ""one of the last of the pioneers that helped transform the oil trading industry"", adding that he would be missed.

Described by his successor Russell Hardy as ""exceptional"", Taylor became one of Britain's richest businessmen and in 2007 stepped in to save Scottish fabric maker Harris Tweed Hebrides.

""He combined energy and a determination to succeed with humility, humour and humanity,"" Hardy said in a statement.

A Conservative party donor who turned down the offer of a knighthood from former British Prime Minister David Cameron, Taylor was chairman of the Royal Opera House until 2019.

After starting his career at Shell (LON: ) in 1978 and working in South America and southeast Asia, Taylor joined privately-owned Vitol [VITOLV.UL] in 1985, turning the once modest Dutch fuel dealer into a global trading operation.

""Ian was a formidable figure in the modern commodities trading industry, and central to the establishment of Vitol as a successful company,"" Trafigura CEO Jeremy Weir said.

Vitol, run out of London, became the biggest trading rival to BP (LON: ) and Shell under Taylor, partly by poaching their top staff. Last year, the firm traded around 8 million barrels of oil per day.

""We owe him a great deal,"" Hardy added.

Top UK dividend stocks pay some of the most generous yields in the world, but their reputation has slipped lately. After the Covid-19 crisis and stock market crash, UK dividend cuts and deferrals total more than £31bn. If you have £5k – or any sum – to invest right now, there are stop plenty of top stocks to choose from.

Many big names have stopped their dividends, including Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), Aviva (LON: ), ITV (LON: ), RSA, and all the big banks. The result is that just 10 stocks now pay 55% of all UK dividends, according to AJ Bell.

This still leaves a third of the FTSE 100 paying dividends, with the index still likely to yield a solid 3.5% this year. That remains an attractive rate of return, at a time when you can barely get 1% on cash.

Check out these FTSE 100 shares You can secure an even higher rate of income by selecting some of the best paying UK dividend stocks of all. Any company that can stand by its dividend in troubled times like these must have a reasonably solid foundation.

Oil giant BP (LON: ), tobacco firm British American Tobacco (LON: ), miner Rio Tinto (LON: ), pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, telecoms supplier Vodafone (LON: ), and household goods specialist Unilever (LON: ) are now the top six biggest dividend stocks listed on the FTSE 100. This is where I would start my search for UK dividend stocks to build a rising passive income in retirement.

Rival oil major Royal Dutch Shell has dropped its dividend, but BP is standing by its payout. Right now, it yields an astonishing 8.97%. While no dividend is guaranteed, the rising oil price should boost the chances of BP maintaining its payout. Oil faces an uncertain future, as green concerns grow, but is till the mainstay of the global economy.

Top UK dividend stocks for income Cigarette sales also face an uncertain future, as health-conscious Western smokers cut back and electronic alternatives meet regulatory resistance. Despite this, British American Tobacco continues to generate huge sales, and currently yields 6.61%. The overall market may be shrinking, but its share remains strong.

Mining giant Rio Tinto should see demand for its metals and minerals pick up when the global economy recovers, and has stood by its dividend throughout the crisis. Arguably, every investors should have exposure to the commodity sector, and this UK dividend stock yields a generous 6.62%.

The AstraZeneca share price is one of the few to grow strongly this year, as investors focus on health during the pandemic. Measured over five years, it has almost doubled, which partly explains why the yield is a relatively low 2.61%. It looks expensive, and I would prefer Vodafone and Unilever, which yield 5.76% and 4.65% respectively.

I particularly like Unilever, who share price has taken a hit this year, and trades at 19 times earnings, which is relatively low by its standards.

As ever, do your own research, and make sure any stock pick balances your existing holdings. There are still top UK dividend stocks out there, if you know where to look.

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (L: ) will cut about 15% of its workforce in response to the coronavirus crisis and as part of Chief Executive Bernard Looney's plan to shift the oil and gas major to renewable energy, it said on Monday.

Looney told employees in a global online call that the London-based company will cut 10,000 jobs from the current 70,100.

""We will now begin a process that will see close to 10,000 people leaving BP – most by the end of this year,"" Looney said in a statement.

Reuters had earlier reported the planned job cuts, citing three company sources.

BP shares were up 3.3% by 1230 GMT, against a 2.2% gain for the broader European energy sector ( ).

The affected roles will be mostly senior office-based positions and not front-line operational staff, the company said.

About a fifth of the job cuts will take place in Britain, where BP employs 15,000 people, a company spokesman said.

Like all the world's top energy companies, BP has cut its 2020 spending plans after the coronavirus pandemic brought an unprecedented drop in demand for oil. BP has flagged a 25% cut to $12 billion this year and said it would find $2.5 billion in cost savings by the end of 2021 through the digitalisation and integration of its businesses.

On Monday, however, Looney said the company is likely to need to cut costs even further.

BP is giving no pay rises to senior employees until March 2021 and said it is unlikely to pay any cash bonuses this year.

ENERGY TRANSITION

The job reductions are also part of Looney's drive to make the 111-year-old oil company more nimble as it prepares for the shift to low-carbon energy, the sources said.

""It was always part of the plan to make BP a leaner, faster-moving and lower-carbon company,"" Looney said.

The spokesman said that the coronavirus crisis ""amplified and accelerated"" BP's transition plans.

Looney last month announced a large round of senior management appointments, halving the size of BP's leaderhip team under his plan to reshape the company's structure.

Shortly after taking office in February, the 49-year-old CEO said that he was creating 11 divisions to ""reinvent"" BP and dismantle the traditional structure dominated by its oil and gas production business and its refining, marketing and trading division.

Chevron Corp (N: ), the second-largest U.S. oil producer, last month said that it will cut between 10% and 15% of its global workforce as part of an ongoing restructuring.

Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), meanwhile, has initiated a voluntary redundancy programme.

Forget the Ocado share price! I’d rather buy Royal Dutch Shell

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LCO -0.16% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio OCDO -2.32% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

The Ocado (LON: ) share price was one of the few to hold firm during the stock market crash. With the nation in lockdown, home food deliveries became an essential service. Astonishingly, the group is up 60% in this turbulent year, against a 15% drop on the index as a whole. Yet I’d be wary of buying it today.

The Ocado Group (LSE: OCDO) share price success is no flash in the pan. It’s one of the most successful on the FTSE 100, rising an incredible 580% in just three years. So why would I choose to buy the Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) share price instead?

My big fear is that Ocado’s shares have risen too fast, too quickly. The online grocer has a lot of hard work ahead of it, to justify today’s valuation. It may get there, but recent share price growth could go into reverse if it has any setbacks.

FTSE 100 stock market crash hero The lockdown delivery surge that saw customers battling for precious Ocado slots is over, unless we get a second wave of the pandemic. Competition in this area may rise too. Witness the tie-up between Aldi UK and Deliveroo.

Group sales doubled in the second quarter, but that can’t continue. On the other hand, Ocado will have picked up new customers, many of them elderly who will continue to see the benefits of shopping online.

To justify today’s sky-high Ocado share price, management has to deliver on hopes of becoming a global technology company, helping grocers around the world robotise their warehouses. It’s an exciting target, but expensive to achieve. Ocado has posted a loss for five years in a row.

The good news is that revenues are growing at a much faster rate than others in the supermarket sector. The Ocado share price could climb higher still, but I think the pace has to slow and it’s also vulnerable to bad news.

By contrast, Royal Dutch Shell has had a rotten year. The twin stock market and oil price collapse hit it hard. Its legendary dividend, never been cut since the Second World War, has finally fallen. At least for now.

Better value than the Ocado share price? The Shell share price is still down a third this year, despite its recent recovery. It trades at just over nine times earnings. That looks a tempting valuation, especially with oil now climbing, and trading above $42 a barrel.

As the world emerges out of lockdown, demand may increase. At the same time, OPEC+ production cuts may hold. The oil price may climb higher. If it does, pressure will grow to bring the dividend back.

When it does return, the Shell share price could enjoy another jump upwards. It’s up 16% over the last month and I think it has more scope for growth than the Ocado share price.

Naturally, Shell faces plenty of challenges too. Notably the long-term shift away from fossil fuels, and into renewables. However, many of the risks are in today’s price. Now may prove a good time to buy this FTSE 100 dividend hero, before it recovers further.

Oil stocks have faced a torrid time over the last couple of months. This has even seen oil prices briefly turn negative, due to the significant lack of demand. But with supply being restricted, and demand also picking up, the price of Crude has now reached over $42. This should rise further once restrictions are lifted and activity returns to normal. Therefore, it could be the perfect time to capitalise on cheap oil stocks. My top pick is Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) shares.

The cut dividend It was a major surprise when Shell cut its dividend by 66% for the first time since the Second World War. But while disappointing in the short-term, I believe that the dividend cut will benefit Shell shares in the future. In fact, the cut will save it around $10bn a year and will help shore up the balance sheet. Shell shares are also still yielding nearly 4%, which is significantly more than many stocks on the at the moment. Furthermore, the new dividend is more sustainable that its previous yield of over 10%.

Adapting to a new environment Management has seemed very aware of the changing environment for oil shares and looks as if it will be able to adapt. This has included investing in lower-carbon technology. I recently wrote about how I think the future is in renewable energy, and Shell has increased its exposure to renewables in the past few years. This has included a growing network of hydrogen stations, the use of biofuels, and investment into solar energy. I believe this will ensure the longevity of the company and benefit Shell shares in the future.

Shell has also suspended its programme of buying back shares. This will help provide further liquidity to the firm during this time. But this should not take away from the fact that Shell has made a number of poor decisions recently. An example is spending $16bn in two years on buying-back shares at the price of £22. Net debt of over $70bn may also seem fairly unsustainable at this moment.

Shell shares are extremely cheap Despite these mistakes, the current price is still ridiculously cheap. In fact, Shell shares have lost around 40% year-to-date. This has left them trading at a price-to-book ratio of 0.8 and a P/E ratio of 7.9. Both these figures indicate an extremely cheap valuation. The quality and leading market position of the firm also places the stock in a better position than others in the oil industry. This includes names such as Tullow Oil (LON: ) and Premier Oil (LON: ) which, while extremely cheap, seem at a much greater risk of collapse. The price of Shell shares has also been pushed considerably lower than BP (LON: ), which has maintained a potentially unsustainable dividend. This means that I think Royal Dutch Shell offers the best opportunity for those who want to invest in the oil recovery.

Is the Hurricane Energy share price too cheap to ignore?

SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HBR +0.79% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

The Hurricane Energy (LSE: HUR) share price plunged again this morning, after the company reported the resignation of founder and CEO Dr Robert Trice.

Dr Trice has been the driving figure behind the group’s mission to explore and commercialise so-called fractured basement reservoirs in the North Sea.

Until May, early production results from the Lancaster oil field appeared to justify his confidence. But last month, the company admitted it hadn’t been able to hit its production target of 20,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd).

Hurricane’s share price has now fallen by more than 70% this year, leaving it lagging behind UK producers such as Serica Energy, Premier Oil (LON: ) and Enquest.

Today, I want to take a fresh look at this business. Are Hurricane shares now too cheap to ignore?

Where did it all go wrong? In testing during April and May, Hurricane had hoped to ramp up combined production from the two Lancaster wells to 20,000 bopd. These efforts failed.

On 22 May, Hurricane said it had decided to shut down one well due to interference between the two wells. Lancaster production was stuck at about 10,300 bopd.

Dr Trice said that each well performed well individually, but “the degree of interference encountered is unexpected.” Although they’re close to each other, the two Lancaster wells were expected to access different areas of the reservoir. But these results suggest to me that, in simple terms, both wells may be accessing the same oil.

If I’m right, this would be an embarrassing failure for Hurricane — and a possible trigger for Dr Trice’s resignation today.

What’s next for Hurricane? Dr Trice’s resignation suggests to me that the board has lost confidence in his strategy and projections. He will be replaced by interim CEO Beverley Smith, who has 30 years’ experience in production geology and field development, mostly with BG Group.

The firm’s largest investor, Kerogen Capital, has also replaced its nominated director with a technical specialist. Dr Alan Parsley is a geologist with over 50 years’ experience, mostly in senior exploration and production roles at Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ).

The board has also established a new technical committee to oversee “critical technical matters and Reserves and Resources disclosures.”

Taken together, these changes suggest to me the board is taking a fresh, critical look at Hurricane’s assets. The firm has promised to provide updated reserve and resource estimates by the end of March 2021.

Hurricane share price: buy or sell? Despite Hurricane’s problems, the firm is currently producing (and selling) around 12,000 bopd of oil from Lancaster. There could be some value here. But I do have some serious concerns.

Today’s update mentions “the need to strengthen the group’s balance sheet” and to increase production. This suggests to me that cash flow from current production is not enough make the business self-sustaining. This could be bad news for shareholders. In my experience, rescue fundraisings normally dilute investors who don’t take part.

I’m also worried that Hurricane’s resource estimates may be downgraded. Lancaster may not contain as much oil as we thought.

Personally, I wouldn’t wait around to find out. In my view, Hurricane shares are now highly speculative and very risky. I think there are better buys elsewhere in the oil sector.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) said on Tuesday it had resumed activities at its Bajada de Añelo block in Argentina's Vaca Muerta area after seismic activity in the region led to a halt late last week.

""Shell Argentina resumed its activities on Pad 22 of the Bajada de Añelo block, after determining that the conditions for a safe and sustainable return to work were guaranteed,"" the company said in a statement.

The oil firm said on Saturday it had suspended activities after seismic movements in an area of Argentina's Neuquén province near the Andes mountains bordering on Chile.

Tesco shares: are they worth buying right {{0|now}}?

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LLOY -0.41% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio TSCO +0.04% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BT -0.71% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio OCDO -2.32% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Tesco’s (LSE: TSCO) share price has held up pretty well this year. Year to date, Tesco (LON: ) shares are only down 11%. Compared to other popular stocks such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (-36%), BT Group (LON: ) (-38%) and Lloyds Bank (-43%), that’s a relatively good performance.

It’s not hard to understand why Tesco shares have outperformed many other FTSE 100 stocks. No matter what’s happening with the global economy, we still need food. So, Tesco has ‘defensive’ qualities. Is the stock worth buying now though? Here’s my view on the investment case for Tesco shares.

A defensive stock In the current environment, I do see some appeal in Tesco shares due to the company’s defensive attributes. Supermarkets, of course, are an essential service.

Interestingly, while other companies have been hit hard by the coronavirus, and still face plenty of uncertainty going forward, supermarkets appear to have actually benefited. Indeed, for the 12-week period to 17 May, UK grocery sales grew by 14.3% – the highest rate of growth in the 26 years since records have been kept.

Over that period, sales at Tesco rose a healthy 12.7%.

Ocado (LON: ) is smashing Tesco However, I’ll point out that other supermarkets grew faster than Tesco over that 12-week period. Much faster, in fact.

For example, Ocado – which has benefitted from the shift to online shopping – enjoyed sales growth of 32.5%. Meanwhile, sales at Iceland and Lidl jumped 28.6% and 16.5% respectively.

Ultimately, this pattern of growth leads me to believe that Tesco could continue to lose market share to other competitors. This is a trend that we have seen for years now.

Would Warren Buffett buy Tesco shares? And that brings me to my biggest concern in relation to Tesco shares. In my view, the company just doesn’t have a strong competitive advantage, or ‘economic moat’ as Warren Buffett likes to say.

The problem with Tesco is that there’s absolutely nothing to stop consumers shopping at a rival. This means it’s hard for the company to protect its sales and profits. And that’s not what you want as an investor. An economic moat is one of the first things that Buffett looks for when he invests in a stock.

Is Tesco’s share price a bargain? What about Tesco’s valuation? Is the FTSE 100 stock cheap? Well, analysts currently expect Tesco to generate earnings of 14.8p per share this year. So, at the current share price of 228p, that puts Tesco on a forward-looking P/E ratio of 15.4.

That’s not overly expensive, but it’s not super cheap either.

Tesco shares: I think you can do better Look, Tesco is certainly not the worst stock to own in the current environment. If economic conditions deteriorate further, Tesco shares could offer some protection.

However, all things considered, I think you can do better. Right now, I’d be looking for resilient, Buffett-type companies with strong competitive advantages that are poised for solid growth in the years ahead. No matter what happens to the global economy.

There are plenty of these types of companies if you know where to look.

(Bloomberg) -- OPEC+ agreed to a one-month extension of its record oil-production cuts and adopted a stricter approach to ensuring members don’t pump more than they pledged.

The deal will underpin the oil market’s recovery, easing the financial pain felt by resource-dependent emerging economies, shale explorers in Texas, and blue-chip companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc.

prices could rise to as much as $50 a barrel from Friday’s closing price of $42.30, according to consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd.

It’s a victory for Saudi Arabia and Russia, who put a destructive price war behind them to cajole Iraq, Nigeria and other laggards to fulfill their promises to cut production. The two leaders of OPEC+ showed that they intend to keep a close watch on the oil market. The group’s monitoring committee will now meet every month to assess the balance between supply and demand amid an uncertain economic recovery from the global pandemic.

“Our collective efforts have borne fruit, and despite many uncertainties, there are encouraging signs that we are over the worst,” said Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. “Demand is returning as big oil-consuming economies emerge from pandemic lockdown.”

After a video conference lasting several hours on Saturday, delegates said all nations had signed off on a new deal for a production cut of 9.6 million barrels a day next month. That’s 100,000 barrels a day lower than the reduction in June because Mexico will end its supply constraints, but a tighter limit than the 7.7 million barrels a day set for July in the group’s previous agreement.

In addition, any member that doesn’t implement all its production cuts in May and June will make extra reductions from July to September to compensate, according to an OPEC communique.

Those promises are a particular vindication for the Saudi minister, who has consistently pushed fellow members to stop cheating on their quotas since his appointment last year.

But they could also add an element of risk. In theory, the entirety of the 23-nation production agreement, which runs until April 2022, is now contingent on every member making 100% of their pledged cuts, according to the communique. That’s something rarely achieved in the 3-1/2 years that OPEC+ has existed, or indeed the decades-long history of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries itself.

Oil has just posted a sixth weekly gain in London, more than doubling since April with traders anticipating tighter supplies as demand recovers from lockdowns. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday hailed the cuts from OPEC and its allies for saving America’s energy industry. U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette also welcomed the deal on Saturday.

The oil market “is still in a fragile state and needs support,” Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in opening remarks at the virtual meeting. “That is why today more than ever it is important to adhere to 100% compliance.”

The group hopes to build on its success by pushing the market into a supply deficit next month, taking advantage of a price structure called backwardation to chip away at the billion barrels of oil stockpiles that built up during the pandemic.

There was no discussion at the meeting about the future of the additional 1.2 million barrels a day of voluntary cuts being implemented by Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies in June, delegates said.

The cartel will meet again in the second half of June for another review of the oil market. Talks are scheduled on June 18 for the Joint (NASDAQ: ) Ministerial Monitoring Committee, which could recommend a further extension if it’s deemed necessary, pushing the production curbs into August, a delegate said. That panel will meet every month until December.

The next full ministerial OPEC+ meeting has been scheduled for Nov. 30 to Dec. 1, delegates said, although the communique notes that a conference could be held whenever it is required.

Cutting production is always painful for oil-dependent states. Iraq in particular needs every penny because it’s still rebuilding its economy following decades of war, sanctions and Islamist insurgency.

The country made less than half of its assigned cutbacks last month, so compensating fully would require it to slash production by a further 24% to about 3.28 million barrels a day, according to Bloomberg calculations. Accepting such terms could risk a backlash from Iraqi parliamentarians and political parties loath to bow to foreign pressure.

The traditional shirkers in OPEC+ have promised many times before to do better. Some analysts are skeptical it will be any different this time.

“Everyone saves face with this agreement,” Jan Stuart, global energy economist at Cornerstone Macro LLC, said on Friday after a tentative deal was in place. “But it begs the question: What is the enforcement mechanism? I’m very curious to see how the organization is going to elicit greater compliance from the cheaters.”

There’s also a risk that future OPEC+ curbs could be undermined by a return of Libyan oil. The civil war there halted more than 1 million barrels a day of production, helping OPEC+ rebalance the market. But a cease-fire now opens the door for a gradual recovery of supply.

For now at least, members of OPEC+ can enjoy the price gains resulting from their deal.

“The oil market is on its way to recovery,” said Ann-Louise Hittle, oil analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “Supply has shifted dramatically already. Global demand is recovering too, with both May and June climbing from the low seen in April as the coronavirus-related shutdowns continue to ease.”

2020 UK recession: I’d invest in these cheap FTSE 100 shares to get rich and retire early

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio TSCO +0.04% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

The coronavirus pandemic has caused unprecedented damage to economies around the world. Supply chains have been disrupted and unemployment has risen sharply. In response, the UK Government has enacted a stimulus package in an attempt to prop up the economy in what is expected to be the biggest recession in living memory. But amid the gloomy outlook for the nation’s finances, I see at least one positive. Many quality FTSE 100 shares are trading on cheap valuations as a result of the sell-off in equities.

Cheap FTSE 100 shares Right across the , many companies are trading substantially below their average historic valuations. To me, this suggests there is significant value to be had. What’s more, despite the dismal outlook for the economy, a lot of these companies have taken the necessary steps to ensure their survival and continued prosperity once the pandemic subsides. In fact, some stocks have even thrived throughout the coronavirus period. I expect many could continue to do so even throughout a UK recession.

With that in mind, now may be an ideal time to buy FTSE 100 shares and hold them for the long term. Pick wisely and the bargain shares you invest in today could deliver attractive returns that help to finance your early retirement!

Ones to watch On my watchlist are a handful of companies that look oversold to me, and therefore undervalued.

For example, oil and gas “supermajor” Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) has seen its share price fall by around 41% since the start of 2020. The stock has taken a beating thanks to collapsing oil prices and the pandemic. However, I think Shell is well positioned to withstand a prolonged negative impact on business. This is primarily thanks to its mammoth cash reserves and healthy liquidity. Once the world economy recovers, demand for oil should, in theory, return to pre-pandemic levels. With such a dirt-cheap valuation (P/E: 7.9), I find it hard not to classify the company’s shares as undervalued.

After falling by 16% in the depths of the sell-off, GlaxoSmithKline shares now sit level with their pre-crash valuation. With group sales rising 19% and profits up by 14%, full-year guidance remains unchanged. As a defensive stock, I reckon GSK shares will fare well regardless of the extent of the UK recession. Earnings have thus far proven resilient, allowing the company to announce a 19p dividend for the quarter. With healthcare giants such as GSK set to play an ever-important role in an ageing population, I think a P/E ratio of 13.4 is more than justified.

Finally, shares in the leading British supermarket Tesco (LON: ), which trade at a P/E ratio of 12.6, look like great value to me. The food retailer’s dominant market position (30% market share) and healthy margins are impressive. What’s more, of all the supermarkets listed in the index, I think Tesco has the strongest growth potential. This can be seen in its expanding online services and acquisition of the wholesale operator Booker. A dividend yield of 4% further sweetens the deal.

Get rich and retire early In my view, all three of these quality FTSE 100 shares have the potential to deliver attractive returns over the long term through a combination of share price appreciation and dividend payments. As such, they could prove to be indispensable in your path to achieving financial freedom.

5 straightforward reasons to pass on an investment

SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio DGE -0.91% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio NFLX +0.50% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Nobody said life would be easy – especially not if you’ve chosen the life of a stock picker.

These days efficient investing can be a five-minute decision. Buy a diversified basket of index funds, check in on them once a year to ensure your allocations haven’t got out of whack, and spend the rest of your time bingeing on Netflix (NASDAQ: ) / at the beach / at work / bingeing on Netflix at work wishing you were at the beach. Those of us who do still invest in individual companies – whether because we fancy trying to beat the market for higher returns, or just because we love the challenge – know we’re signing on for much more work. From analysing company fundamentals to reading trading updates, monitoring the economic news, and standing in front of High Street stores trying to decide if what you’re looking at is the next big thing – the job of an active investor is never done. However we don’t need to make it even harder than it already is. I believe there are shares that none of us should invest in, and I believe many of us have our own additional landmines or no-go areas we should steer clear of.

Rather than agonise over the pros and cons of such ‘opportunities’, I say skip them and move on to one of the many thousands of other candidates just a click away these days. To kick start your own don’t-touch list, here are five types of investments that have me shouting “Next!”

1. You don’t understand what the business does This is very common with high-flying technology companies. You ask somebody what the business does, and at best they recite a few buzzwords they got off the first page of the annual report – or from an investment forum or magazine, or even from Twitter. Then they point out the share price has doubled. Sure, a profit is a profit. But if you don’t really understand how a company makes its money, how can you assess how well it’s doing, how big the opportunity is, and what the shares might be worth? You might as well bet on a racehorse.

2. There’s someone shady running the company You might be surprised how often the same dubious people turn up running companies, especially in the small-cap arena. Typically they’re charismatic promoters who persuade a gullible cohort that the last business went wrong for some reason outside their control, but never mind, they’re shooting for the moon this time. Pause for a moment and everything they say seems awfully confident for a micro-sized business that’s losing money and is ignored by serious investors. Very occasionally you’ll miss a profitable opportunity if you avoid everyone your gut warns you away from, and of course there’s an element of subjectivity here – one man’s Elon Musk is another man’s P. T. Barnum. But given all the great companies out there run by straightforward people, you don’t need to get chummy with charlatans.

3. It seems too good to be true Most of us know you shouldn’t put your savings into a product promising 10% a year ‘guaranteed’ when interest rates are barely positive, let alone listen to any boiler room puff-peddler on the phone. But even sophisticated stock pickers can be sucked into believing so-called ‘blue-sky’ stories that disappoint year after year. The management isn’t crooked, but they do see the world through three pairs of rose-tinted glasses. I recently read a report from a small cap whose technology the chairman boasted the world could not do without. Really? Then why is his company losing millions and why has its share price crashed from nearly £2 to barely 2p in just five years? Perhaps the world can live without it, after all.

4. The company offends your principles Life is too short and full of care to make money from an investment that stops you sleeping at night. In a nearly two decade-long investing career I’ve lost money more ways than I care to remember. But at least I’ve never lost sleep thinking about somebody dying of lung cancer and knowing I made money from a tobacco stock.

That is a personal decision. You might say smoking is legal, so what’s the problem? And I respect that view. But equally, you might be terrified for the future of your children given the climate crisis and so avoid the likes of Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) or maybe you saw a family member bankrupted by a gambling addiction that steers you away from William Hill. I have a barrister friend who blames most of society’s crimes on alcohol. He won’t touch a drop of Diageo (LON: ). I’m not here to preach. I’m simply saying that if you want to stick with your company through thick and thin – or even just assess it rationally – then it will greatly help if you don’t hate the business it’s in.

5. You’re not investing for investing’s sake Finally, a catch-all category that causes more investing misery than you might suppose. These are investments made not because you love the business, nor even because you love the price you’re paying for the business but because…

…your friend told you to invest and you want to keep them happy

…everyone else has already made money in it and you’re afraid of missing out

…you believe it can make the world a better place, even if it loses money for you

…you hate the company and you’ve already lost half your money on it but you want the price to double before you will sell and move on

…a myriad other reasons!

Picking winning shares is hard enough without these complications! Always remember the market doesn’t care why you invested in a company, what price you paid, or where you need a share price to get to breakeven – or indeed anything else except what the majority of people will pay to own its shares right now. You should own a share because you like the business and you like the price it’s trading at. Save the rest for supporting – or even betting – on your sports team!

Building a second income? Here are 2 FTSE 100 dividend stocks I’d buy and hold today

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio IMB +1.29% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LCO -0.16% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

A regular passive income from stocks is a notable way of growing your wealth. Building a portfolio of high dividend shares creates a regular second income at a much higher annual rate than bank investments.

The current ultra-low interest rate environment means the gains you make from holding dividend stocks are greater than ever before. But, many FTSE 100 companies are suspending or cancelling dividends because of coronavirus-induced reductions in revenues.

With this in mind, I’ve found two top FTSE 100 companies still paying great dividend income.

BP (LON: ) dividend The current BP (LSE: BP) share price of 341p provides for a dividend yield of 10.5%. The oil major has so far shown no sign of cutting its dividend, unlike rival Shell (LON: ). But, even if it does, the market has been speculating on a cut long enough for it to be already accounted for in the share price.

In addition, oil prices appear to be stabilising. is now above $40 a barrel for the first time in nearly three months on the belief the world is beginning to emerge from lockdown. Oil stockpiles are falling and OPEC+ are close to agreeing a short extension on supply cuts. This is good news for BP’s 20% stake in Russian state oil producer Rosneft.

The BP share price, trading at a current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.7, is slightly above the industry average of around 16. However, the company boasts a solid credit rating and the financial flexibility to help with these tough times. In addition, BP is aiming for a breakeven point of $35 per barrel during 2021, helping with profitability. The market clearly expects more from the oil major than from other oil firms.

A FTSE 100 stalwart FTSE 100 stalwart Imperial Brands (LON: ) (LSE: IMP) has also kept its dividend. However, Imperial has rebased its policy, so payouts may vary depending on profitability. Usually, this means a dividend cut but in Imperial’s case, its earnings are reliable meaning its profits should be too.

In any case, boasting a dividend yield of 13%, even after a hypothetical 50% cut, Imperial remains a top FTSE 100 dividend payer. And if that’s not enough, the tobacco firm maintains plans to return excess cash to shareholders via share buybacks.

Moreover, Imperial is a cash-conversion machine. In 2019, it converted 95% of its operating profits into cash. Its business has stayed strong throughout the coronavirus pandemic which encourages high-profit expectations for the rest of the year.

Both these FTSE 100 firms boast strong fundamentals and good dividend growth history, Imperial in particular. Financial markets appear bullish about the prospects of both. Indeed, Imperial currently trades on a P/E of 16.5, about average for the industry.

Despite this, both companies offer good rates of return, especially when compared with the rest of the index. Reinvesting these dividends and compounding the return is definitely the best way to build a second income.

I think Imperial and BP offer two of the best opportunities for passive income on the FTSE 100 right now. I’d buy and hold both today.

I think there’s never been a better time to buy these 3 FTSE 100 income stocks

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio IMB +1.29% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio TW +1.14% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

I exaggerate slightly when I say there’s never been a better time to buy these three income stocks. That’s because we could actually have bought them cheaper in March when the Covid-19 crash was at its worst. But I’m not trying to time it precisely, because that would be a mug’s game.

My first choice is oil giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB), which announced a dividend cut at the end of April. That was the first time Shell had reduced its dividend payment since the Second World War. So what am I doing choosing it among my FTSE 100 income stocks?

The cut has helped push the Shell share price considerably lower than that of fellow FTSE 100 oil firm BP (LON: ). It’s down 40% so far this year, while BP shareholders have seen only a 28% drop – and their dividends are unaffected so far.

The oil price is back nudging $40 per barrel, and I’d be very surprised if it doesn’t end the year significantly above that. That makes me confident that Shell’s dividends will return to their former strength. And that buying now will set up even better yields in the long term.

Ironically, perhaps, I think Shell’s short-term dividend cut will make it a better long-term income stock.

FTSE 100 income stocks The second of my FTSE 100 income stocks is housebuilder Taylor Wimpey (LSE: LON: ). Now, you might think this choice is even crazier, as the firm has suspended its dividend altogether. The final payment for 2019, plus a planned special dividend payment, have both been canned.

Taylor Wimpey explained it as part of its emergency strategy to preserve cash, which has also included directors’ pay cuts. The company, however, did say that its ordinary dividend “has been stress tested and is payable though a ‘normal’ downturn“. As FTSE 100 income stocks go, that’s positive.

May did bring the biggest fall in UK house prices since the financial crash. But I don’t think that’s anywhere near as bad as it seems, as so many transactions have simply not been able to take place.

I reckon in a couple of years, with Taylor Wimpey’s dividends back to strength, investors who didn’t buy will be ruing a missed opportunity.

A 10.6% yield The third of my FTSE 100 income stocks for today is still paying dividends, so maybe I’m not quite mad. It’s Imperial Brands (LSE: LON: ).

The Imperial Brands share price is down 20% since the start of 2020, a bit worse than the FTSE 100’s 16% fall. But its shareholders are still enjoying a handsome dividend to compensate. Imperial Brand shares are on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of under 6. That’s well below half of the FTSE 100’s long-term average. And well below what I’d expect from top FTSE 100 income stocks.

With the share price so low, the forecast dividend for the year to September would yield a huge 10.6%. It would be down quite a bit on the 2019 payment. And first-half results released on 19 May did show a fall of around 11% in adjusted earnings per share (at actual exchange rates). The company is also focusing on strengthening performance.

But I think the share price has fallen way beyond what this pessimism deserves.

By Joe Brock

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The energy industry's bet that a petrochemicals boom would support decades of oil and gas sales growth is on shaky ground as an already saturated plastic market is hit by a coronavirus demand shock.

While soaring demand for personal protective equipment and takeaway food containers has boosted sales of some plastics, it is likely to be only a temporary spike, say analysts.

In the longer term, a virus-led hit to economic growth in Asian, African and Latin American markets threatens demand at a time when the industry is already facing bans on single-use plastic that are spreading across the world.

Plastic resin prices, which have been declining over the past two years, have plunged further since the coronavirus hit, an added challenge for investments of hundreds of billions of dollars in petrochemical capacity over the past decade.

""The petrochemicals world has been hit by a double whammy,"" said Utpal Sheth, Executive Director, Chemical and Plastics Insights at data firm IHS Markit.

""Capital investment has been slashed by all companies. This will delay the projects under construction and new projects.""

Inc (N: ) said in April it would idle three U.S. plants producing polyethylene, the base for plastic bags and bottles.

Thailand's PTT (BK: ) and South Korean partner Daelim (KS: ) have indefinitely delayed an investment decision on a $5.7 billion project in Ohio, three industry sources said. The companies did not respond to request for comment.

A massive Pennsylvania plastics project, owned by Shell, that President Donald Trump touted during a visit last year faces risks of oversupply and a low price outlook, an energy industry report said on Thursday.

Dow and oil majors Exxon Mobil (N: ), Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), Chevron (N: ) and BP (L: ) declined to comment on demand forecasts for this story.

MARKET TROUGH

Still, there are 176 new petrochemical plants planned for the next five years, with nearly 80% of those in Asia, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Many plants under construction or late in the planning stages can't be rolled back without incurring massive losses.

Exxon in April kicked off construction on a $10 billion project in China, while Shell and state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp last month approved the expansion of one of the country's biggest ever petrochemical complexes.

Chinese firms are reviving a $20 billion project in eastern Shandong province to help support a flagging economy, Reuters exclusively reported this week.

""Even before the coronavirus outbreak, we were already expecting to see various petrochemical value chains ... heading into an oversupply situation,"" said Catherine Tan, principle analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

Significantly reducing the wave of new capacity would take years, raising the chances of a prolonged plastic price slump, industry sources said.

ENVIRONMENT FEARS

As they come under financial strain, some plastic producers have requested rescue funds from governments, while industry groups have lobbied lawmakers to roll back bans on single-use plastic, arguing it protects people from disease and germs.

The U.S. Plastic Industry Association wrote a letter in March to the U.S. Department of Health calling for a reversal of plastic bag bans, arguing that single-use plastic was the safest way to transport and package food.

However, a New England Medical Journal study in March found the coronavirus was still detected on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and .

With the price for virgin, or non-recycled, plastic now at historic lows and oil demand withered, environmentalists fear that producers will pump out cheap plastic to stoke demand and soak up some of the global glut of cheap oil and gas.

Plastic waste is already piling up in parts of Asia as people use more disposable packaging under coronavirus lockdowns, and recyclers struggle to operate.

""We will see a flood of plastic waste. Even if that wave isn't sustained, the plastic that gets pushed out now will pollute the planet for decades,"" said Carroll Muffett, head of the Center for International Environmental Law, an NGO.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/pandemic-exposes-cracks-in-oil-majors-bet-on-plastic-2133762,0.07,0.879,0.051,-0.8546

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) and Murphy Oil Corp (N: ) began evacuating non-essential workers from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on Thursday because of the threat from Tropical Storm Cristobal.

Shell said its production and drilling operations in the U.S.-regulated northern Gulf were unaffected despite the evacuations.

Gulf Coast spot gasoline prices remained steady, traders said. Gulf CBOB gasoline traded on Thursday at 12.50 cents per gallon below the futures benchmark ( ), little changed from Wednesday.

The storm's impact on prices at the pump is expected to be limited because of the loss of demand from the COVID-19 pandemic, said an analyst with Gas Buddy.

""We aren't expecting an impact on gas prices from Cristobal at this time given its relatively weak forecast,"" said Patrick De Haan at Gas Buddy.

Five companies are removing workers from the Gulf because of Cristobal, which is forecast to pass through offshore oil production areas before striking the Louisiana coast by Monday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.

BP Plc (L: ) said on Wednesday that workers were being evacuated as it shuts in production at its Thunder Horse, Na Kika and Atlantis platforms. The company is also pulling non-essential workers from the Mad Dog platform, but production was unaffected.

Norwegian state-oil company Equinor ASA (OL: ) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (N: ) began evacuating non-essential workers on Wednesday. Equinor plans to shut the Titan platform on Friday, if necessary.

The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port LLC (LOOP), Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ), Chevron Corp (N: ) and Hess Corp (N: ) said their operations were normal.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) said it has suspended operations at its Bajada de Añelo site in Argentina's Vaca Muerta area after seismic activity in the region.

Shell, which operates the block along with local state oil firm YPF, said in a statement late on Saturday that the preventative suspension of activities came after seismic movements were registered in an area of Argentina's Neuquén province near the Andes mountains bordering on Chile.

""We are evaluating the information available and the evolution of the situation over the weekend to decide on Monday how to continue. We will resume activities when we consider that conditions are appropriate,"" Shell said in a statement.

Shell operates other areas in Vaca Muerta, a huge region of unconventional hydrocarbons including the Cruz de Lorena, Sierras Blancas, Aguila Mora, and Coirón Amargo Suroeste blocks. The firm did not mention any other suspensions.

By Erwin Seba

HOUSTON (Reuters) - As oil and gas companies began shutting offshore production before the first tropical storm of the season in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, experts said restarting wells and refineries will take longer and prove more costly this year because of COVID-19.

Well shut-ins typically last a few days or weeks at most, but oil companies have adopted stringent virus precautions for refinery and offshore staff, including frequent health checks, travel restrictions, onsite protective gear, and longer work stints with pre-departure quarantines.

More time-consuming evacuations and slower restarts could lengthen post-storm recoveries, and potentially deliver a knockout blow to small offshore facilities, said William Turner, a vice president at research and consultancy Welligence Energy Analytics.

""There is an economic hit when a hurricane comes through,"" said Turner, and for smaller producers strained by low prices a bad storm may be the last straw for their production.

""Some assets won't be worth turning back on,"" he said.

U.S. energy companies face their first test of hurricane restarts under COVID-19 this week from the approaching Tropical Storm Cristobal. Three have already evacuated workers and shut some production.

National Hurricane Center forecasters expect up to 19 named Atlantic storms this year with three to six becoming major hurricanes, above the average 12 storms and three major hurricanes.

STORM AIMS FOR OIL FACILITIES

Cristobal is expected to enter the central Gulf this week, an area rich with offshore platforms, and could see landfall along Louisiana's refinery row on Sunday.

Gulf Coast refineries and seaports account for 45% of U.S. oil processing capacity and the majority of energy exports. Some 1.93 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil, or 15% of the U.S. total, also comes from U.S. Gulf of Mexico waters.

COVID-19 already has raised costs and added travel headaches for offshore crews and complicated working conditions for refinery operators. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) hired helicopters to individually ferry out three workers on the same platform suspected of having the virus to isolate them from one another, said a Shell spokeswoman

Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ) recently required a repair crew to quarantine for two weeks before allowing them to access its Destiny platform off the coast of Guyana, the country's Environmental Protection Agency chief, Dr. Vincent Adams, told Reuters

""Repairs have been necessarily delayed in order to observe travel restrictions and safety and isolation protocols related to COVID-19,"" said Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler.

Some 120 offshore Gulf of Mexico workers have tested positive for the virus this year, and a greater number were evacuated preemptively, according to a National Ocean Industries Association spokesman.

Chevron Corp (NYSE: ) and others have lengthened offshore crew schedules to at least 21 days from 14, closed gyms and staggered meal breaks to reduce the risk of coronavirus outbreaks. Workers who spike a fever or exhibit signs of illness are whisked off for onshore medical care.

Post-hurricane restarts will also change. BHP Group quarantines employees heading to its offshore platforms in a Louisiana hotel and expects workers evacuated from rigs during storms to stay at the same or another onshore hotel until the danger passes and they can return to the platform.

Under normal circumstances, ""we do not expect the challenges associated with COVID-19 to significantly impact our production deferrals,"" said BHP spokeswoman Judy Dane.

MASKS IN CONTROL ROOMS

At Gulf Coast refineries, the crews assigned to remain onsite during a storm will wear masks if they cannot be six feet (1.8 metres) away from another person while working at control boards, a person familiar with the matter said.

The ""ride-out"" team will also have temperature checks before entering the facility, and be required to self-report any symptoms of the illness, the person said.

""CDC-recommended guidelines and safety practices, including daily self-health assessments, limited gathering sizes, social distancing, wearing masks where appropriate, will remain in effect at our refineries,"" said Lillian Riojas, spokeswoman for Valero Energy Corp (NYSE: )",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/oil-refineries-offshore-drillers-face-hurricane-challenges-amid-pandemic-2133724,0.058,0.884,0.058,0.0699

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Norway's Equinor ASA (OL: ) and Anglo-French firm Perenco are among at least five oil producers that have registered coronavirus cases among employees or contractors at facilities off the coast of Brazil, according to industry and regulatory sources.

Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L: ) and Brazil's Enauta Participacoes SA (SA: ) have registered one case each, and hundreds of cases have been recorded at oilfields operated by state-run Petrobras (SA: ).

The infections illustrate the threat the virus poses to workers toiling in cramped quarters miles offshore and have raised questions about the effectiveness of extensive testing efforts to contain the pandemic's spread on platforms.

Alongside industries like mining and meatpacking, oil production has come under intense scrutiny during the pandemic as employees are forced to work, sleep and eat in confined areas.

That is particularly true on offshore oil rigs, service vessels and so-called ""floatels,"" where a single infection can multiply quickly.

In most other nations, outbreaks have been contained to a handful of rigs. U.S. industry group National Ocean Industries Association said it had registered just 99 cases of coronavirus among offshore workers in the United States, according to data shared with Reuters last week.

In Brazil, which last week became the country with the second highest number of coronavirus cases after the United States, that number is significantly higher.

Oil regulator ANP had registered 544 active coronavirus cases as of Thursday among workers who had accessed offshore facilities. That figure does not include workers who have recovered and the total number of infections remains a mystery.

Equinor has registered approximately 60 cases as of last week, largely at its Peregrino field, according to a source with direct knowledge of data collected by regulators and a source with knowledge of the company's operations.

Perenco has registered approximately 40 at its Pargo field, according to the government source and a source with knowledge of the company's operations.

Asked about the issue, Shell and Enauta told Reuters they have each registered one case.

In a statement provided to Reuters, Equinor acknowledged that it had registered cases but did not provide details of how many. Perenco declined to confirm or deny that any employee had been infected by the virus.

All four companies emphasized their commitment to protecting workers.

Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA: ), as Petrobras is formally known, has registered well over 300 cases among offshore workers, including contractors, the government source said.

The company has acknowledged infections, and said that as of Saturday it had 181 active cases among all of its 46,416 total employees, but that number does not include contractors or employees who have recovered.

The company said it has adopted several safety measures such as large-scale testing, and that the number of cases has stabilized in recent days.

ALL MEASURES TAKEN

Many oil firms are ramping up universal testing and mandating long quarantine periods among workers before they go on board platforms and sterilizing platforms. Yet that has not been enough to contain all offshore outbreaks.

The infections at Equinor's sprawling Peregrino field, its largest international production asset, spread through workers doing construction work at a new oil platform and the outbreak occurred in multiple waves, the two sources said.

At times, efforts to contain the virus have led Equinor to suspend some construction operations, they said.

The company told Reuters that workers were infected ""despite all the preventative and proactive measures"" taken.

Shell said that its one employee tested positive for the virus upon disembarking from a vessel hired by the company and was in quarantine. No other workers appeared to have been infected, it said.

Enauta said one of its contractors had contracted the virus and has since recovered.

Petrobras has been unable to provide universal testing for workers and contractors before going on board platforms, upsetting unions.

According to the government source and a fourth source with knowledge of Petrobras operations, testing has rolled out at different paces in different regions of Brazil, partially impeded by difficulties finding labs willing and able to process the results.

A Petrobras spokeswoman told Reuters the company has been ramping up its testing capacity as market availability allows, and now tests all workers before they embark except in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte.",https://uk.investing.com//news/coronavirus/exclusive-coronavirus-spreads-in-brazils-oilfields-as-five-offshore-operators-register-cases-2126868,0.043,0.903,0.055,0.3912

Covid-19 has changed the game for FTSE dividend investors. Here’s how I’d build an income portfolio today

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BARC -0.62% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LLOY -0.41% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio PRU -2.47% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio DGE -0.91% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio AV -0.90% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SGE +1.58% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ULVR -0.47% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SN -0.82% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BT -0.71% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

It’s fair to say the outlook for FTSE 100 dividend investors has changed dramatically in recent months due to Covid-19. Only a few months ago, investors could rely on well-established FTSE companies to provide them with a steady stream of dividends. And the yields – which were often 5%, or higher – were excellent.

Today, however, the situation is very different. Over the last few months, over 40 companies in the have suspended or cancelled their dividends, due to Covid-19 disruption. Meanwhile, plenty of other companies have reduced their payouts.

There’s been plenty of big-name casualties. For example, oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), which hadn’t cut its dividend since World War II, recently cut its quarterly payout by a huge 66%. Meanwhile, income favourites, such as Lloyds Bank, Barclays (LON: ), BT Group (LON: ), and Aviva (LON: ), have all suspended or cancelled their payouts.

This suggests to me that dividend investors now need to be much more selective with their dividend stocks. The days of being able to hold a struggling, debt-laden FTSE 100 company, such as BT Group, and pick up a big 5%+ yield look to be over.

So, what’s the best way to build a dividend portfolio now then?

Building a FTSE dividend portfolio today If I was putting together a dividend portfolio today from FTSE stocks, I’d focus predominantly on high-quality businesses. Specifically, I’d look for companies that:

Have genuine long-term growth prospects

Strong competitive advantages

Aren’t highly cyclical, meaning they’re able to generate relatively consistent profits and cash flows throughout the economic cycle

Aren’t drowning in debt

Have a dividend growth track record of at least five, if not 10, consecutive dividend increases

Have a dividend coverage ratio (the ratio of earnings per share to dividends per share) of at least 1.5

High-quality businesses Finding these types of companies isn’t easy. But I’ve highlighted a selection of FTSE companies that generally meet this criteria:

Unilever (LON: )

(LON: ) Reckitt Benckiser

Diageo (LON: )

(LON: ) Sage

Prudential (LON: )

(LON: ) Smith & Nephew (LON: )

Note that none of these companies offer a huge yield. The average among them is about 2.7% (still relatively attractive, compared to the abysmal interest rates on savings accounts).

Yet what they do all offer is reliable dividends. And that’s what you want as a dividend investor.

Not one of these companies has suspended, cancelled, or trimmed its dividend in the wake of the coronavirus disruption. That’s impressive. There’s no guarantee they won’t cut them in the future, of course but, in my view, there’s a relatively low chance of that happening.

I’ll also point out that all of these companies have the potential to deliver dividend growth going forward. That’s a real plus, as dividend growth tends to lead to healthy total returns (capital gains plus dividends) over time.

The key to dividend investing So, that’s how I’d build a dividend portfolio today. I’d focus less on high-yield stocks and more on high-quality FTSE stocks that have attractive long-term growth prospects.

These kinds of stocks are more likely to maintain, and grow, their dividends over time. And that, ultimately, is the key to success when investing for dividends.

The has had a great week, rising well above where it was just a few weeks ago. Hopes around treatments for Covid-19 coupled with the lifting of restrictions globally, have fuelled investor optimism. That’s despite the short-term pain likely to be felt by higher unemployment and business failures.

FTSE 100 shares With share prices still far below where they started the year, it’s not too late for investors to catch further gains. There’s a risk, however, of a second spike of Covid-19, which investors should be wary of. History shows there’s a risk of a double-dip.

Nonetheless, for a long-term investor, the FTSE 100 has great companies trading at cheap valuations. In an age of negative interest rates, options for making your money grow are becoming harder to come by. Furthermore, the risk of a double-dip in the short-term is far from certain.

Investing in some of the UK’s most established companies could be very profitable. It can be done through a tracker, otherwise known as an ETF. These are cheap and don’t require much research. Or you can take more risk and buy shares in individual companies.

Another way to invest in many FTSE 100 companies is through an investment trust, which is run by a professional. This provides access to a larger number of holdings. These can often trade at a discount to their net asset value, so you get the shares for less than they should really be worth.

FTSE 100 dividends There’s been no lack of news recently about listed companies suspending or cutting their dividends. Shell (LON: ), for example, massively reduced its dividend for the first time since the Second World War.

Depending on the economic recovery, however, there’s potential for dividends to be reintroduced, often from a more sustainable level than they were pre-coronavirus. Or, even without the reintroduction of dividends in the near term, there’s plenty of potential for capital growth from FTSE 100 shares. Many are now on very low price-to-earnings ratios.

It’s also worth remembering many companies are still paying a dividend. Some sectors are better than others for keeping dividends, so if income is important then consumer goods companies such as Unilever (LON: ) could make for a good investment as could utilities and supermarkets. Demand for their products isn’t going away, regardless of what happens to the economy.

Ultimately, I think FTSE 100 shares at the moment carry some risk but also a lot of potential for upside. This is why I prefer them to gold or bitcoin as an investment and hold a number myself, including Persimmon (LON: ), National Grid (LON: ), and Legal & General, to give just three examples.

Many FTSE 100 shares now trade on low P/Es, indicating they are cheap. Even looking at the economic data it’s clear governments are doing a lot to keep economies going and that’s helping share prices. This is why I think investing in solid FTSE 100 companies for a long time has the potential to make any investor far richer. Maybe even to make millions.

Is the Shell share price worth buying?

SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio CL -0.21% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio USO +0.21% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

The income part of my portfolio has been taking a hit this last month or so, there’s no getting around it. While I feel that share price declines because of Covid-19 are for the most part likely to bounce back, income is always less certain. So I was disappointed when at the end of last month Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) said it would be cutting its dividend for the first time since the Second World War.

Not a short-term measure The cut to the dividend of two-thirds came, of course, as oil and energy prices collapsed on the back of coronavirus and overcapacity. If this was the only problem, and I thought the reduced dividend would be short lived, I wouldn’t have too much concern. However Shell has indicated otherwise.

CEO Ben van Beurden has said that the reduction is in fact part of a “reset” of the company’s dividend policy. Not what we investors wanted to hear. What’s more, Beurden said this was just the early part of a “fundamental shift for Shell over the next 30 years”.

One thing I have always liked about Shell as an investment is the company’s adaptability. Specifically, they have been fairly adamant about the need to adapt as the world moves away from oil and fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources.

I am of the opinion that a real, practical shift is a long way off yet, but perhaps we are witnessing the first fundamental shift in policy for an oil major.

Oil prices That said, is of course, still Shell’s main business, and that won’t be changing anytime soon. Low oil and gas prices then, are what we really need to consider.

Beurden has warned “We do not expect a recovery in oil prices or demand for our products in the medium term”, and the International Energy Agency has said worldwide energy consumption could fall 6% this year.

Despite this however, I can’t help but feel there is a slight hint of panic in the air with regards to crude prices. As always, greed and fear drive prices far more than fundamentals, and I think the true weakness in the oil price market triggered a knock-on panic, particularly with paper sales (futures contracts on exchanges rather than physical crude oil itself).

OPEC is due to meet at the start of June to consider ways of “stabilising the world oil market” – a phrase that usually hints at production cuts from its members.

That said, things are fast becoming too uncertain for me in the oil market, at least in terms of fresh investments. I am certainly holding on to the oil stock I have, but I am curious to see how the next few months pan out before I put any more money in this sector.

As the Covid-19 pandemic worsened two months ago, share prices started slumping. Worse still, many companies halted cash dividends. Even members stopped funnelling cash to investors, including household names such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and HSBC.

This is not the death of FTSE 100 dividends Of course, share returns are made up of capital growth plus dividends. The good news is that, since hitting its 2020 low on 23 March, the FTSE 100 has bounced back strongly. It has leapt almost a fifth (20%) from below 5,000 to almost 6,000 today.

However, I firmly believe that focusing on dividends now could yield bumper future returns. For me, strong companies that continue to pump out dividends in these troubled times stand out from the rest of the herd.

Of course, when a company cancels, cuts or defers dividends, it doesn’t harm the underlying business. Indeed, by keeping this cash and preserving capital, many firms will be better positioned in a post-Covid world. Personally, I’d much skip a few dividends than lose my capital in a busted business.

Big dividends from a ‘boring’ company While investors sit tight and wait for share prices to recover, many need to generate more income from their distressed portfolios and spare cash. As a margin of safety, I’ve been focusing my attention on FTSE 100 dividend giants, such as Vodafone (LON: ).

Seeking out a combination of sheer size and high, solid and consistent dividends, I came upon Rio Tinto (LSE: LON: ). This is very much a ‘boring’ company: it’s the world’s third-largest mining companies, boring big holes into the earth to extract metals and minerals.

Rio Tinto (‘red river’ in Spanish) was founded in Britain in 1873, but today has dual listings in the UK and Australia. Many of its mines, smelters and refineries are situated in Australasia, Canada and developing countries. It digs up and sells iron ore, aluminium, , diamonds, titanium, gold, and borates for crops.

To give you an idea of its global size and scale, Rio employs 46,000 workers across 60 operations and projects in 36 countries. It has 2,000 customers and 37,000 suppliers worldwide.

As for its financials, Rio’s current share price of 4,268p values it at £70 billion, propelling it to #5 in the FTSE 100 heights. In the latest financial year, earnings per share of 399p puts Rio on a modest price-to-earnings ratio of 10.7 and a tasty earnings yield of 9.3%.

Rio’s main attraction for me is definitely its dividend. The latest full-year payout of 350.6p (including special dividend) equates to a fat dividend yield of 8.2%. Brokers expect this payout to be trimmed in 2020, lowering the yield to around 7.7%. It’s worth noting that earnings cover the dividend only by a modest margin. But that’s because Rio is a veritable cash machine, distributing almost all of its earnings to shareholders as cash dividends.

In summary, for income-seeking investors, Rio Tinto offers an attractively high yield, while its shares have held up well, falling by a mere 7% over the past 12 months. Not bad for a ‘boring’ company!

(Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plans to lift the coronavirus lockdown from more retailers drove a 1.2% rise in the blue-chip FTSE 100 ( ) on Tuesday, while an easing of curbs on tourism helped travel stocks.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) rose 3.3% to its highest close in more than 2-1/2 months after Johnson said Britain will reopen thousands of high street shops, department stores and shopping centres next month.

""The consumer will need to do the bulk of the heavy lifting so confidence to get out of the house and start to live a normal life will be critical to this recovery,"" Stephen Innes, markets strategist at AxiCorp, said.

The retailers index ( ) rose 4.5%, closing at its highest level since early March.

Travel and leisure stocks ( ) ended at a near one-month high after Spain said it would allow some foreign tourists from July and Germany was reported to be considering ending a travel warning for parts of Europe.

The FTSE 100 has recovered sharply from its March sell-off and is now on course for its biggest two-month percentage gain in two years. But it remains about 19% down on the year, with macroeconomic data pointing to a deep global recession.

Aston Martin (L: ) shares surged more than 27% after the luxury carmaker said Mercedes-AMG CEO Tobias Moers would become its chief executive in August.

Oil and gas stocks ( ) also rose, tracking crude prices on optimism that a revival in business activity would bring back demand for the commodity. [O/R]",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/reopening-hopes-power-london-shares-aston-martin-soars-2126702,0.04,0.908,0.052,0.548

Stock market crash: I’d buy these 2 FTSE 100 recovery stocks to get rich and retire early

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LCO -0.16% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

The stock market crash is throwing up bargains everywhere you look. Despite the recovery, plenty of companies are still available at dramatically lower prices. I’m tempted by oil majors BP (LSE: LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB).

I’ve picked out these two FTSE 100 stalwarts because they’ve endured two meltdowns. The coronavirus crash, and the oil price collapse. In both cases, the worst is over, for now. Despite this, both are way cheaper than at the start of the year.

The BP share price has crashed This makes now an appealing entry point for those looking to build a portfolio of FTSE 100 shares large enough to help them retire early.

The BP share price started 2020 trading at around 480p. Today, you can buy it for 306p. That’s a thumping 35% drop. It’s the same story with the Royal Dutch Shell share price. It started the year trading at 2,258p. Today, it stands at 1,242p. That’s an even bigger drop, of 45%.

Just because a FTSE 100 company’s share price has crashed, doesn’t automatically make it a bargain. At one point, crude producers were paying people to take their shipments. That was due to the crash in demand as economies went into lockdown, and the surge in supply as Russia and Saudi Arabia turned on the spigots to destroy US shale.

Today, trades at $35 a barrel. Coincidentally, that’s BP’s targeted break-even price for 2021, down from $56 in 2019, according to chief executive Bernard Looney.

Analysts at Redburn recently put Shell’s breakeven point at a more demanding $65. I’m therefore not surprised the group was first to blink, by cutting its dividend for the first time since the war.

The Royal Dutch Shell share price is cheaper For me, BP has the edge on two fronts. Right now, the FTSE 100 giant yields a barnstorming 10.57%. That’s an astonishing income, especially when you consider all the dividend cuts elsewhere. You can take that tax free inside a Stocks and Shares ISA.

BP stood by its dividend despite a 67% drop in first-quarter profits. Dividends are never guaranteed, but even if management halved the payout, the stock would still yield 5%.

Shell looks cheaper, trading at 7.91 times earnings, against BP at 19.5 times. You have to take traditional FTSE 100 valuation metrics with a pinch of salt these days, but it’s a pointer.

FTSE 100 shares will build your wealth The big question to consider with both FTSE 100 oil majors is where oil goes next. Renewables will continue to get cheaper, squeezing oil. Both companies will want to expand in this area, while looking to drive down carbon emissions from other activities. This will cost.

If you want to buy these two FTSE 100 oil stocks to fund your retirement, I would recommend doing it while they look relatively cheap. Like today.

In early 2020, stock markets were hitting all-time highs and investors still had their innocence. Then the coronavirus crisis overwhelmed the world and the cracked, crumbled, and then crashed.

The FTSE 100’s steepest crash On 17 January, the FTSE 100 hit 2020’s high of 7,675, up 1.7% in 17 days. In late February, the index began what proved to be its sharpest crash in history. Bottoming out on 23 March, the FTSE 100 limped along at 4,994, more than a third (35%) below its 2020 peak.

The FTSE 100 Covid-19 shake-up Covid-19 has caused complete upheaval in the FTSE 100, particularly among the upper echelons. For years, the top spots among UK market mega-caps were dominated by big, familiar household names. Global giants such as oil firms Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and BP (LON: ), and mega-bank HSBC once dominated the top table of the FTSE 100. Four months on and everything has changed, perhaps permanently.

Today, BP clocks in at £62bn and Shell hovers around a £100bn valuation. The FTSE 100’s #1 is drug firm AstraZeneca (LSE: AZN), while its close rival, GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK), has leapt to fourth place.

AZN v GSK: Which would I buy? As pharma firms are now #1 and #4 in the FTSE 100, I decided to pit them against each other. Here’s how our two contenders shape up:

Here is AstraZeneca in a nutshell:

Share price: 8,915p | 12-month price change: +51.7% | Market value: £113.5bn | Price-to-earnings ratio: 103.1 (forecast to fall to 27) | Dividend yield: 2.5% | Dividend cover: Not covered

And now GlaxoSmithKline:

Share price: 1,679p | 12-month price change: +9.2% | Market value: £84.5bn | Price-to-earnings ratio: 15.7 | Dividend yield: 4.75% | Dividend cover: 1.34

Astra has had a rip-roaring rise, with its shares rocketing by more than half in 12 months. Apparently priced at over 100 times earnings, strong earnings growth will see its shares fall to a more modest rating of 27 in 2020. Do note that Astra’s 2.5% dividend yield is lower than the FTSE 100 average and not presently covered by earnings (as yet).

GSK shares have risen less than a tenth in the past year and are modestly priced at under 16 times earnings. Furthermore, its chunky annual dividend of 80p – held steady for four years – offers a dividend yield of 4.75%, almost twice Astra’s. Also, GSK’s dividend is covered 134% by earnings, giving room for manoeuvre and scope for growth.

For me, GSK comes out on top every time in this ‘heavyweight pharma title’ bout. Indeed, I’ve owned GSK shares for almost three decades. Conversely, Astra’s meteoric rise to the peak of the FTSE 100 reminds me of the myth of Icarus. He flew too close to the sun and crashed back to earth. For me, despite its attractive drug cupboard and strong future pipeline, Astra’s shares are too highly priced for my portfolio!

Top British stocks for June 2020

We asked our freelance writers to share the top British stocks they’d buy in the month of June. Here’s what they chose:

Royston Wild: Centamin Share indices might be off March’s multi-year troughs but the going is tough. Key economic gauges continue to shock, suggesting that while the bottom has already been plumbed we should expect a long (and possibly bumpy) recovery in global GDP.

It could well pay to remain invested in safe-haven stocks like Centamin (LSE: CEY), then. Investors in the gold mining giant would have greeted the yellow metal’s rise to new seven-year peaks above $1,750 per ounce in May. The hair-raising rhetoric that has emerged between the US and China in recent weeks has helped the hard currency to keep rising and should continue driving prices, too.

At current prices Centamin deals on a forward P/E ratio of 14 times. It carries a bulky 4% corresponding dividend yield, too. I reckon it’s a top British stock pick for June.

Royston Wild does not own shares in Centamin.

Rupert Hargreaves: Unilever (LON: ) The global economy is reeling from the coronavirus crisis, and right now, it’s difficult to tell which companies will survive. With that in mind, I think Unilever (LSE: ULVR) is an excellent investment for the current market.

The company is one of the world’s largest consumer goods producers. It owns a range of multi-billion-pound brands, which have a substantial consumer following.

Demand for these products may dip over the next few weeks, but should grow over the long term. A dividend yield of 3% also adds to the stock’s appeal.

The recent market sell-off could be an excellent opportunity to buy this global consumer goods champion at a discount price.

Rupert Hargreaves owns shares in Unilever.

Matthew Dumigan: Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) The Royal Dutch Shell (LSE: RDSB) share price has taken beating in the stock market crash thanks to a collapse in oil prices and the outbreak of Covid-19.

However, the industry titan looks well-placed to withstand the pressure of plunging profits over a prolonged period. Moreover, once the world economy recovers, demand for oil should swiftly return to pre-pandemic levels.

Looking ahead, substantial investment into renewables and clean energy could deliver attractive returns to investors.

Of course, holding for the long term is necessary. But with such a cheap valuation, I find it difficult not to classify shares in Shell as undervalued.

Matthew Dumigan owns shares in Royal Dutch Shell.

Kevin Godbold: Bunzl (LON: ) specialist international distribution and services company Bunzl (LSE: BNZL) posted some decent first-quarter figures at the beginning of April. Revenue rose, and underlying trading had been robust in the areas of safety, grocery, healthcare, cleaning and hygiene. However, Covid-19 has been negatively affecting the roughly 35% of revenue from the foodservice and retail sectors.

Meanwhile, governments have “increasingly” designated Bunzl as a critical supplier, enabling the firm to play an “important” role in the coronavirus crisis. I reckon the company is well placed to thrive in a world featuring the virus, and this top British stock could continue its recovery during June as lockdowns ease.

Kevin Godbold does not hold shares in Bunzl.

Anna Sokolidou: Polymetal Polymetal International (LSE:POLY), the second-largest gold producer in Russia, has been steadily growing its sales revenue and profits for several years.

The Covid-19 crisis will continue to have a negative effect on many countries’ economic indicators. This will force many central banks to keep the interest rates next to zero. This, in turn, will put upward pressure on gold prices.

84% of Polymetal’s revenues come from selling the . So, the correlation between gold and Polymetal’s shares is really strong.

However, gold itself does not pay any dividends or interest, whereas POLY yields about 4% in dividends.

Anna Sokolidou has no position in Polymetal.

Kirsteen Mackay: Auto Trader I think the Auto Trader (LSE:AUTO) share price will increase in June as UK lockdown restrictions are eased. As car showrooms reopen, they will get back to paying to advertise on Auto Trader and as people get back to work, they will return to buying and selling vehicles. Auto Trader’s revenues are linked to the number of cars being advertised on its website.

Its price-to-earnings ratio is 25 and earnings per share are 21p. It has been hurt by the lockdown and offered free listings to keep big advertisers on board and to give customers at home plenty to browse. I think the second-hand car dealing market will increase as the country slides into recession.

Kirsteen does not own shares in Auto Trader.

Edward Sheldon: Computacenter (LON: ) My top British stock for June is Computacenter (LSE: CCC). It’s a leading provider of technology solutions to businesses and public sector organisations.

I expect Computacenter to benefit from Covid-19 disruption. While digital transformation has been on the agenda for many businesses for years now, the disruption we have experienced recently is likely to push them to embrace it wholeheartedly. Already, the FTSE 250 company appears to be benefiting. On 15 May, the group said that the first half of 2020 will be “considerably ahead” of the same period of last year.

CCC shares currently trade at a very reasonable valuation. I believe now is a good time to be buying.

Edward Sheldon has no position in any shares mentioned.

Jonathan Smith: IG Group Despite the broader being down for the year, IG Group (LSE: IGG) has seen a share price rally of 12.4% over the same period. The retail stockbroker and spread-betting firm makes higher revenue during volatile times due to increased client activity.

In a April trading update, the firm announced 22,500 new accounts had been opened in Q2 already, compared to 36,000 in the previous three quarters.

If existing clients are trading more and a large number of new clients are coming onboard, then it is only a matter of time before we see a spike in revenue and profits.

Jonathan Smith does not own shares of IG Group.

Tezcan Gecgil: Marston’s My top choice for June is pub operator Marston’s (LSE: MARS). It is currently the UK’s largest brewing business, with six breweries and eleven distribution centres. It also has 1,400 pubs, restaurants, cocktail bars and inns.

In late May the share price skyrocketed. Management announced that the group will merge the brewing business with Carlsberg (CSE: ) UK to form Carlsberg Marston’s Brewing Company. Investors were delighted.

Needless to say, the hospitality trade, including pubs, has suffered greatly since the lockdown that began in March. And that decline in business has been reflected in the share price. Despite last week’s run up in price, year-to-date, MARS shares are down close to 50%.

The industry is hopeful as of July most pubs will be able to welcome guests again. And such grand opening can only help support the stock.

I’d buy the dips.

Tezcan Gecgil does not own shares in Marston’s.

Tom Rodgers: Dart Group With air bridges likely opening between the UK, Portugal, Greece and Spain, all eyes are now turning towards a recovery in UK travel shares.

The AIM-listed airline operator Dart Group (LSE: DTG) owns Jet2 and its main routes are to Europe and the Mediterranean. Dart is bound to get a boost pent-up travel demand.

It has a P/E ratio of just 7 and is highly profitable: bosses said full-year 2020 profits would be 49% ahead of 2019.

There’s also plenty of room to rebound: its share price gained 119% in 2019 but now sits at 63% cheaper than pre-Covid.

Tom Rodgers currently has no position in Dart Group.

Roland Head: Royal Mail (LON: ) It’s been a difficult year for Royal Mail (LSE: RMG), but I think the postal operator’s shares now trade at a level that offers serious value for patient investors.

The recent departure of chief executive Rico Back suggests a more dramatic shake-up of the group’s operations is now likely. Changes are needed to accelerate the shift from letters to parcels, but I believe that with new leadership the business should rise to this challenge.

In the meantime, I think shareholders can take comfort from the group’s £3.1bn property portfolio — nearly twice its £1.8bn market cap. I reckon June is the time to buy this top British stock.

Roland Head does not own shares in Royal Mail.

Andy Ross: Reckitt Benckiser Shares in Reckitt Benckiser (LSE: RB), owner of cleaning products like Dettol and health products such as Nurofen, have momentum. The shares, over just the last month, are up over 10%. I expect this momentum is being driven by investor demand for companies that will benefit from Covid-19 – which, as an FCMG company focusing on health and hygiene, Reckitt Benckiser surely will.

That coupled with the potential for dividend growth, at a time when higher-yielding shares are cutting investor payouts, makes the shares attractive.

There’s a risk the rapid increase in the share price means there could be a correction. Though often, momentum can be maintained and that’s what I expect to happen in June.

Andy Ross owns shares in Reckitt Benckiser.

G A Chester: Capital Gearing Trust Capital Gearing Trust (LSE: CGT) remains my top buy for balancing near-term risk and long-term reward. Results last week for the year ended 5 April showed a 0.1% increase in NAV per share versus a 24.8% fall in the MSCI UK Index. In the spring market crash, the NAV suffered a maximum decline of 9.9% between 20 February and 19 March, while the UK equity market plunged 32.8%.

The trust’s defensive positioning, with a mix of equities and lower-risk assets, means it should perform relatively well in the event of further market stress. Meanwhile, its 8%-a-year return since 2000 is a not-to-be-sniffed at long-term performance.

G A Chester has no position in Capital Gearing Trust.

Peter Stephens: Reckitt Benckiser Reckitt Benckiser’s (LSE: RB) recent trading update highlighted the progress it is making against key long-term objectives.

For example, it is investing in new technology to access e-commerce growth, while seeking to position its portfolio to capitalise on long-term growth trends such as an ageing world population.

The company’s stock price has moved higher this year, which means that it trades at a premium to many of its index peers. However, its recent sales growth and diversity could make it an attractive long-term buy during an uncertain period for the world economy.

Peter Stephens owns shares in Reckitt Benckiser.

Manika Premsingh: Burberry Group (LON: ) FTSE 100 luxury fashion brand and retailer Burberry (LSE: BRBY) has been hit hard by Covid-19 and the stock market crash. Its recently released financials show a fall in revenue. But it continues to remain profitable.

With China on the mend, it could have somewhat better times in store during the second half of the year. Even though luxury spending can take a hit as the global recession sets in, it’s well-established brands like BRBY that should be able to weather it. Its share price has already risen 35% since March 23, when the FTSE 100 touched its bottom. I think it’s a top British stock for June.

Manika owns shares of Burberry Group

Paul Summers: Codemasters Group The recovery in markets has been remarkable but I remain cautious, particularly as we’re getting closer to when companies will be required to provide actual numbers on just how bad trading has been. To mitigate this risk, my pick is video game developer and lockdown beneficiary Codemasters Group (LSE: CDM).

While there’s no guarantee that it won’t fall along with everything else in the event of a second market crash, the mid-cap is already trading at a discount to industry peers. For 17 times forecast earnings, new buyers will get a company with no debt, lots of cash and an eagerly anticipated new game coming in August (Fast & Furious Crossroads). All this before even considering the great growth prospects for gaming in general.

Paul Summers has no position in Codemasters Group.

By Kate Abnett

(Reuters) - Europe's second highest court on Wednesday rejected a challenge by the operators of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines against European Union gas rules, saying it was up individual member states to enforce them.

Nord Stream 2, designed by Russia's Gazprom (MM: ) to increase direct shipments to Europe, will carry gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea.

The Swiss-based operating company Nord Stream 2 had said the EU rules, which require separate companies to build, operate and own pipelines, would weaken the basis for funding the project. It turned to the courts to annul a relevant EU gas directive amendment adopted last year.

The general court on Wednesday dismissed the challenge, saying the directive amendment did not directly affect the pipeline and responsibility for enforcing the relevant EU law lay with the member states.

""Concerning both Nord Stream 2 AG and Nord Stream AG, the General Court finds that they (the companies) are not directly concerned,"" the court said in a statement.

Nord Stream 2 said it was analysing the ruling and had the option to file an appeal within two months.

""The court has not rejected our claim on substance, in particular that the amendment of the Gas Directive constitutes an unlawful discrimination of Nord Stream 2. Therefore, we maintain our claim,"" it said in a statement.

Germany's energy regulator on Friday declined to grant a waiver of the directives for the section that runs through German territory.

Nord Stream 2 is wholly owned by the Russia's Gazprom, and is responsible for the planning, construction and operation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to open around early 2021 after numerous delays.

Fifty percent of the funding is provided by Germany's Uniper (DE: ) and BASF's (DE: ) Wintershall unit, as well as Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), Austria's OMV (VI: ) and France's Engie (PA: ).",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/eu-court-throws-out-challenge-from-russianbacked-nord-stream-2-2123877,0.025,0.938,0.037,0.128

£5k to invest? I’d buy the Shell share price for income today

SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Management’s decision to cut the company’s dividend sent the Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) share price plunging when it was announced a few weeks ago.

This was the first time the stock, which was a staple in income investors’ portfolios, had cut its dividend since the end of the Second World War.

But while the Shell share price’s yield is now no longer as attractive as it once was, the stock still stands out as an income investment. As such, it could be a great addition to your income portfolio today.

Buy the Shell share price for income Shell’s dividend cut caught many investors by surprise. Many income investors might have preferred the company to maintain its dividend, even if it meant selling more assets or borrowing more money.

But the cut makes a lot of sense. It will save Shell an estimated $10bn a year. Management can use this cash to reduce borrowing or invest in operations. It could also open the door to share buybacks and special dividends if profits exceed expectations.

And even after the cut, the firm remains an income champion. The Shell share price currently supports a dividend yield of more than 4%. That’s significantly more than most companies in the current environment. It’s also considerably higher than the best savings account interest rates on the market today.

Growth potential What excites me is what Shell might do with this extra cash. The company remains one of the world’s largest oil producers, but the planet is slowly moving away from hydrocarbons. Shell needs to invest in the future if it wants to remain relevant, and using the cash to build its renewable energy business could be a sensible decision.

The company could also use the funds to buy struggling peers. This would give it better economies of scale and even more pull over global energy markets. This may be a big positive for the Shell share price.

These initiatives could help improve the company’s earnings growth over the long term. This would be a sensible trade-off — exchanging short-term income for long-term capital growth.

The company can also use the money to reduce debt. This would increase the appeal of the Shell share price from a risk perspective. Paying down debt would help the group cut production costs further, and improve profit margins.

All of the initiatives above should help the business grow over the long term. So, while the recent dividend cut might be disappointing for short-term income investors, it could translate into attractive capital growth over the long run.

As such, now could be a great time to buy the Shell share price for income. A dividend yield of 4% is attractive in the current environment, and this could rise steadily over the coming years as the company re-deploys capital into growth initiatives.

If you are worried about the outlook for oil and gas, owning the Shell share price as part of a well-diversified income portfolio may be the best option.

Forget the recession! I’d look to these FTSE 100 survivors for wealth generation

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio TSCO +0.04% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio JMAT -0.72% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ABF -0.67% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SN -0.82% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Hearing the word ‘recession’ can send fear coursing through your veins and dread flooding your body. What is to become of us all as we head for the worst recession the world has known in modern times?

As desperate as things are, the stock market is not going anywhere, and businesses are doing their utmost to buckle up for an eventful ride ahead. So I think investors need to think logically and long term when choosing the stocks to invest in. As the old saying goes: “Fortune favours the brave”. Therefore, those brave investors who choose stocks wisely will be rewarded in years to come.

Original FTSE 100 constituents The FTSE 100 launched in 1984 and of the original constituents, I favour the following companies. Below are businesses I think will continue to stand the test of time and get through the coronavirus recession.

So which firms make my list? Associated British Foods (LON: ), BP (LON: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), GlaxoSmithKline, Reckitt Benckiser, Tesco (LON: ), Johnson Matthey (LON: ) and Smith & Nephew (LON: ).

Some are riskier than others and the road ahead may not be smooth. For instance, the oil price is set for further volatility, which will constrain BP and Shell. Tesco is facing increased overheads, and online competition caused by the pandemic. Meanwhile, Associated British Foods is losing money with the closure of its Primark stores.

I do not see any of these companies going out of business though, so as far as long-term investments go, they are among the better choices available.

Cultivating a long-term mindset When you buy a share, you become a part-owner of that business, sharing in its future profits and growth. Keep this in mind when you are looking for stocks to buy. Consider the company, its financial stability, its potential for growth and its staying power. Is it providing something that is in demand? Is it at risk of being outpaced by competitors?

As companies scale back production and job losses mount, investors should look to the companies best prepared to weather the pandemic.

Fear and greed can prevent you from investing wisely. Fear of missing out can make you buy stocks you later regret, and greed can cause you to get carried away on a stock-buying spree. Equally, fear can stop you from investing at all.

If you can turn a blind eye to short-term price fluctuations, a carefully chosen stock will pay off in the long term. Many company valuations are below their long-term averages, which makes them attractive buys. Some of the world’s most successful investors, including Warren Buffett, follow this tried and tested strategy.

Although past performance cannot guarantee future performance, it can act as a guide. Those FTSE 100 companies that have been constituents since the beginning have survived so far, and I am convinced many of them will still be around 10 years from now.

Have £20k in your ISA to buy FTSE 100 shares? Here’s what I’d do {{0|now}}

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio EZJ -1.51% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ICAG -0.55% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Having a Stocks and Shares ISA is a no-brainer for the vast majority of private investors, even if they just want to stick with shares. After all, any profits you make, or dividends you receive within this account, won’t be taxed. That’s a big positive when you consider the life-changing power of compound interest coupled with the fact that you can currently put up to £20,000 to work in the markets every year.

So, what sort of strategy should someone adopt if they have the full allowance to invest but only want to pick from the UK’s biggest companies? Here’s my take.

Buy ‘quality’ FTSE 100 shares While it’s too soon to know the full economic cost of the coronavirus, one way of mitigating its impact on your wealth is to seek out quality stocks.

Now, it would be a mistake to assume that all FTSE 100 shares are worthy of your cash. A company can be huge (and trading on a cheap valuation) and yet actually be a very poor investment if, say, it operates in a crowded sector. Poor earnings growth, high fixed costs, and big debts can also hold it back.

My preference, therefore, is for companies with great brands, sound balance sheets, and/or large market shares. I’m also looking for firms that earn above-average returns on the money they invest in their businesses. Think of this as their own ‘interest rate’, just like you’d get with a savings account. Anything above 20% or so, gets my attention.

This is why I own a stock like Rightmove. It’s suffering in 2020, but I’m confident that boasting the above qualities will help it bounce back, in time.

Diversify (but not too much) Buying quality still counts for little if you’re only investing in one or two parts of the market. You don’t need me to tell you how horrific 2020 has been so far for those companies operating in the airline sector (easyJet (LON: ), IAG (LON: )) and the oil industry (Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), BP (LON: )). Spreading your cash around is prudent.

Having said this, it’s also a fact that the more FTSE 100 shares you hold, the more closely your portfolio will resemble the index. That’s problematic, because the goal of stock-picking should be to beat the return of the index, not replicate it. You may as well buy a cheap exchange-traded fund, accept the market return, and do something else.

Another reason for buying only your best ideas comes down to management. The larger your portfolio, the more time and energy you’ll need to expend staying in touch with your holdings.

Expect volatility Pick up any financial paper at the moment and you’ll get a mish-mash of people saying that stocks will hang on to their recent gains and others saying that we’re heading for another leg down. To save you pondering things any further than you need to, I can confidently say it’s pretty much impossible to know with any certainty.

What I think we can expect over the next few months is volatility. This being the case, it may be worth investing your money in installments. Pound-cost averaging (investing the same amount on a monthly basis, for example) into FTSE 100 stocks is psychologically much easier than investing all in one go.

Dividends have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. In total, £30bn worth of company dividends have either been cut, or deferred, AJ Bell calculates. Tobacco giant Imperial Brands (LON: ) is the latest to cut its shareholder payout.

Yet income-seekers shouldn’t despair. Plenty of companies continue to stand by their dividends, despite the meltdown. This may be a sign of financial strength, and a good indication of which stocks you should consider buying today.

We love dividends on Motley Fool. That’s because if you reinvest them back into your portfolio for growth, they could ultimately drive half your total returns over time.

Dividends can make you rich Before the pandemic, the FTSE 100 was yielding as much as 4.5% a year. It will be roughly half that today. There may be further dividend cuts on the way, now the government has banned firms using its loan scheme from paying them.

Don’t despair though. By targeting companies that remain committed to paying dividends this year, you can get a much higher level of income. AJ Bell personal finance analyst Laura Suter says 140 companies have committed to maintaining £12.3bn in dividends in the coming year. “This includes 26 FTSE 100 firms, including BP (LON: ), Vodafone Group (LON: ), GlaxoSmithKline, Diageo (LON: ) and Tesco (LON: ), meaning income investors still have options,” she noted.

So this isn’t the end of the world for dividends seekers. Especially since those five FTSE 100 companies all offer juicy deals.

Five FTSE 100 income favourites Oil major BP currently yields an incredible 10.18%. It has yet to cut, in contrast to rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ). The oil price rise could now come to its rescue. In 2019, BP’s breakeven oil price was $56 a barrel. After a cost-cutting drive, it’s aiming for $35 next year. After the recent recovery, now costs $36 a barrel. So fingers crossed although, as ever, there are no guarantees when it comes to dividends.

Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline yields 4.77%. Operating in the healthcare sector, it has some immunity to current pressures. Glaxo’s dividend has always been one of the most attractive on the FTSE 100. It looks even more so today.

Global telecommunications provider Vodafone halved its dividend, but its payout survived its recent full-year results. Despite last year’s cut, you still get a juicy yield of 6.19%.

Spirits giant Diageo is never the biggest yielder. Today you get 2.42%. Management regularly increases the payout though, giving you a rising income. This is one of my favourite FTSE 100 dividend stocks. People have carried on drinking during the lockdown, and I don’t expect them to stop once they are set free.

Tesco is the great turnaround stock. It’s also one of the heroes of the pandemic, after keeping the food deliveries coming. Chief executive Dave Lewis has stood by its payout, and it currently yields 3.9%.

Dividends are dead? These five FTSE 100 stocks show there’s still plenty of life, if you know where to look.

Market crash: time to buy cheap FTSE 100 shares?

Since the start of the year, the market crash has caused the to fall by 21%. Coronavirus and the subsequent damage it’s expected to cause to the global economy weighs heavily on investors’ minds.

There are signs of a slight rebound, however. The index has increased by 20% since its low on 23 March.

With reports in the media about the next recession, investors might be holding off buying shares in the belief that the market could fall once again.

Market crash Any recovery for the FTSE 100 might indeed be followed by another market crash.

Share price fluctuations in the short term are notoriously difficult to predict. Even the greatest investors, like Warren Buffett, admit that it’s impossible to determine what will happen in the next few weeks, months or years.

Pound-cost-averaging Instead, it’s normally better to invest with a longer outlook. By spending decades in the market, buying shares and reinvesting dividends, compound interest will have a chance to work its magic. This could help investors ride out the bumps and crashes along the way.

I think investors should consider trying to lower their risk by pound-cost-averaging. This can be achieved by setting up regular payments to purchase selected shares or funds. Investments might then be made when the market rises and crashes, but you’ll be able to buy the largest amount of shares when they’re cheap. Therefore, the returns to the investor will average out over time.

Historically, stocks and shares have tended to perform better than other assets over the longer term.

Cheap FTSE 100 shares The latest market crash means that some quality companies are trading at a low valuation. For example, shares in Unilever (LON: ) have fallen by 3% in the year-to date. This drop means its stock is now trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 18. With brands like Marmite and Ben & Jerry’s in its portfolio, I believe that customers will still purchase its products even when the going gets tough.

And I’d focus on valuation rather than dividends (for now). Many companies in the FTSE 100 have suspended or cancelled dividends payments. Even Shell (LON: ), previously loved by income investors, cut its dividend for the first time since World War II. Consequently, I’d rather buy stocks for the recovery potential than income prospects. That is why I’d buy cheap FTSE 100 shares in this market crash.

For investors anxious in these uncertain times, it’s helpful to look back at the history of the FTSE 100. Although the past might not repeat itself, it’s comforting to note that despite multiple crashes in its 36-year history, the market has recovered in the long term each time. Fellow Fool Peter Stephens has noted that in the past, the best buying opportunities have often coincided with the greatest periods of uncertainty.

Benjamin Graham, the mentor of a young Warren Buffett, said that investors must “believe in a better tomorrow”. Although we’re faced with unprecedented times, today’s investors really should believe that things can get better when they consider buying shares!

My 5 tips for picking UK dividend stocks in this Covid-19 crisis

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio FTMC -0.21% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Many UK dividend stocks have disappointed income-hungry investors this year. Shareholders have seen an unwelcome rash of cancelled, suspended or reduced payouts. This is because most companies are desperate to hang on to cash. The reason, of course, is the huge economic distress and uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

With oil giant Shell (LON: ) having cut its dividend for the first time since World War II, it’s tempting to wonder if any company’s payout can be relied on. However, I think there remains plenty of potential in the market for income investors. Selectivity is required, I’d suggest. Here are my five tips for improving your chances of picking UK dividend stocks with sustainable payouts.

Reset your yield expectation on UK dividend stocks We’ve seen historically unprecedented low interest rates and massive quantitative easing over the past decade. With so much ‘cheap money’ floating around, many companies were able to maintain otherwise unsustainably extravagant dividends by borrowing. The yield of the UK’s reached a level relative to yields on 10-year British government bonds unheard of in 120 years. My first tip for picking UK dividend stocks is to take the yields of recent years as a historical anomaly. This means resetting your general yield expectation to a lower level.

Exceptions to the rule? Are you sure? Many of the highest yields on UK dividend stocks have already disappeared. However, some remain. As ever, this means the market is deeply sceptical about their ability to maintain their payouts at the prevailing levels. Unless you’re very confident these super-high yielders have special qualities that make their dividends sustainable, I’d avoid them.

Assume conditional largesse from lenders My third tip for picking UK dividend stocks also falls into the avoid category. I’d steer clear of any company that hasn’t yet suspended its payout, but is in negotiations with its lenders for higher borrowings and covenant waivers, and/or is looking to access government-backed loans. I’d say it’s prudent to assume any largesse by lenders will be conditional on the suspension of the dividend.

UK dividend stocks I’d consider Following my avoid tips leaves a still-reasonable-sized pool of UK dividend stocks in the FTSE 100 that have maintained their payouts. Their average yields may be lower than the minimum you demanded in the recent past, but this goes back to my first tip to reset your yield expectation lower. As well as these companies that have maintained their payouts, I’d suggest it’s also worth considering those that have rebased their dividends in response to the Covid-19 crisis, and have a policy of progressive growth from the rebased level.

Look beyond the FTSE 100 Finally, my fifth tip is to consider UK dividend stocks outside the FTSE 100. The blue-chip index is the traditional hunting ground for income-seeking investors, but there are a fair number of companies in the second tier (and even some small-caps) well worth considering. I’d say the best of these operate in resilient industries, with business models that are well-equipped (in some cases designed) to deliver reliable dividends for their shareholders.

Hopefully, my five tips will help improve your chances of picking UK dividend stocks with sustainable payouts. There are still plenty around!

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) has begun drilling the Saturn block in the Santos pre-salt basin, the company's Brazil chief said on Thursday, adding that Brazil faces hurdles to remain attractive in a low-price environment.

Brazil's No. 2 oil producer after state-run Petroleo Brasileiro (SA: ), Shell is the operator of block with a 45% stake, along with Chevron (N: ), also at 45%, and Ecopetrol, with 10%. The consortium won the block in a 2018 auction.

André Araujo, speaking during a live broadcast streamed by newspaper Valor Econômico, said the company had also this year started drilling the Gato do Mato area, operated by Shell in the Santos Basin. He gave no details.

Araujo stressed that the global oil industry scenario is challenging and that Brazil faces regulatory challenges to remain attractive, with a new level of prices ahead. He said oil firms will have to adapt to a scenario of lower investments and ""without a doubt, investments will migrate to those countries and projects that are more attractive.""

Brazil's pre-salt layer is a ""strategic area of ​​great interest"" and ""extremely productive,"" Araujo said. But he also said the industry would get more competitive and some players may begin allocating investment to other forms of energy.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-has-begun-drilling-saturn-offshore-block-brazil-chief-says-2124889,0.051,0.877,0.072,0.618

Why the FTSE 100 crash makes me want to buy oil shares today

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio TLW +2.13% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HBR +0.79% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Since the start of 2020, the crash has knocked 20% off the value of top UK shares. A barrel of oil has crashed to around $35, and a whole bunch of explorers and producers are under threat yet again.

The industry is in a particularly pessimistic state right now, and I can certainly see why investors might stay away. But the FTSE 100 crash has brought back to me one of Warren Buffet’s best-known pieces of advice. We should, he urges, “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful“.

I’ve no idea how long oil will stay this cheap. It could be for quite some time. Industry will surely get back to normal eventually, but transport could be changed for the long term. And there’s a very good chance that some oil companies will go bust. That’s especially as, at current prices, there are some whose costs of production and debts mean they’re struggling to make ends meet.

Oil survivors Oil supply and demand must come to balance once again, at a price that’s profitable for whichever companies survive the FTSE 100 crash. So, how can we avoid Buffett’s famous first rule of investing, to “never lose money?“

I think one way is to find oil companies that are profitable at current oil prices. Another is to look for strong balance sheets, ones that are good enough to make it through the crisis. I would definitely avoid companies in the middle, without the needed balance sheet strength, and struggling at current prices.

So for me, Premier Oil (LON: ) and Tullow Oil (LON: ) are right out, falling far further than the FTSE 100 crash. Both are under the pressure of massive debt piles. And the extra cash flow from $60 oil that was helping chip away at that debt has vanished. So far this year, the Tullow share price is down 62%, and Premier oil is down a painful 70%.

If they survive, they could make very profitable recovery buys. But the risk is way too high for me.

FTSE 100 crash survivors At one end of the options scale, I’d place the big two, BP (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ). Last month, shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War II. And that is a sign of how serious things are.

But I have little doubt that BP and Shell will survive the FTSE 100 crash and the oil price slump. Or, if things become so bad that they don’t, we’ll have far more important things to worry about than our investments. Their share prices are down, with BP losing 35% and Shell 45%.

I think that actually makes them better recovery candidates than Premier or Tullow. Not such big falls to potentially claw back, but a lot less risk.

Small and profitable At the other end, there’s tiny Gulf Keystone Petroleum. Now, Gulf’s shares are down a whopping 65%. And with full-year results in April, we heard the firm has suspended its expansion and is moving into defensive mode.

But, Gulf does not have the debt problems of some of its peers. The firm reported $164m in cash at 22 April, with no debt payments due until 2023. So maybe avoid the FTSE 100 crash altogether. I think Gulf Keystone could be offering the best risk-to-reward ratio of them all.

(Bloomberg) --

Saudi Aramco (SE: ) is the first major global oil producer to see its stock recover to the level it traded at before the price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Aramco climbed 3.1% in Riyadh on Tuesday, advancing for a record sixth day alongside an extended increase in the price of crude. The stock has gained each session since the company announced it would retain dividend payouts, despite a drop in first-quarter profit.

Aramco’s recovery has been achieved on much smaller share volumes than its international counterparts, with less than 2% of the Saudi company’s stock available for trading. An average of about $35 million worth of Aramco shares changed hands each session last week, rising to $100 million on Monday. That compares with yesterday’s Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). share turnover of $1.4 billion.

Much of Aramco’s stock sold during its initial public offering in December went to locals, who stand to receive bonus shares if they maintain their holdings for six months. The shares are now 20% higher than this year’s lowest close on March 16.

Shares in oil companies plummeted in March after an OPEC+ meeting ended without a deal to curb production, an impasse that was followed by an all-out price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted global energy demand as economies shut down, prompting a collapse in the oil market. Crude futures have since recovered as governments started to ease lockdown measures and after major suppliers eventually agreed to production cuts.

While Aramco stuck to its dividend plans, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc slumped last month after cutting its payout for the first time since the Second World War. Total SA (NYSE: ) offered to pay part of its final 2019 dividend in shares, rather than cash.

“While oil-output cuts across the world have helped push prices above $30 a barrel, we remain cautious about the pace of a recovery in oil demand and compliance with the OPEC+ pact,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Salih Yilmaz and Rob Barnett. They added that price volatility may persist, “given uncertainty over the relaxation of coronavirus pandemic lockdowns.”

Investing for long-term growth is something that I believe everyone should partake in, which is why I enjoy sharing my analysis on this website. At a rough estimate, I believe that I know nearly 3,000 stocks intimately, in particular in the UK and USA. I trade daily in vertical options and short positions. But for the last six weeks, finding good long positions in UK stocks has been so troublesome that I have been unable to recommend any in this column.

The challenge right now is not one of choices, but of timing. For all the talk of ‘buying the dip’ of 23 March, many of the gains driven by the FOMO-rally since March have since been wiped out again. Last week, prices in the UK have started looking very volatile. There is much talk from analysts about stock prices having become detached from the reality of the post-COVID economic outlook. stalwarts such as Barclays (LON: ) and Aviva (LON: ) have paused their dividends for at least the next year, with no guarantees they will return in 2021.

We are in unchartered territory with a real possibility that the UK market could become a bull trap: an ‘emperor’s new clothes’ scenario where investors who bought the dip in expectation of a quick recovery drove prices up into a self-perpetuating rally, only for the bullish emperor to be found to be naked and exposed as bad news, such as the extension of the Government furlough scheme until October, causes the hard economic reality to set in. Some prices are now reversing back to never-seen-before lows – and inflicting heavy losses.

A lot of conventional wisdom has been overturned too. Before the crisis, the compounding effect of investing in the low volatility of long-established FTSE 100 stocks with a regular and reliable dividend stream was almost a surety for long-term investment growth. Yet during the crisis it is non-dividend-paying ‘newbie’ growth stocks such as Ocado (LON: ) that have proven robust. Investors have rushed into tech as traditional dividend stocks have fallen sharply.

We also have heightened risk velocity, with a social-media-driven news cycle and the interconnectivity of globalisation increasing the pace at which fresh bad news or even an unforeseen ‘black swan’ event could negatively impact markets and trigger more sell offs.

Yet bullish optimism is also not entirely misplaced. People have short memories and life often has a way of confounding economists. We saw this in 2003 when global markets rebounded quickly after the shock of the SARS virus. And share prices today are significantly down from their pre-COVID 52-week-highs precisely because they are (theoretically) pricing in big drops in GDP, higher unemployment and growing acrimony between the US and China. Shell (LON: ) and BP (LON: ) have suggested, but not yet confirmed, that they intend to pay dividends. British American Tobacco (LON: ), GlaxoSmithKline, Rio Tinto (LON: ), AstraZeneca, Vodafone (LON: ), BHP and Imperial Brands (LON: ) are also forecast to continue to pay out their dividends in 2020.

Yet whilst I admire the fortitude of the bullish view, I find it very hard to share in its optimism. The only solution as I see it right now is to look for long-term stability. And this has piqued my interest in a FTSE 100 stock that may prove itself to be a sleeping giant: BT (LSE:BT-A).

Yes, BT has just axed its dividend for the first time in history. It has a huge £18bn liability arising from its debt and £50bn of pension liabilities. It must spend £12bn to upgrade its network in coming years. And prior to some false media reporting about its plans to sell off OpenReach at a valuation of £20bn, which caused the stock to rally, last week the price of BT was at historic lows with a market cap of only £10bn, down from £50bn in 2016.

Given its current low price I’m now closely watching BT as a prospect for a very long-term investment. A new tie up between O2 and Virgin to challenge BTs deep reach into 18 million UK households validates the future opportunity. But it will be very hard to shift BT from its entrenched position. BT is already very far ahead of competitors in introducing 5G, and has the scale and organisational memory to make full fibre a reality in every UK home.

This will become all-the-more important because of some imminent mega trends. In a post-COVID world, I predict that working from home, video conferencing and streaming entertainment will be endemic with near-total adoption across the full UK population. The world is also on track to connect 1 trillion sensors to the Internet of Things at the dawn of an artificial intelligence revolution that will change and impact every aspect of our lives. BT’s reliable 5G and full fibre internet connections will be absolutely crucial for all of this.

In my view, the world is changing in favour of BT. A major restructuring is already under way. BT could yet prove itself to be a sleeping giant and re-emerge next year as a dividend-paying growth stock. The question is exactly when this sleeping giant will awaken, and thus whether the right time to invest is now. At this low price, BT certainly looks tempting.

With the coronavirus outbreak still causing uncertainty in the market, now could be an excellent time to buy defensive shares.

The market is likely to remain turbulent for some time. Financial analysts are still trying to determine the impact that the virus will have on the global economy. With more uncertainty on the horizon, I think buying defensive stocks could be a great strategy to weather the storm.

Defensive dividend share Unlike other businesses, energy company SSE (LSE: LON: ) is committed to its dividend. In a recent trading update, SSE announced its board would be recommending a full-year dividend of 80p per share.

If the business maintains its dividend, I believe income investors who might be considering selling their positions in Shell (LON: ) or BT could seek out SSE shares.

The business acknowledges that there is a possibility that the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak may harm its results. It is a situation that the company is monitoring closely, but “has not so far had any material impact on SSE’s financial results for 2019/20”. As a clean infrastructure business, SSE might avoid the worst of the economic damage caused by the virus, unlike other industries.

As the demand for cleaner energy increases, I would expect this to have a positive impact on SSE’s revenue growth and profitability over the long term. This outlook will please buyers of defensive shares and growth investors alike.

SSE shares are currently trading with a prospective dividend yield of 7.5%. The business hopes to increase its dividend payments in the coming years to at least the rate of inflation. With SSE’s generous dividend and defensive nature, this could be a great share to buy and hold.

British American Tobacco (LON: ) Tobacco stocks have been out of favour with investors for some time, due to overall consumption declining in many places around the world. Of course, the volume of cigarettes sold will probably continue to decline in the future. So far, tobacco companies have managed this reduction in volume by increasing prices.

However, in a recent update, British American Tobacco (LSE: BATS) said it had a strong start to the year, with volumes increasing by 0.4%. Despite the ongoing uncertainties surrounding the impact of coronavirus, the company is committed to its high single figure earnings growth target for 2020. This will please buyers of defensive shares, who are on the lookout for stable earnings in times of economic uncertainty.

Despite this, its share price is down by 6% in the year-to-date. Consequently, the shares have a price-to-earnings ratio of 10.

In the future, BATs plans to increase margins further and to convert 90% of adjusted profit into operating cash flow. The group is conscious that customers will move away from cigarette products. It has an ambitious aim of reaching £5bn of revenue in its alternative tobacco and nicotine products.

With the slump in its share price and defensive qualities, now could be a great time to invest in the company.

(Reuters) - European shares bounced on Monday after their worst week in two months, as investors hoped for a gradual economic recovery with many countries easing coronavirus-led lockdowns.

Energy majors Total SA (PA: ), BP Plc (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) rose nearly 6%, leading market gains as oil prices climbed by more than $1 a barrel, supported by output cuts and signs of gradual demand recovery. [O/R]

France's Total was also boosted by news that it called off plans to acquire Occidental Petroleum Corp's (N: ) assets in Ghana, and agreed to buy up assets from Energías de Portugal (LS: ).

The pan-European STOXX 600 ( ) rose 2%, with bourses in Frankfurt ( ), Paris ( ) and London ( ) also rising more than 2%.

""The markets are heavily influenced by monetary policy and seem to ignore some longer-term threats,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior macro strategist at Rabobank.

""Technically also, the indexes have difficulty in reaching late-April highs. We've entered a phase where indexes will lose some strength.""

Governments and central banks globally have unleashed unprecedented stimulus to prop up the economy, helping the STOXX 600 recover nearly 25% from its March lows despite dire readings of business activity and rising U.S.-China trade tensions.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said over the weekend it would be a long road to recovery, but added the central bank was ""not out of ammunition"", pointing to the willingness to expand existing programs or add new ones.

Also raising hopes of a gradual return to pre-coronavirus levels of activity, shops, restaurants and hair salons prepared to reopen in Italy on Monday, while other centres of the outbreak such as New York and Spain gradually lifted restrictions.

French automakers Renault SA (PA: ) and Peugeot SA (PA: ) gained 3.2% and 2.8%, respectively, after finance minister Bruno Le Maire told a local radio channel the government was hoping to announce a plan within 15 days to help the country's automobile sector.

German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp AG (DE: ) jumped 4.5% after a source told Reuters it was in talks with international peers about consolidating its loss-making steel business.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI: ) jumped 4.1% after confirming its Italian unit was working with Rome to obtain state guarantees on a 6.3-billion-euro ($6.8 billion) loan facility.

Swedish radiation therapy gear maker Elekta (ST: ) surged 11.2% to the top of STOXX 600 after it won an order worth around $200 million and was set to exceed its target for bookings of its new radiation system Unity.

Global dividends could crash 30%+ in 2020! Why FTSE 100 investors need to be VERY careful

Income investing has become a minefield in recent weeks. Crashing corporate earnings and an uncertain outlook for the global economy in 2020 (and beyond) mean that dividends continue to fall across the and elsewhere.

The extent of the problem is reflected in a fresh Janus Henderson report released on Monday. In its latest Global Dividend Index, the asset manager predicts that total rewards could slump by as much as 35% (to $1.21trn) year-on-year in 2020. Even its rosiest estimates suggest that the worldwide total could drop 15% from 2019 levels, to $933bn.

In better news, Janus Henderson says that it expects dividends “to recover some of the lost ground in 2021.” But of course, payments will be coming from the lower base created this year. The pandemic will clearly take a heavy toll on investors’ income flows in the near term and after.

Bank dividends to bomb? Janus Henderson predicts that British companies will be some of the biggest dividend slashers on the planet too. It says that “the UK has a number of sectors whose dividend outlook is impacted by the pandemic.” It comments that “UK dividends are heavily reliant on a few very large companies, so the risk is very concentrated here”.

Take the banks as an example. On the one hand Janus Henderson notes that “banks in most major economies are in a stronger position this time around, and regulatory oversight is more robust,” compared to the last banking crisis. And banking dividends should therefore recover more quickly than they did during the 2008/09 crisis.

But recent Bank of England advice means that dividends from UK banks are on shaky ground. Janus Henderson notes that Threadneedle Street has requested that banks not pay dividends in 2020. It’s a development that will have huge ramifications for total dividends generated from these shores. FTSE 100 bank HSBC was the 10th best-paying share in the world in 2019, according to the asset manager. Lloyds and Barclays (LON: ) have also been generous dividend stocks in recent times, of course.

More danger… and what I’d do now Investors don’t just need to fear falling bank dividends, however. Threadneedle Street has asked insurance companies to keep a lid on shareholder payouts too, Janus Henderson notes. It adds that mining companies are highly-tuned to a sharp slowdown in the global economy. Footsie-quoted Glencore (LON: ) has already cut the dividend.

Janus Henderson also suggests that oil may finally reset payout policies in a landscape of lower energy prices. It notes that BP (LON: ) has held its payout, but that Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) has scythed its own dividend down by almost two-thirds. According to its figures, Shell was the number one dividend payer on the planet in 2019.

So should we all stop buying shares? Not at all! It’s clear that investors need to be more careful than usual when picking stocks to fund their income flows. It doesn’t mean, in my opinion, that they need to stop investing entirely. There are still plenty of stocks out there that could pay big dividends this year and beyond. And following bouts of fresh selling, there are many I would consider too cheap to miss right now.

Here are my top 3 investing ideas of the decade for navigating the FTSE 100 stock index

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio AZN -0.63% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio ITV -1.23% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio FTMC -0.21% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio OCDO -2.32% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio JSAIY -0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

As far as the new decade has gone so far, it’s not off to a great start. We entered 2020 on after a resounding election victory that meant Brexit uncertainty might soon end. The was also performing well, and the economy didn’t look close to a recession.

The Covid-19 pandemic quickly changed all of the above, and the FTSE 100 index is down around 25% year to date. But a decade is a long time, and we’re less than half a year into it. So for stock investors looking at the long term, below are my top three strategies for the decade.

Buy defensive Without wishing to start off overly gloomy, my first idea would be to buy defensive stocks. Defensive stocks are those that perform well during a downturn. This is usually due to the products/services offered being a necessity for consumers and being bought regardless of the economic performance. Good examples of this are supermarkets such as J Sainsbury (OTC: ), and healthcare firms such as Astrazeneca (LON: ).

My rationale for this long-term play is that we recently ended the longest stock market bull run in history. So it may take a few years to get up to the speed of gains we saw in the past few years. We may recover most of the losses from the pandemic in the next year, but having this cautious tilt to your stock portfolio will definitely help you to sleep easier.

Buy high growth The ‘exciting’ firms of today can often be the stalwarts of tomorrow. Now obviously, if you knew that certain growing firms would be profitable buys, you’d simply buy them all. But you can never know that and high-growth firms are riskier to invest in. In order to counterbalance this risk, mix your investments into half a dozen growth firms. This means that even if some fail to really break through in the decade, having one that does (and doubles the share price) more than makes up for it.

As examples, take a look at the story and growth behind Ocado (LON: ), Flutter Entertainment and Games Workshop (actually a firm). I wrote more about the merits of high-growth businesses here, and how they can aid early retirement.

Buy safe dividend stocks Until recently, most FTSE 100 firms were paying dividends, and exceptionally few had the need to cut them. Yet due to the pandemic, even income-paying stalwarts such as ITV (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) have slashed them.

For some firms, it will take a while before the board has enough confidence to resume paying dividends. So when looking at the next decade, it’s important to buy safe dividends wherever possible. Adding stocks that pay out dividends is vital to support your other strategies.

High-growth firms usually look to reinvest profits to support further expansion, and defensive stocks usually don’t offer high dividend yields. So seeking income is wise to support the other two ideas.

Overall, my top three themes for the decade aim to cover most scenarios. Now let’s sit back and see what happens!

(Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index recorded its strongest performance since late March on Monday as investors bet on a faster recovery from a coronavirus-driven recession.

The FTSE 100 ( ) closed up 4.3% after ending Friday with its first weekly slide in three. BP Plc (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) gained more than 8% each, as signs of higher demand drove oil prices to a one-month high. [O/R]

""Currently, it's very sentiment driven because it's all about reopening and rather than closing,"" said Stefan Koopman, senior markets economist at Rabobank.

""It feels like investors have a fear of missing out and they just want to join this rally. That's why it's very broad based and led by sectors that are most strongly hit by the shutdown.""

Precious metals miner Hochschild (L: ) jumped 12% after saying it would restart its Peru operations in the coming weeks.

Trillions of dollars in global stimulus helped the FTSE 100 rebound in April from a coronavirus-fuelled selloff in March, but gains in May have been tempered by growing evidence of the economic havoc already wrought by the health crisis.

A survey on Monday showed the number of Britons visiting shops collapsed in April due to a nationwide lockdown, while the head of the country's budget forecasting office warned UK economic output could have slumped more than 30% last month.

The banking index ( ) was among the smallest gainers of the day as a report cited the Bank of England's chief economist as saying the central bank was looking more urgently at negative interest rates to prop up the economy.

With the shutdown in economic activity putting millions out of work globally, investor attention will be on UK employment data due Tuesday, before turning to inflation and business activity data later in the week.

London-listed shares of Ryanair Holdings Plc (L: ) jumped 15.8% after Europe's largest low-cost carrier announced details of sharp cost cuts and promised a swift return to full capacity and expansion.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil companies may be facing uncertainty as the coronavirus pandemic triggers a collapse in demand for their products, but auto makers are betting the crisis will help accelerate an electric future.

With economies reeling from lockdowns to curb the virus, the sharpest plunge in oil prices in two decades has slashed the cost of filling up a tank of gas, eroding some of the incentive to make the switch to cleaner fuels.

Looking ahead, cuts in capital spending forced upon energy companies as their revenues crumble could tighten supply enough to cause a spike in oil prices, making electric vehicles more attractive just as automakers ramp up production, analysts say.

""We think this will lead to a tipping point, accelerating the switch to electric vehicles in many more countries around 2023-24,"" Per Magnus Nysveen, senior partner at Rystad Energy, a consultancy in Oslo, told Reuters.

""We will start to see that this starts to dig into global oil demand in a very significant way,"" he said.

According to a Reuters analysis of 27 automakers compiled in partnership with Constellation Research & Technology, most companies apart from Elon Musk's Tesla Inc and China's BYD Co Ltd are still in the early stages of transitioning to EVs, which make up a fraction of global sales.

(For an interactive graphic on business model transformation and decarbonization within the auto manufacturing sector, see: https://graphics.reuters.com/DATA-ESG/AUTOS/ygdpzylllvw/index.html)

With mid-sized to large petroleum-fuelled SUVs and trucks driving much of the recent growth in the auto sector, many companies are banking on these high-emitting gas-guzzlers to drive their near-term performance.

Nevertheless, with China's BAIC Motor Corp and German rivals Volkswagen (DE: ) Group and Daimler AG (DE: ) pursuing some of the industry's most ambitious decarbonisation targets, investors are increasingly using a company's EV prospects as a proxy for future success.

""All the growth in transportation is being eaten by electricity,"" said Harry Benham, chairman of Ember-Climate, a British energy transition think-tank. ""Oil and gas companies have got no ability to defeat electricity as a transport fuel.""

PEAK OIL DEMAND?

With fuel for road transport accounting for about half of all oil demand, the possibility of a faster-than-expected switch to EVs in the wake of the pandemic is one of the main reasons some forecasts for a peak have been brought forward.

Global oil demand hit a record of just over 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019. Rystad now sees demand topping out at 106.5 million-107 million bpd in 2027-2028. The consultancy had previously forecast a marginally higher peak in 2030.

Although the oil industry has defied numerous attempts to call ""peak oil"" in the past, the fact that the International Energy Agency projects that demand will plunge by a record 8.6 million bpd this year has reignited the debate.

Though as yet a minority view, some believe the pandemic is reshaping patterns of work, aviation and commuting so profoundly that oil demand might never return to 2019 levels - a potential boost to hopes of avoiding the worst impacts of climate change.

""It's inconceivable that all that demand for oil comes back in one go, so the real question is how much of that is lost permanently,"" said Mark Lewis, head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas (PA: ) Asset Management.

Underscoring the changing economics of transport, Reuters revealed last week that Tesla plans to introduce a new low-cost, long-life battery in its Model 3 sedan in China that it expects to bring the cost of EVs in line with gasoline models.

Despite such potential breakthroughs, the Constellation data shows that automakers still have a long way to go to align themselves with climate goals enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement, with Ford Motor (NYSE: ) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles among the biggest laggards.

Volkswagen has announced some of the most aggressive long-term plans to decarbonise its fleet, but the company still has to prove it can build EVs at scale, and has led the field in ramping up sales of mid- and large SUVs, the data shows.

Although the public decarbonisation targets of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp are only a little bolder than the industry average, the company's proven capacity to build hybrids may bode well for its EV ambitions, the data suggests.

Japan's Subaru Corp, which produces only a small number of hybrid vehicles, might have to rely on its partnership with Toyota if it wants to prosper as demand for EVs picks up, Constellation analysts said.

'CRISIS OF UNCERTAINTY'

Although the oil industry hopes to offset demand lost to EVs with a growing appetite for crude to make petrochemicals and plastics, companies facing growing pressure from investors over climate change are increasingly open about the risks.

In April, Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), said the company did not expect oil demand to recover in the medium term, saying the industry was living in a ""crisis of uncertainty"".

Bernard Looney, chief executive of BP (LON: ), was later quoted in the Financial Times as saying he would not ""write off"" the possibility the world had reached peak oil.

Much will depend on whether economies stage a V-shaped recovery, as some forecasters predict, and how far governments adopt new EV targets as part of ""green stimulus"" packages to spur a faster shift to a low-carbon future.

With many European politicians calling for green recoveries, the French government signalled on Monday that the country wants to boost sales of low-emission cars. China has extended backing for EVs as part of its recovery package, and U.S. Democrats are exploring ways to boost demand for clean vehicles.

With various European countries planning to ultimately ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars, some see increasingly ambitious EV commitments by automakers as another sign of the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era.

""One of the primary factors holding back the transition has been resistance by the fossil fuel incumbents,"" said Kingsmill Bond, senior strategist at financial think-tank Carbon Tracker. ""Now those incumbents are significantly weakened.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/past-its-peak-battered-oil-demand-faces-threat-from-electric-vehicles-2122417,0.081,0.837,0.082,0.398

Although the oil industry hopes to offset demand lost to EVs with a growing appetite for crude to make petrochemicals and plastics, companies facing growing pressure from investors over climate change are increasingly open about the risks.

In April, Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), said the company did not expect oil demand to recover in the medium term, saying the industry was living in a ""crisis of uncertainty"".

Bernard Looney, chief executive of BP (LON: ), was later quoted in the Financial Times as saying he would not ""write off"" the possibility the world had reached peak oil.

Much will depend on whether economies stage a V-shaped recovery, as some forecasters predict, and how far governments adopt new EV targets as part of ""green stimulus"" packages to spur a faster shift to a low-carbon future.

With many European politicians calling for green recoveries, the French government signalled on Monday that the country wants to boost sales of low-emission cars. China has extended backing for EVs as part of its recovery package, and U.S. Democrats are exploring ways to boost demand for clean vehicles.

With various European countries planning to ultimately ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars, some see increasingly ambitious EV commitments by automakers as another sign of the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era.

""One of the primary factors holding back the transition has been resistance by the fossil fuel incumbents,"" said Kingsmill Bond, senior strategist at financial think-tank Carbon Tracker. ""Now those incumbents are significantly weakened.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/past-its-peak-battered-oil-demand-faces-threat-from-electric-vehicles-2122417#comments,0.081,0.837,0.082,0.398

Investing.com - European stock markets posted strong gains Monday, as the region’s economies reopen amid positive corporate news.

At 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the in Germany traded 2.7% higher, 40 rose 2.4%, while the U.K.'s index was up 2.3%.

Shops, restaurants and hair salons have started trading again in Italy on Monday, while other centers of the outbreak, such as Spain and France, have gradually lifted restrictions that have plunged the region’s economy in a severe downturn.

""The economies of Europe and the U.S. likely bottomed out in April and are slowly starting to come back to life,"" said Barclays (LON: )' economist Christian Keller, in a research note to clients.

""However, incoming data from most economies highlight the depth of the contraction, raising risks of longer-term scarring that might undermine the recovery.""

Regulators across the Continent also signaled a return to normality by saying they will end the bans on short-selling that they imposed in March as panic struck.

Earlier Monday, data in Japan confirmed the world's third largest economy slipped into recession in the first quarter, putting it on course for its worst postwar slump as the coronavirus takes a heavy toll.

In corporate news, Total (PA: ) stock climbed 6.2% after the oil producer called off plans to acquire Occidental Petroleum's (NYSE: ) assets in Ghana, citing “the extraordinary market environment and the lack of visibility that the group faces.” Instead, the group is to buy gas and power assets in Spain from EDP Energias de Portugal (OTC: ), in a deal valued at 515 million euros.

Fellow oil giants BP (NYSE: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) also posted strong gains, 5.9% and 3.9%, respectively, as the price of crude continued to push higher.

At 4:15 AM ET, June futures traded 5% higher at $30.98 a barrel. The international benchmark contract rose 4% to $33.80.

Accor (PA: ) stock rose 3.4% after securing a new banking credit facility, as well as seeing some ""initial signs of business improvement.” The French hotel company, like so many in the tourism sector, has been hit hard by the impact of the coronavirus.

Ryanair (LON: ) climbed over 8% after reporting on Monday reported a profit after tax of 1 billion euros ($1.08 billion) for the year to March 31. It added that it was unable to provide a forecast for the current year due to Covid-19 and cut its annual passenger traffic target by a further 20%.

German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE: ) jumped 5% after a source told Reuters it was in talks with international peers about a possible merger for its loss-making steel business.

596,596,SHEL,2020-05-18,These are the 4 highest-paying FTSE 100 dividend shares. Here’s what I’d buy By The Motley Fool,"Published May 18, 2020 15:49 Updated May 18, 2020 16:10

These are the 4 highest-paying FTSE 100 dividend shares. Here’s what I’d buy

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BATS -2.54% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio IMB +1.29% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio WPP -0.41% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SSE -1.17% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Investors seeking long-term quality dividend shares have been hit by crushing body blows in the last two months. Blue-chip FTSE 100 favourites have slashed or halted dividend payments in 2020. These include Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), BT, and WPP (LON: ). But there is still hope for income-seekers.

I’m looking ahead to 2021 and 2022. I’ve planned many, many holidays. And I’m stacking up the investment cases for the highest dividend-paying FTSE 100 shares.

Top FTSE 100 dividend payers The top four highest-yield FTSE 100 dividend shares that still plan to pay out in full in 2020 are these. First, Imperial Brands (LON: ), with a 12.6% yield. Then BP (LSE:LON: ), with a 10.8% yield. Third is SSE (LSE:LON: ), which offers 7.8%, and fourth is British American Tobacco (LON: ) (6.9% yield).

I’ve considered Imperial Brands a few times over the years. But I don’t like seeing a share price in a long-term downtrend. It has lost 60% of its value since 2016. It is also selling off assets — hitting future profitability — to pay what I believe is an unsustainably high dividend. I’d avoid.

I’m a bigger fan of its nearest rival, British American Tobacco, which has a market-leading grip on e-cigarettes and is innovating more quickly as well. At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 9, I think there’s plenty of long-term value to be had here.

Energetic future BP is an interesting one. Unlike supermajor rival Shell it is — so far — honoring its full 2020 dividend payment. At under 300p it boasts a yield of 10.8%, and a reasonable P/E of 18.

I think BP may still have to cut its dividend despite issuing billions in debt and slashing spending. But I’d still buy it at this level, as I’m certain dividends will return and the price will recover strongly in three to five years. Also, it has a better shot than Shell at thriving in the fast-approaching carbon-neutral economy.

Covid-19 has likely ended rampant business air travel but the future looks bright even if we have passed peak oil demand.

BP already owns the fastest UK electric vehicle charging network. And it has exciting prospects in China, considering the much larger market there. In 2019 it entered a joint venture with Chinese rideshare giant Didi Chuxing to snap up the same EV infrastructure. I’d wager this will be a very large and consistent source of revenue in the coming years.

Come see SSE I’ve made no secret in the past of my support for SSE as the best FTSE 100 renewables play. A P/E of 18 isn’t particularly cheap. But it is perhaps testament to how the market feels about its future-facing revenue growth. And that tasty dividend looks secure because of its major infrastructure projects in the pipeline.

The UK government has committed to cutting carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. It will need SSE’s help to get there. Last week SSE announced it had chosen to host the operations base for the 3.6GW, £9bn Dogger Bank – the world’s largest offshore wind project – in the Port of Tyne close to Newcastle.

That means hundreds of new jobs in Tyneside, for one. And UK renewable energy is, as Business Secretary Alok Sharma noted: “One of the UK’s great success stories.” I’d buy SSE over and over again.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shareholder activists prodding Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ) on climate-change proposals are backing calls for an independent board chairman as the oil major steps up efforts to keep climate proposals off its ballot.

New York state's pension fund, Church Commissioners for England, and Legal & General Investment Management, which all battled Exxon over global warming and lobbying disclosures have this year taken up a call to split the chief executive officer and chairman roles, expecting a better reception from an outsider.

""The company has been a laggard on financial performance, climate risk management and lobbying disclosure for quite some time now,"" said Thomas DiNapoli, New York state comptroller and head of the state's biggest pension fund. ""Its peers in Europe, many of whom have independent board chairs, are outperforming Exxon on all these,"" he said.

California Public Employees Retirement System, which holds 9.6 million Exxon shares, just behind New York's 10.2 million shares, last week came out in favor of splitting the two roles. Proxy adviser Glass, Lewis & Co separately called for splitting the two roles.

On Tuesday, Institutional Shareholder Services urged holders to vote ""against"" creating an independent chairman, reversing its stance from a year ago. Exxon's naming of a lead director able to meet with shareholders changed its view, ISS wrote.

Still, Exxon management is under scrutiny after reporting the first loss in three decades. Under Chairman and CEO Darren Woods, Exxon spent heavily in the last three years for new oil and supplies, a move that has so far backfired as prices collapsed.

Exxon's broad rejection of climate proposals, challenging sponsors and rebuffing proposals as micromanaging or unneeded, has accelerated under Woods. This year, Exxon challenged and blocked six climate resolution from appearing at its May 27 shareholder meeting.

Rivals Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ), Repsol SA (MC: ) and BP Plc (L: ) meantime adopted proposals to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

Climate measures elsewhere are gaining. Three climate proposals this year have won majority votes, including at oil firms' Phillips 66 (N: ) and Ovintiv Inc (N: ). While not all results from the 15 are in yet, last year none received a majority, according to data compiled by the Sustainable Investments Institute.

Activists are smarting from a 2017 vote. That year, 62% of shareholders approved a measure led by New York state and calling for Exxon to disclose business impacts from complying with climate policies. After agreeing not to pursue the topic the following year, New York officials were disappointed by the resulting report.

An Exxon spokesman declined to comment, pointing to rebuttals that note it has increased the lead director's power. Combining the chairman and CEO roles ""ensures items of greatest importance for the business"" are quickly brought to the board, Exxon told shareholders in urging a vote against the measure. It also pointed to $10 billion in lower-emissions investments it has made over a decade.

The proposal for an independent board chairman would not take effect under Woods, but would be phased in for future CEOs.

As at other big companies, shareholder support for an independent chairman has never gotten far at Exxon. Last year, 40.7% of Exxon shareholders supported the measure, up from 38.7% in 2018. A measure calling for the company to report on its lobbying activities also failed.

But both were ""within striking distance of getting a majority,"" said Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at the Church Commissioners for England. Exxon's rejection of climate proposals ""is in stark contrast to all of its supermajor peers,"" he said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/climate-activists-up-stakes-at-exxon-backing-calls-for-independent-board-chairman-2118415,0.042,0.902,0.056,0.7184

OSLO (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), holds a 0.3% stake in oil and gas firm Equinor (OL: ), the Norwegian firm's public records showed ahead of Thursday's annual general meeting of shareholders.

The stake, worth 1.5 billion Norwegian crowns (120.00 million pounds), makes PIF the 19th biggest owner. The Norwegian government owns 67% of Equinor.

The Saudi fund, which manages over $300 billion in assets, earlier this year bought stakes in Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), Total (PA: ), Eni (MI: ) and Equinor, a source familiar with the transactions told Reuters on April 9.

PIF's purchases, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, came as demand for oil slumped due to the COVID-19 outbreak, pushing oil shares down.

Equinor's shares dropped to 95.20 crowns on March 16, the lowest level since 2008, but have since recovered to trade at 135.50 crowns on Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top oil and gas companies have diverted a larger share of their cash to green energy projects since the coronavirus outbreak in a bet the global health crisis will leave a long-term dent in fossil fuel demand, according to a Reuters review of company statements and interviews with executives.

The plans of companies like BP (L: ), Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Total (PA: ) are in step with the European Union's efforts to transition to a lower-carbon economy and away from a century-old reliance on oil, and reflect the region's widening rift with the United States where both the government and the top drillers are largely staying committed to oil and gas.

""We are all living differently and there is a real possibility that some of this will stick,"" BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney told Reuters in a recent interview, citing big declines in air and road travel, and a boost in telecommuting.

Global oil majors have all cut capital spending sharply as worldwide stay-at-home orders triggered by the coronavirus outbreak slammed fuel demand and sent oil prices to record lows.

But Europe's top five producers - BP, Shell, Total, Eni (MI: ), and Equinor (OL: ) - are all focusing their investment cuts mainly on oil and gas activities, and giving their renewables and low carbon businesses a relative boost, according to Reuters calculations.

(Graphic: European oil majors' 2020 spending tilts green - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/yzdvxowmqpx/eikon.png)

Company executives and investors say they expect fossil fuel demand to peak earlier than previously thought. At the same time, the EU is expected to focus economic stimulus on green energy infrastructure in the wake of the crisis to further align it with the ambitions of the Paris agreement to fight climate change, making investments in the sector more attractive.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently pledged to make climate policies the bloc's ""motor for the recovery.”

BP aims to keep its previously planned $500 million in spending on low-carbon initiatives this year intact, despite a company-wide spending cut of 20% in the wake of the coronavirus, its incoming Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss said in an analyst call on April 28.

Shell CEO Ben van Beurden, meanwhile, told reporters in an April 30 conference call he also wants to ""spare"" the company's New Energy division, which is focused on renewables and low-carbon technologies, from the worst of its budget cuts.

""We still believe there is an energy transition under way that may pick up speed in the recovery stage and we want to be well-positioned,"" van Beurden said.

Total still plans to spend its previously planned $1.5-$2 billion on its low-carbon business, despite cutting its overall 2020 spending by $3 billion to $15 billion, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in an interview with French paper Le Figaro on May 6.

(Graphic: European oil majors' power ambitions - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gjnvweonwvw/Oil%20Majors%20power%20ambitions.png)

Equinor and Eni also both expressed a continued commitment to their plans to transition to clean energy. An Equinor spokesman confirmed the company is not changing its planned $1 billion of investment in renewables and low carbon energy in 2020 and 2021, despite cuts elsewhere.

Equinor, Shell and Total also announced on May 15 they are investing in a project in Norway to capture and store carbon.

Even after the rejigged spending, investments in renewables and low-carbon technologies for the top five European oil companies represents no more than 15% of total investments, and climate advocates are pressuring the companies to do more.

The group had already outlined plans to sharply reduce carbon emissions by 2050 prior to the coronavirus outbreak.

Some investor said, however, that these plans fall short of the Paris climate goals.

London-based investor Sarasin & Partners said that neither Shell or Total ""has set out how they will shift capital away from expanding fossil fuel production to the extent required by their ambitions.""

TRANS-ATLANTIC RIFT

The biggest U.S. oil and gas companies are taking a different path, encouraged by a government that is a vocal supporter of expanding fossil fuel production: investment in business ventures outside petroleum hardly register, and that is not going to change without a shift in government policy.

Chevron (N: ) CEO Mike Wirth told investors in a conference call on May 1 he expects demand for oil and gas to rebound after the coronavirus pandemic lifts.

""The world is not ready to transition to another source of energy in large part anytime soon,"" he said.

Exxon Mobil (N: ) CEO Darren Woods echoed the view in a call with analysts on the same day.

""I know that there are a lot of different views on what the future holds, but I want to be clear on how we see it: The long-term fundamentals that drive our business have not changed.""

Exxon shareholder activists unhappy with the company's broad rejection of climate proposals in recent years have been pushing recently to strip Woods of his dual chairman role.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents all the largest U.S. oil and gas drillers as well as Shell, BP and Total, said it also views the coronavirus outbreak’s impact on fossil fuel demand as a blip.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has long cast doubt on the science of climate change and has decided to pull out of the Paris climate agreement citing the economic cost. The administration is also contemplating ways to pump billions into its oil and gas sector through tax breaks to preserve an industry that rapidly grew over the past decade.

The yawning transatlantic divide offers investors a troubling choice, according to analysts.

On the one hand, aligning with international commitments to the Paris deal seems like a ""safe choice"", according to Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship Hermes Equity Ownership Services.

On the other hand, the deeply depressed prices for fossil fuels since the onset of the coronavirus could make it the easy choice for consumers as economies recover.

""At the moment it is not clear who is right,"" said Tal Lomnitzer, senior investment manager at Janus Henderson. ""It is possible that Exxon and Chevron will emerge from the other side of the crisis looking like heroes. Or possibly irresponsible.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/coronavirus/coronavirus-widens-climate-rift-between-european-and-us-oil-majors-2121170,0.067,0.839,0.094,0.9803

The last few months has been a challenging period for many investors. Since the middle of February, the has fallen around 20%. Many popular Footsie stocks, such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and BT Group (LON: ), have performed far worse.

There are some investors that have come through the last few months relatively unscathed however. One such investor is Terry Smith – the man they often call ‘Britain’s Warren Buffett’. Over the last three months, his equity fund, Fundsmith, has only fallen around 3%. That’s a significantly better return than the FTSE 100 has generated. So, what’s Smith doing differently that has enabled him to outperform?

Global opportunities The first thing to understand about Smith’s investment strategy is he invests with a global focus. This means that, relative to those who only invest in the UK, he has access to a wider range of opportunities.

This ability has certainly helped Smith outperform this year. For example, his top holding, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), which is listed in the US, is up over 10% this year. Meanwhile, his second top holding, PayPal, which is also listed in the US, is up around 30% year-to-date.

Growth stocks Smith also has a strong focus on companies with attractive growth prospects. PayPal is a good example. It’s benefiting as the world makes more electronic payments and uses cash less. Over the last three years, revenue at PayPal has grown over 60%. There aren’t many companies in the FTSE 100 that have generated that level of top-line growth.

Sector bias It’s also worth pointing out that Fundsmith has a strong focus on three main sectors. These are technology, healthcare, and consumer staples. This has also contributed to the fund’s strong performance. It’s not hard to see why. The technology sector is benefitting as we all work and shop from home, while healthcare and consumer staples are defensive sectors that offer high levels of resilience during periods of economic uncertainty. Just look at FTSE 100 consumer staples stock Reckitt Benckiser, which Fundsmith holds. It’s up over 10% this year.

High-quality businesses Finally, Smith invests in high-quality businesses that are resilient to change and can sustain a high return on capital employed. FTSE 100 champion Unilever (LON: ) is a good example of a high-quality stock he owns.

Generally speaking, these kinds of stocks tend to outperform when the market crashes. Looking at Unilever, it’s only down about 5% this year.

It’s not hard to invest like Smith Can your average UK investor invest in the same way that Smith does? Absolutely.

For a start, it’s very easy to add internationally-listed stocks to your portfolio. Through platforms such as Hargreaves Lansdown (LON: ), you can invest in world-class companies listed overseas within minutes.

Secondly, there are plenty of high-quality, resilient businesses listed on the London Stock Exchange UK investors can invest in. Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser, Diageo (LON: ), and Sage are some good examples. These kinds of companies can provide portfolio stability.

Finally, there are plenty of UK stocks that have attractive long-term growth prospects. You just need to know where to look. Often, they’re outside the FTSE 100.

With banks having cut their dividends along with many other industries, such as housebuilders, some of the traditional sources of dividends for income investors have dried up. According to AJ Bell, the total amount that’s been lost is £24bn.

Industries for income investors But some industries are holding up better than others. The fast moving consumer goods (FCMG) sector is a good place to look for steady dividend growth and quality companies. Investments trusts are another source of dividends with their ability to retain earnings from previous years. For high dividend yields and share with defensive qualities, the utilities sector is also fertile ground for income investors.

The Association of Investment Companies (AIC) has a list of ‘dividend heroes’ – those that have increased their dividends continuously for 20 years or more.

Leading FMCG companies I’ll turn my attention now to what I think are some of the leading companies in these industries for investors looking for income.

Within FMCG, Unilever (LSE: LON: ) and Reckitt Benckiser (LSE: RB) are among the biggest UK players. Both typically have higher than average P/E ratios, a sign of their quality and investors being prepared to pay a premium to buy the shares. The P/E ratios now are 19 and 20 respectively.

The companies are investor stalwarts in times like these when demand for their products holds up well. Customers still need to eat and keep their homes clean. Illustrating this point, sales at Reckitt Benckiser rose 12.3% in the first three months of 2020. Reckitt said growth was led by strong demand for many of its hygiene and health products, in particular Dettol, Lysol, Mucinex and Nurofen.

Investment trusts for income investors When it comes to investment trusts with dividend yields above the average of companies in the , there’s a myriad of options.

If we turn back to the AIC’s list of dividend heroes, we find top of the pile is the City of London Investment Trust (LSE: CTY). It has 50 consecutive years of dividend growth. It still manages to yield 5.5%, which is ideal for income investors. Top holdings in the trust include any of the UK’s most well-known corporations from Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) to HSBC and British American Tobacco (LON: ). Also in the top 10 companies are Unilever, GlaxoSmithKline and National Grid (LON: ).

Other options for income investors wanting to invest in trusts are Murray Income, Temple Bar and Invesco Income Growth. All three of these also happen to trade at a discount to their net asset value.

The last word is on utilities. In the sector, there are a number of higher-yielding companies with slow and steady earnings growth. These aren’t exciting companies, but in a volatile market they tend to hold their value better and keep providing dividends. That’s one of the upsides from having regulated earnings. From the , investors have several companies to choose from. My preference is for National Grid which has a significant presence in the US as well as the UK.

Forget the death of dividends! I’d buy this FTSE 100 cash machine today

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio VOD -0.85% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio FTLC -0.29% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

This year, UK investors were eagerly looking forward to pocketing almost £100 billion in cash dividends from and other UK-listed companies. Then along came the coronavirus pandemic, plus an oil crisis, causing a steep stock market crash.

FTSE 100 dividends are dying Alas, according to the Financial Times, FTSE 100 members alone have slashed shareholder payouts by £23.8 billion since this crisis erupted. Shockingly, some of the UK’s most reliable dividend dynamos cancelled their cash payouts, including oil behemoth Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and telecoms stalwart BT.

Among the wider , more than one in three firms have suspended or cancelled dividends in the past 10 weeks, with only 23 declaring a dividend since this crisis unfolded.

When companies face existential crises like Covid-19, it makes sense to conserve cash at hand, because today’s dividend payouts might just threaten firms’ tomorrows. Also, cancelling dividends now might easily lead to lower future payouts, which is why Mr Market likes to severely mark down share prices of dividend-cutters.

Go big for bumper dividends Of course, when Shell – the largest UK’s dividend-payer by far – cancels its payout for the first time in 75 years, I fear for dividends right across the market spectrum. Then again, some FTSE 100 payouts were not fully covered by earnings and cash flow, so a few suspensions or resets are hardly surprising and even expected.

Given that Footsie dividends are highly concentrated among mega-caps (the very biggest businesses), it’s here that I’d recommend income investors focus their search for yield.

Good old Vodafone (LON: ) fits my bill My pick of the FTSE 100 crop for income-seeking investors is a long-time favourite among high-yield fans: Vodafone (LSE: VOD). Here are six reasons why:

First of all, Vodafone has an easily understood business model, providing telecoms services to 444 million customers in 26 countries.

Second, Vodafone already cut its dividend, taking an axe to the payout by almost halving it in 2019. This ‘accidental foresight’ has left the firm with far greater liquidity going into this historic downturn.

Third, the FTSE 100 company confirmed in its full-year results earlier this week that it would hold its dividend – great news for desperate pension funds and pensioners alike.

Fourth, even after ‘the halvening’, Vodafone’s current yield is a whopping 6.6%, based on a yearly dividend of 7.9p and a share price currently hovering around 119p.

Fifth, this financial year’s cash payout should be fully covered by Vodafone’s free cash flow (estimated at £4.4 billion).

Sixth, after roughly halving over the past five years, Vodafone’s shares are not obviously overpriced in historical terms, given that the company has recently resumed revenue growth.

In summary, there you have it: a FTSE 100 firm offering one of the market’s highest dividend yields, in an industry that has largely dodged the worst of the coronavirus crisis. What’s not to like?

Have £1000 to invest? I’d buy these 2 FTSE 100 dividend stocks today

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BATS -2.54% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio AAL -2.13% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BT -0.71% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio Copper -0.26% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

The stock market crash has prompted a number of companies issuing full or partial dividend cuts. Most recently, these dividend cuts have been extended to both BT Group (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ). This has deprived income investors of two dividend stocks with extremely high yields. As such, it is certainly worth exploring other shares that may be able to fill this gap.

A global leader amongst dividend stocks The first high-yield income stock is the international tobacco and FTSE 100 company British American Tobacco (LSE: LON: ). Founded in 1902, British American Tobacco now has operations in around 180 different countries. Its cigarettes are also chosen by around one in eight of the 1.1 billion smokers in the world.

Nevertheless, it is British American Tobacco’s reputation as a dividend stock that piques my interest. With a yield of around 7%, the firm is in the largest 25% of dividend payers in the UK. Whilst this is a very attractive yield, it is also important to analyse whether British American Tobacco has the necessary funds to cover it. In this respect, with a dividend cover of 1.55, I rate this FTSE 100 tobacco company as a very reliable dividend stock.

On the other hand, this dividend stock does not come without risk. Firstly, the cigarette industry is declining. Although British American Tobacco has attempted to introduce a number of safer products, the declining number of smokers may still hinder growth in the company. This is especially relevant because smokers are reported to be at further risk to coronavirus. In addition, BATS has a significant amount of debt on the balance sheet and this may become unsustainable in the event of any future downturn.

A top FTSE 100 mining company The second high-yield dividend stock is Anglo American (LSE: LON: ). Anglo American is a global mining company, as well as being the world’s largest producer of platinum. It is also a major producer of diamonds, , nickel and iron ore. Whilst I cannot see significant demand for products like diamonds in the near future, the metals mined are still essential in products like smartphones, electric cars and wind turbines. This will help this dividend stock cope throughout the pandemic.

As with British American Tobacco, Anglo American has a very impressive yield of 5.5%. A dividend cover of 2.49 also cements this as fairly reliable. Furthermore, this dividend stock has a stronger balance sheet than that of BATS. This includes slightly more cash and far less debt than the tobacco company. For this reason, I believe that this FTSE 100 company is a good stock for any income investor.

In conclusion, I believe that both these dividend stocks offer reliable yields that help counteract the effects of the dividend cuts from other FTSE 100 companies. With a stronger balance sheet and larger dividend cover, I would rate Anglo American as the safer option — yet I can certainly see strong recoveries for both the two companies.

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio FRES -3.35% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Investing £2k, or any other amount, in FTSE 100 shares today may not deliver strong returns over the coming months. In fact, an uncertain outlook for the world economy may cause challenging trading conditions for many of the index’s members.

However, over the long run the index is likely to recover from its recent crash to post new record highs. It has achieved this goal following each of its previous downturns.

With that in mind, here are two FTSE 100 shares that appear to offer good value for money at the present time. They could be worth buying as part of a diverse portfolio of equities.

FTSE 100 miner Fresnillo (LON: ) Precious metals miner Fresnillo’s (LSE: FRES) share price has bucked the wider FTSE 100 trend to post a 5% rise since the start of the year. This could be due to improving investor sentiment towards gold miners as the commodity has often been viewed as a store of wealth during uncertain economic periods.

Furthermore, Fresnillo recently released a relatively positive update for the first quarter of the year. Its gold and silver production was in line with expectations, while it is making encouraging progress on its development pipeline. This may help the FTSE 100 business to deliver rising production in the coming years after some disappointing performances over recent years.

Despite its share price rise, Fresnillo seems to offer good value for money at the present time. It trades on a price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of around 0.4. This suggests that investors have not yet priced-in its growth potential, which could lead to a rising share price over the medium term.

Fresnillo may also benefit from a continued uncertain economic outlook. As such, it could deliver stronger share price performance than many of its peers.

Shell (LON: ) The oil price may have rebounded over recent weeks, but it continues to trade at exceptionally low levels. This is likely to negatively impact on the performances of a wide range of oil and gas companies, including FTSE 100 stock Shell (LSE: RDSB).

In response, the business has taken actions such as reducing its dividend, cutting capital expenditure plans and aiming to slash its operating expenses. These changes could help to strengthen its financial position ahead of what is set to be a challenging period for the wider industry.

Shell’s share price has declined by 47% since the start of the year. This suggests that investors have started to factor-in the problems it could face should commodity prices remain at low levels.

Since the FTSE 100 company has greater size and scale than many of its sector peers, it may be in a stronger position to survive difficult operating conditions over the short term. Therefore, on a long-term outlook, it could offer recovery potential from its current stock price level.

DUBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund has bought minority stakes in major American companies including Boeing (N: ), Facebook (O: ) and Citigroup (N: ), a regulatory filing showed, giving it a portfolio of nearly $10 billion (8.26 billion pounds) in U.S.-listed stocks.

The $300 billion Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been buying minority stakes in companies across the world, taking advantage of market weakness in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

The PIF disclosed stakes worth $713.7 million in Boeing, ABOUT $522 million in Citigroup, $522 million in Facebook, $495.8 million in Disney (N: ) and $487.6 million in Bank of America (N: ), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing https:// on Friday showed.

The PIF has a nearly $514 million stake in Marriott (O: ) and a small holding in Berkshire Hathaway (N: ), according to the filing. The PIF also disclosed an $827.7 million stake in oil company BP (L: ), which has American Depository Receipts (ADRs) listed in the United States.

""The Saudi sovereign fund went shopping in Q1,"" tweeted Ali Al-Salim, co-founder of Dubai-based consulting firm Arkan Partners, adding that it now held about $10 billion in U.S.-listed equities, up from $2 billion at the start of the year.

PIF's strategy is two-pronged; building an international portfolio of investments and investing locally in projects that will help reduce Saudi Arabia's reliance on oil.

""PIF is a patient investor with a long-term horizon. As such, we actively seek strategic opportunities both in Saudi Arabia and globally that have strong potential to generate significant long-term returns while further benefiting the people of Saudi Arabia and driving the country's economic growth,"" the sovereign wealth fund said in a statement.

""These opportunities include sectors and companies that are well positioned to drive economies and lead sectors moving forward.""

The PIF has separately funded almost half of Japanese investor SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund, which has been hit by losses on technology bets.

Last month the PFI's head, Yasir al-Rumayyan, said it was looking into investment opportunities in areas such as aviation, oil and gas, and entertainment, adding that there would be a lot of potential for investment opportunities once the coronavirus crisis passes.

The PIF disclosed an 8.2% stake in coronavirus-hit Carnival Corp (N: ) in April, sending the cruise operator's shares nearly 30% higher.

The Saudi fund bought stakes in Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), Total (PA: ), Eni (MI: ) and Equinor (OL: ) earlier this year , a source familiar with the transactions told Reuters on April 9.

The SEC filing on Friday showed it had a $483.6 million stake in Shell, a $222.3 million holding in Total and a $481 million stake in Suncor Energy (TO: ).

An earlier filing in Norway had shown the PIF had a 0.3% stake in oil and gas firm Equinor.

LONDON (Reuters) - None of the big oil companies currently meet U.N. targets to limit global warming despite the most ambitious targets set by Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Eni (MI: ), investors managing $19 trillion said on Tuesday.

The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI), which represents the investors and is co-chaired by the Church of England Pensions Board, called on all oil and gas producers to set both intensity-based and absolute emissions reductions targets so that the industry adheres to a common standard on 'net zero' emissions.

Burning of oil and gas accounts for the vast majority of the world’s carbon emissions. TPI, in a study of Europe's biggest oil producers, singled out Shell and Italy's Eni for making the broadest commitments to reduce greenhouse gases from all fuel products they sell, also known as Scope 3 emissions.

All European majors have committed to varying degrees of carbon reductions by 2050 to make their companies fit for a transition to a lower carbon economy. In marked contrast, U.S. oil giants (N: ) (N: ) (N: ) lag far behind in terms of climate aims.

Shell has pledged to bring down its overall carbon intensity by 65%, Eni by 55% and BP by 50% by 2050. Intensity targets mean that absolute emissions can rise with increasing production.

Eni has also set itself a target to bring down its absolute emissions by 2050 by 80%.

Scope 3 emissions dwarf, typically by a factor of about six, direct emissions from operations and from the electricity a company uses, known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

BP (L: ) and Spain's Repsol (MC: ) have pledged to bring down their overall emissions to net zero by 2050, but this target does not cover fuel initially acquired from other producers and sold through their marketing businesses.

Most companies use the phrase 'net zero' carbon in some way to describe their ambitions, despite the varying pathways.

""We now need a net zero standard for the oil and gas sector,"" said Adam Matthews of the Church of England Pensions Board.

None of the companies had done enough to align with plans to keep global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, TPI said.

""Claims of 'net zero' or 1.5 C alignment are not substantiated by TPI's analysis. Even the most ambitious new goals (Shell and Eni) are not aligned with a 2 C scenario using TPI’s intensity metric,"" TPI said in a report.

""Alignment with a Below 2 C scenario requires a 90% cut in emissions intensity (by 2050) while alignment with 1.5 C scenario requires a 100% reduction in net emissions (a genuine 'net zero' strategy).""

It added that only Eni had provided substantial detail on its use of nature-based offsets - an integral part of every group's climate targets - to balance out emissions it cannot eliminate.

Austria's OMV (VI: ) is the laggard with the least ambitious climate targets among big integrated European oil companies, TPI said, adding it expected OMV to issue an update on its transition plans this year.

TPI also urged all groups to provide more detail on their carbon capture and storage renewables investment plans.

A spokesman for BP said it believed its overall transition plan was consistent with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate deal to curb global warming.

""What the world needs to meet the Paris goals are absolute reductions in emissions to net zero ... We do not believe that carbon intensity alone is a reliable single measure of progress towards the Paris goals,"" he said.

A Shell spokeswoman said ""we need to look at the detail of this report, but we are pleased our ambition is recognised and we are confident our approach is aligned with the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal of the Paris Agreement.""

An OMV spokesman said OMV had already achieved its 2025 targets and that it would set itself more ambitious climate protection goals.

Eni said in an emailed statement that ""the best way to cope with the Paris Agreement ambitions is to act on net absolute emissions,"" adding its board would submit a new incentive plan at its shareholder meeting on Wednesday linked to performance on the reduction of emissions.

A spokesman for Repsol said its target to reduce emissions from its own barrels by 40% had a 2040 deadline.

2 income stocks I’d buy following FTSE 100 dividend cuts

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio FTMC -0.21% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Dividends continue to fall like dominoes across the . BT is the latest hallowed income hero to have taken the axe to shareholder payouts. This is the first time it’s cut dividends since the banking crisis a decade ago.

Make no mistake. The global economy faces the sort of meltdown we haven’t seen in modern times. When Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) also chooses to reduce dividends — the first time it’s done so since 1946 — you know a truckload of pain is coming down the tracks.

A FTSE 100 star So what are income hunters to do in these troubled times? Of course, investors need to pore over a company’s profits outlook and balance sheet a bit more carefully than usual. However, it doesn’t mean they need to be wringing their hands in fear. There are still great dividend stocks to be found today. You simply need to know where to look.

Buying utilities stocks is always a good idea in turbulent economic times. These are not completely immune to a broader slowdown, of course. They face the same obstacle as some of their customers struggling to pay the bills as household budgets come under pressure. On the whole though, their earnings visibility remains supreme. It’s why United Utilities Group is expected to keep lifting dividends in the short-to-medium term by City brokers.

As a consequence, the Footsie company carries a chunky 4.8% dividend yield. This makes it the best-paying of all of London’s quoted water suppliers. It can be said too, that buying one of these utilities is a better choice than investing in one of the UK’s electricity suppliers. That’s because recent regulatory developments have improved their profits outlook all the way through to 2025.

Another income hero I reckon Begbies Traynor Group (LSE: BEG) is another brilliant share for income seekers. The forward yield sits at a more modest 2.8% for 2020. But I reckon its capacity to keep lifting annual payouts at a fair lick (despite the severe economic impact of Covid-19) makes it worthy of serious attention.

In fact, this stock is set to capitialise on the growing storm facing the British and global economies. Begbies Traynor’s earnings picture seems to improve everytime you open the paper. Latest Bank of England forecasts last week surprised even the most pessimistic of individuals by revealing that the domestic economy will likely suffer its deepest slump since the early 1700s.

Demand for the services of insolvency specialists like this looks set to shoot through the roof in the months (and possibly years) into the future. Latest KPMG data shows that government support packages helped the number of corporate insolvencies fall 33% year-on-year in April. But, as the firm’s head of restructuring Blair Nimmo, comments: “In some cases, the schemes will only help to delay the inevitable.”

So Begbies Traynor looks like one firm that should thrive in these tough conditions.

3 embarrassingly cheap shares that I’d invest in

BARC -0.62% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio NWG -2.23% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio WPP -0.41% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio TMPL -0.22% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Even with the stock market recovering well from its steep March fall, there are opportunities for savvy investors to pick up shares that are still very cheap.

A discount on a range of companies and assets One such share I think is Temple Bar Investment Trust (LSE: LON: ) which has a dividend yield of over 7%. On top of that, the discount to net asset value is around 10%. This is a great combination and makes the shares great value in my opinion.

The trust has a gearing of around 13.3% which is higher than some other similar trusts and this does add some risk, especially when the market falls.

At the end of March, the trust had Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Barclays (LON: ) and RBS (LON: ) as its third, fifth, and sixth biggest holdings respectively. It’ll be interesting to see if that’s changed in light of dividend cuts.

13.3% of the trust is in cash with further hedges provided by 2.9% being in physical silver and gold. The heavy weighting towards big UK companies at a time of dividend cuts is slightly concerning, but for now, I think the big cash position should see it through.

The limping asset manager Jupiter Fund Management (LSE: JUP) combines a yield of 7.5% with a price-to-earnings ratio that is under eight. This indicates to me that the shares are very cheap.

Jupiter is looking to scale up its business by buying growth. In February Jupiter agreed to acquire Merian Global Investors for £370m. It has since stated the deal will go ahead despite the economic uncertainty at the moment.

Both asset managers have been hit by outflows which makes the deal challenging but Merian does have margins of around 50% which is very high, even in this industry. Merian will also boost earnings per share from 2021 as well which is good for management and shareholders.

This isn’t a business that’s firing on all cylinders, but that gives it the potential to recover from a low base. I think the shares look cheap and could be worth a look, especially with a long-term mindset.

Relying on squeezed marketing budgets WPP (LSE: LON: ) is one of those businesses that suffers during a downturn. But assuming any economic downturn isn’t too long-lasting I expect it offers value at the current depressed price. I’m tempted to pick up more of the shares.

That’s because the P/E is now under eight, which puts it on a very similar level to Jupiter. What that shows is many investors are fearful for the future. But if management can keep slimming the business down and further cut debt, while keeping the agencies in the business performing well, then I’m optimistic about WPP’s future.

Conventional wisdom is that companies should reduce marketing spend during a recession. However, there is academic evidence that actually it might be the best time to spend and gain market share, as less well-financed competitors struggle. If enough companies take this view, WPP could do well and for now, the shares are embarrassingly cheap.

(Bloomberg) -- Big Oil emerged from first-quarter earnings battered and bruised, but things are only going to get uglier.

Major oil and gas producers from Norway to the U.S. saw profit plunge in the opening three months of the year. Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). reported its first loss in over 30 years, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc cut its dividend for the first time since the Second World War.

And that was only the result of the initial spread of the coronavirus. Things have got even worse since as a global pandemic caused an unprecedented oil-market slump. There are some signs of recovery on the horizon, but companies were united in their warnings that the current quarter will be tougher than the first.

A few key takeaways show which companies can endure another three months of pain, and those that will struggle:

Dividends in Play

Big Oil’s generous dividends have long been its main attraction to investors. But thanks to Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden they are no longer sacrosanct, after he slashed his company’s payout by two thirds.

“No CEO wants to have on their track record a cut to the dividend,” van Beurden told reporters, after doing just that. Now the taboo is broken, others may follow.

Exxon and Chevron said they remain unwavering in their commitment to the dividend. BP (NYSE: ) Plc CEO Bernard Looney was more equivocal, saying his board would review the payout on a quarterly basis.

Eni SpA boss Claudio Descalzi refused to give guidance on his dividend until July, when the company will be able to evaluate the impact of cost-cutting measures.

Falling Output

Several CEOs said production shut-downs are already happening, whether mandated by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or motivated by low prices. That means most major companies will pump less oil and gas in the second quarter.

Output is already plunging in the U.S., and Exxon Mobil, Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ) plan to cut as much as 660,000 barrels a day by the end of June. Shell and BP are removing rigs from the Permian, with the latter taking $1 billion out of planned spending in its shale business.

BP said it has been contacted by Middle Eastern countries, Russia, Angola and Azerbaijan -- all members of OPEC+ -- to cut crude production. It has been instructed to cut 90,000 barrels a day from its Rumaila field in Iraq.

Kazakhstan will force international oil companies to slow production so the nation can meet its 390,000 barrel-a-day cut, people familiar with the matter said last month. That potentially affects Shell, Eni and Chevron.

It’s not even an OPEC+ member, but Norway’s decision to cut output contributed to Equinor ASA’s decision to scrap a 7% growth target for this year.

Vanishing Cash

For the five largest oil majors combined cash from operations plunged 29% from a year earlier to about $27 billion -- not enough to pay for dividends, interest payments, operating expenses and investments.

That was in a quarter where Dated -- the benchmark against which most of the world’s oil shipments are priced -- averaged about $50 a barrel. Even with the recent recovery in prices, the marker has averaged less than $20 so far in the second quarter, according to BP data.

Companies have resorted to selling bonds and taking out new credit facilities to keep liquidity healthy. For some of them, there are questions about how long they can keep piling on debt.

BP’s gearing -- the ratio of net debt to equity -- shot up 5 percentage points to 36% in the first quarter. While Looney said part of that increase was the result of a temporary working capital build, he refused to give a timeframe for when it would get back to its 20% to 30% comfort range.

For Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber, debt wasn’t an issue. The company has “more than enough” capacity to borrow through a long downturn, and to pay the current dividend for two years at $30 oil, he said.

Buy or Sell?

After digesting first-quarter results, analysts are the most bullish on Total and most bearish on Exxon.

The French company’s finances look strong and its dividend safe, according to research reports. In contrast, the U.S. giant “is walking a tightrope” between shareholder payouts and investing for the long term, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Fernando Valle.

With BP and Eni’s dividends also in a precarious position, according to analysts, the second quarter may prove to be even more dramatic than the first.

Do you believe the stock market is volatile? And does it scare you? If yes, I’d urge you to follow the prices of cryptocurrencies, including . An internet search would bring up stomach-churning price charts that really are scary!

That’s why I think average retail investors who plan long-term for comfortable retirements will be better off investing in stable or companies, rather that buying into Bitcoin for an adrenaline rush.

Where the Bitcoin price is now Every time I look at at a Bitcoin price chart, I immediately notice continuous peaks and troughs as well as choppiness. In other words, soon after it looks like it’s ready to make new highs, the price plummets.

For example, in 2017, the price soared from under $1,000 to nearly $20,000. But it then fell below $7,000. By November 2018, it was below $4,000. Then in June 2019, Bitcoin was over $10,000.

But in early January 2020, Bitcoin was back around $7,000. As broader stock markets began falling in February, Bitcoin hovered around $9,000. By mid-March, it dropped to the $5,000 level.

As global stock indices and individual share prices began recovering from their multi-year lows at the end of March, the Bitcoin price also began an ascent. On 8 May, it was shy of $10,000. But on 13 May, as I write, it is hovering around $8,780.

Amid such wild price swings, the debate over the value and the future of many cryptocurrencies rumbles on. But clearly, investing the hard-earned cash (that you want to grow for retirement years) in Bitcoin is not for everyone.

Blockchain technology is here to stay But there’s a way to have the best of both worlds through buying blockchain-relevant shares. Cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, which can be described as a digital ledger, acting like a spreadsheet. In the future, blockchain applications are likely to have an increased impact on agriculture, asset management, insurance, healthcare, retail, and supply chain management, to name a few areas.

Therefore for retail investors, companies that work with blockchain technology may be appropriate businesses to do due diligence on. Their shares may potentially be worthy additions to long-term portfolios.

For example, the Energy Web Foundation is working with energy giants, including BP (LON: ), Centrica (LON: ), and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), to explore how blockchain technology can be used in the energy sector.

Several big pharma companies, such as AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, have been collaborating to promote and cut the cost of drug discovery through increased use of blockchains.

Some global banks, including HSBC Holdings (LON: ), Lloyds and Santander (MC: ), are researching the potential use of blockchain-based banking solutions.

Grocery stores and food manufacturers, such as Sainsbury’s and Unilever (LON: ), are exploring how blockchain could help them keep track of food in the supply chain.

Put another way, I expect to hear the word ‘blockchain’ more often in the near future. And I expect many FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies to embrace this new technology.

Investing in FTSE shares My Motley Fool colleagues regularly cover FTSE shares and funds that you could consider adding to a diversified retirement portfolio. They point out that the despite various downturns and even crashes, over the long run, stock markets in the UK return about 6% to 8% annually, on average.

Research also shows that investors who purchase dividend-growth stocks and reinvest the dividends to buy more shares are likely to see considerable growth in their savings.

By Carolina Mandl and Tatiana Bautzer

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Lack of financing for the buyers of Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA: ) refineries may extend the delay in the sale process, three people with knowledge of the matter said.

Petrobras, as the company is known, had already extended the deadline for delivery of binding offers for the eight largest, first lot of refineries from early April to early June, following a plunge in oil prices.

Petrobras referred to the latest filing postponing the bids, in which it didn't´t give a new firm deadline. But at the time, sources with knowledge of the matter said the bidders were given additional 30 to 60 days to deliver the binding offers.

Now, the groups interested in acquiring the refineries are facing tougher financing conditions for their bids, that may be worth more than $10 billion.

Banks are more reluctant to finance deals in the refining business due to uncertainty over fuel demand.

Ultrapar Participações SA (SA: ), Raizen - a joint venture between Cosan SA and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), United Arab Emirates' state investor Mubadala Investment Company and China's Sinopec presented non-binding offers in the first phase of the sale process.

So far, Petrobras has not changed is still officially keeping the deadline and committing to a sale this year, but the lack of financing may force the company to postpone it again.

Field visits for due diligence in the refineries have also become more difficult due to the risk of the spread of the novel coronavirus, adding to reasons for another extension in the long-awaited sale process.

Earlier this year, before the pandemic, U.S. major Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ) was in talks to join one bidder group, two people with knowledge of matter said. But the company reported a loss in the first quarter and cut expenses and expansion projects. Exxon declined to comment.

Petrobras has faced challenges in its bid to reduce debt, which was at $87.1 billion at the end of 2019, after oil demand plunged amid worldwide social distancing measures and lockdowns.

Earlier in April, the company scrapped its 2020 debt reduction target due to market volatility.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusive-lack-of-financing-for-buyers-may-extend-delay-in-petrobras-refineries-bids--sources-2117258,0.087,0.856,0.057,-0.9304

By Michael Kahn, Anna Koper and Alan Charlish

PRAGUE/WARSAW (Reuters) - As the COVID-19 pandemic wipes out jobs and empties offices across the world, companies in Central Europe that provide remote, lower-cost services for multinationals are emerging as winners in the new business order.

From Prague and Warsaw to Bucharest, these firms have long provided outsourced or offshored business services such as software development, administration, payroll handling and research for big European and American customers. Now they are bucking the global trend by expanding and hiring.

""In a time of crisis, more business is shifting here,"" said Roman Pavlousek, who runs a finance service centre for global industrial manufacturer Atlas Copco (ST: ) in the Czech city of Brno. ""This is happening.""

Indeed, more than 90% of business services companies in the Czech Republic have continued to recruit during the pandemic, with 12% winning extra work from the Asia-Pacific region, according to a survey by the Czech branch of the Association of Business Services Leaders trade body.

While service centres in Asia can offer lower costs, Central and Eastern Europe offers geographical and time-zone proximity to western Europe and North America, with a deep pool of multi-lingual workers, business leaders told Reuters.

The region has drawn a host of big names, from Air France-KLM's (PA: ) BlueLink International to Exxon Mobil (N: ). It also boasts expertise in automation, robotics and artificial intelligence - areas where corporate decision makers are increasingly looking to expand, the leaders said.

In Poland, emerging Europe's biggest economy, business services companies have also kept the ""For Hire"" sign out as they continue to bring in new employees.

Iwona Dudzinska, managing director at Citibank Europe's service centre in Poland, said the crisis had not slowed its growth plans.

""We are hiring around 100 people every month and conducting recruitment online,"" she told Reuters.

'ALL ABOUT TIMING'

The business services sector has grown from almost nothing 25 years ago to an industry employing nearly 750,000 workers across Central and Eastern Europe, and it is rapidly expanding, said Romek Lubaczewski, a partner at PwC, who predicted a short-term bump in the road for the sector.

""It is all about timing,"" he added. ""This crisis has shown that more things can be done remotely and this will benefit the region in the medium to longer term.""

Lubaczewski lives in the bustling university town of Krakow, whose 85,000 employees in the sector makes it Europe's biggest business services centre hub.

Pepsico (O: ), Shell (L: ), State Street (N: ) and other international companies have set up shop in the southern Polish city, tapping into a multinational workforce able to deliver complex services in numerous languages.

""When you are sitting in a country that doesn't speak English, central Europe holds a massive advantage,"" Lubaczewski added.

The novel coronavirus pandemic has devastated global economic activity due to government-imposed lockdowns aimed at containing an outbreak that has led to more than 4.2 million infections and over 285,000 deaths.

The Czech report from the Association of Business Services Leaders found that most companies see new business opportunities arising from the crisis as customers restructure, cut costs and look for new ways to do business.

""The opportunities we are talking about lay in the fact we are in the business of centralizing activities, finding synergies and running efficiencies,"" said Pavlousek, who runs Atlas Copco's services centre.

RISK MODELLING

Pawel Michalik, managing director of ING Tech Poland (AS: ), said the pandemic would result in multinationals looking to outsource or offshore services in new areas.

""This is something that will affect the entire industry, and it will definitely have a positive impact on business service centres in the region,"" he told Reuters.

""Banks may be more willing to outsource certain services such as risk modelling and regulatory reporting,"" he said. ""We launched such services last year in Warsaw and we will probably develop them faster than we originally planned.""

The region's business services sector has been able to adapt to the requirements of national lockdowns better than most industries around the world.

Given the digital nature of their work, two-thirds of the sectors employees in Poland were able to work from home even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Now with far more than that number away offices, companies aim to keep many workers at home even once the crisis passes, according to the national Association of Business Services Leaders.

A widely expected increase in digitalization and a smaller emphasis on face-to-face contact by companies around the world, even after the pandemic, will further benefit Central Europe as a services hub, business leaders and analysts said.

""It's going to be a chance for more companies to move work here as they are closing down their main operations in other more expensive countries,"" said one worker at UBS in Krakow. ""It's happening, it's going to accelerate.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/for-hire-central-europes-business-services-firms-spy-a-chance-in-crisis-2117819,0.046,0.902,0.052,0.5831

FTSE 100 dividend cuts: BT and Shell join the club, so here’s what I’m doing

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BT -0.71% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Most of the worries on the part of stock investors recently have come from falling share prices. If you bought a stock at a particular price at the start of the year, on average you would be down 25%. Yet concern is now starting to come from income investors, due to the amount of FTSE 100 dividend cuts.

Income investing has the primary aim of generating money from dividend payouts. As a general rule, the percentage yield you get from these dividends is usually higher than the interest rate you could get on a Cash ISA or elsewhere. This makes sense, given that you also take on a higher risk by investing in a stock (as the share price fluctuates on a daily basis).

More FTSE 100 dividend cuts Several big names have over the past few weeks announced a full or partial dividend cut. Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) cut the planned dividend to investors by two-thirds. This is the first cut since World War II, and is noteworthy given the size of recent payouts from the firm.

Added to this was BT. The telecommunications firm announced a suspension of the dividend for two years. It’s hoped that the saving from this will help a cost-savings drive of around £3.3bn.

Not all bad news In my opinion, there are two ways of playing the dividend cuts. One way is to buy the firms that have cut dividends, aiming for share price appreciation. The other way is to buy shares in firms that still pay a dividend, for income investing.

The first idea comes from the thinking that cutting the dividend is good for the long-term health of the business. If BT manages to pull off the £3.3bn cost-savings initiative, then chances are the slimmer, more efficient company will be in a position to pay out dividends in two years’ time. The cost-savings drive will enable the firm to cut legacy parts of the business that aren’t that profitable. It will also help to focus on what really is the priority (consumer, small business, large business).

So buying in to the firms now could present a good longer-term buy. There will be no dividends in the interim, but any decent share price move higher should easily cover this.

Buy safe alternatives If you’re purely looking for income, then there are still some options out there to pick up FTSE 100 dividend-paying firms. I recently wrote about four good ideas, which you can read in full here.

One example I wrote of was Legal & General. The insurer has committed to paying out the dividend for this year, totalling around £753m. Whether new investors can buy in for future dividends remains to be seen. But if it did commit to paying more dividends further into the future, then the dividend yield of around 8% makes it a good buy.

Overall, you can’t hide from big names pulling dividends. But by thinking a little outside the box, you can still find good investing opportunities.

Is the Royal Dutch Shell share price a good buy?

BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LCO -0.11% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio CL -0.17% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio USO +0.21% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE:RDSB) shocked the energy world earlier this month when it cut its dividend in the wake of the oil crisis and coronavirus pandemic. The Shell share price plummeted following the announcement.

Dividend cuts seem normal of late, given the unprecedented times we are living in. Nonetheless, Shell’s cut was surprising because it had an unblemished 75-year record of never having decreased its dividend. Its decision marked a severe change of pace for the oil industry.

Oil price volatility So why did it do it? Shell requires an oil price of around $36 a barrel to break even. Earlier this year, the price of oil approached $70 and many projections based future earnings on prices in this region or higher.

Several factors then came into play, but the oil price has been below the break-even benchmark for several weeks now.

In the US, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price is the one that matters, but in the UK, it is the Brent price, which is primarily sourced from the North Sea. prices have been more resilient than WTI lately, but both tend to rise and fall in tandem. Brent Crude has been as low as $16, and at one point WTI went negative.

The recent area lockdowns and travel bans have reduced global oil demand by nearly a third. Although the lockdowns are gradually being lifted, it is unlikely demand will return to pre-pandemic levels quickly.

Lord Browne, former CEO of BP (LON: ), recently said he expects WTI could see negative prices again in the coming months as futures contracts come to fruition and the storage dilemma continues to weigh heavily on the US shale industry.

The severe fluctuations in the price of WTI will probably affect Shell’s US onshore production (but it is worth noting that it is the independent oil companies that are most at risk).

Geopolitical tensions Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, the US and China were embroiled in a trade war. The US had also ramped up tensions with Iran.

Despite the world’s focus being on the coronavirus crisis, these geopolitical tensions are still running high.

And the climate change crisis continues to put pressure on the industry too so oil companies will have to adapt to survive.

Onwards and upwards Nevertheless, the oil industry is still necessary and will continue to be so for many decades to come (probably on a smaller scale than we are used to, but producing, nonetheless). This makes me wonder, which oil stock is best positioned to survive the turmoil and navigate the choppy waters successfully?

Personally, I think Shell will be fine. The oil price is likely to climb as the US reins-in production. It has a price-to-earnings ratio of 10 which is half that of BP and around a suitable value point as advocated by Warren Buffett.

If you are a long-term holder, with the ability to resist selling when the share price falls and to let the good times run, I think the Shell share price is a good buy.

Although its dividend cut was a shocker, it has a 3.5% yield and a substantial track record. It will have a rough ride ahead, but I think for the long term that Shell will survive.

Why I’d invest £1,000 in the BP share price today

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio LCO -0.11% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

The oil price has picked up in the past couple of weeks, though not by much. Crude now fetches just $30 per barrel, which is at least better than April’s $20 levels. But it seems of little comfort to BP (LSE: LON: ) shareholders. The BP share price has crashed 33% since the beginning of 2020, a good bit worse than the 100‘s 20% fall.

Does that mean we should be forgetting the big losers like the BP share price? Should we be buying those with gentler falls? Or stocks that have actually risen? Buying more defensive stocks can be a good move. But I think it would be a mistake to dismiss big fallers like BP.

Governments are loosening Covid-19 lockdowns gradually in a number of countries. But oil demand is surely not going to rise significantly until we see a large-scale return to work and the restart of major industries. And until the travel industry, which is a big consumer of fuel, gets off the ground again.

When is all that likely to happen? It’s way too early to tell. But I think we can pretty much write off the rest of the year as far as oil demand goes. That’s unless OPEC can get its act together and restrict production further, and get the world supply glut down a bit. But I’d expect even that to only have a relatively small effect, and I don’t see a big BP share price boost any time soon.

Dividend at risk And while I’m being pessimistic, I see a possible reason to steer clear of the BP share price for a while longer. That’s the dividend. Analysts’ forecasts now suggest a 10% dividend yield this year, and it would dwarf whatever earnings the company is likely to report.

When the previous oil price crash was with us, we had Bob Dudley at the helm of BP. He warned us that the price crunch was likely to last a number of years. That was more pessimistic than many observers, including me, expected, but he was right. Despite that, he also assured us that BP was not going to cut its dividend, and it didn’t. Without providing the same assurance, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) also kept its dividend going throughout the crisis.

This time, we have no Bob Dudley, and no such assurance. And Shell has already cut its dividend, which led to a sharp drop in its share price. Shell shares have slumped further than the BP share price, losing a whopping 43% so far this year.

BP share price I see a good chance the BP dividend will be cut. But if that happens, I reckon any resulting share price fall could provide us with one of the best share buying opportunities of the year. I do see the BP share price as too cheap now, based on the long-term recovery in oil and share prices that I think is inevitable.

But added to that, a dividend cut could plunge the markets into further pessimism. And that could be the perfect time to buy. Be “greedy when others are fearful,” Warren Buffett has famously urged us. I think it could soon be time to do exactly that.

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There’s one hope for oil market bulls facing into the abyss of the 9.3 million barrels-a-day demand slump from the spread of Covid-19: The aftermath will see a renaissance in car-driving.

“People will use public transport less” because of fears about picking up infection on crowded trains and buses, Cuneyt Kazokoglu, head of oil demand analysis at energy consultancy FGE, wrote in the Financial Times this month. “Increased reliance on cars once the lockdown measures ease will support petrol demand, potentially for years to come.”

There’s an intuitive logic to that proposition, and even signs that it might be backed up by data. Chinese cities are already seeing traffic jams on a par with pre-coronavirus times, according to data from TomTom International BV. With the pandemic still raging, the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s weekly petroleum status report has been showing a pick-up in gasoline consumption since its lows last month, though it’s still running 40% below where it was a year ago.

Unfortunately for oil bulls, there have been plenty of other incidents in recent decades which might have made people give up public transport for cars — and in every case, the impact has been brief and limited.

In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome swept through Hong Kong. Public transport usage certainly dipped during the outbreak’s peak months, but soon resumed its upswing. Until last year’s protests and the latest coronavirus put a dent in things, patronage on the Mass Transit Railway was running at around double pre-SARS levels.

You saw a similar picture after terrorist attacks on rush-hour public transport in Madrid in 2003 and London two years later. Ridership dipped temporarily, but cars failed to capitalize on the shift. In London, cycling and overground rail were probably a greater threat to the Underground’s share. The sarin gas attacks in Tokyo in 1995 made barely any perceptible difference to public transport use, even in the short term.

That shouldn’t be very surprising. People don’t pack themselves into crowded commuter carriages for the pleasure of it, but because it’s by far the most convenient way of getting around most cities. Finding a substitute for public transportation is so difficult that closures of Hong Kong’s MTR last year were occasionally enough to shut down anti-government demonstrations by stopping protesters from getting there. Many cities actively discourage cars. In some, you have to get on a waiting list or pay handsomely for a license to own a car, or find yourself restricted to driving on particular days of the week.

It's far easier to put on a face mask and take care to wash your hands than to change the shape of your daily commute. To the extent that personal work habits change at all, it’s far more likely that the millions currently working from home will find ways to avoid rush-hour travel altogether.

That should be troubling for oil producers. As my colleague Julian Lee has written, there are more and more signs that oil demand is approaching a peak far sooner than the dates in the 2030s used by most analysts. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden, for one, thinks we may have already passed that point.

In rich countries, oil demand peaked all the way back in 2005, and the International Energy Agency expects consumption of gasoline, which makes up the largest slice of the barrel, to peak in the late 2020s even under current policies.

If anything, we're likely to see more people switch away from driving in the near future. A greater distance of metro rail is being built in the decade through 2022 than in the 150 preceding years, mostly in Asia. Electric cars and ever-tightening fuel efficiency standards are also ensuring that the cars on the road use less and less fuel.

Even BP (NYSE: ) Plc, which could be expected to take a bullish view of things, sees just 2.3 million barrels per day of road fuel demand growth between now and a peak in 2035. Over the past decade, that segment grew by 7.8 million daily barrels.

With the lockdown likely to put a hole in jet fuel demand for the next couple of years, the window in which oil demand might resume its upward growth before starting terminal decline is looking perilously short. Oil producers shutting down output to cope with the current supply glut may find they never get a chance to reopen.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shell Midstream Partners (N: ) said on Thursday it is offering storage in its Mars Sour crude cavern on the U.S. Gulf Coast, as offshore producers are not cutting output like onshore shale drillers despite the oil price downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

storage has quickly filled since measures to stem the spread of the virus chopped about 30% off of global fuel demand, sending prices crashing into negative territory last month. As a result, traders have been willing to pay high premiums to store barrels.

Because offshore production is not as easy to bring offline as short-cycle oil output like shale, some of that crude is going into storage. Overall U.S. Gulf Coast storage is 60% full, according to U.S. Energy Department figures.

Officials with the Houston-based affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L: ) did not specify how much storage will be available.

""Wherever we have a barrel of storage, we're pulling that because storage is a hot commodity right now,"" Kevin Nichols, Shell Midstream's chief executive officer, said on the company's first-quarter earnings call.

Pipeline volumes fell modestly in the first quarter.

First-quarter volumes were 537,000 barrels per day (bpd) on the Mars pipeline system, only slightly less than 539,000 bpd from the prior quarter, the company said. The system can handle 600,000 bpd.

The 163-mile (262-km) pipeline originates roughly 130 miles offshore, transporting production from the Mississippi Canyon-area to salt dome caverns in Clovelly, Louisiana.

Shell's Zydeco pipeline, which delivers crude to St. James and Clovelly, Louisiana, from terminals in Houston and Nederland, Texas, logged volumes of 669,000 bpd in the current quarter compared with 698,000 bpd.

Shell is moving ahead with a Mars system expansion, which it expects to come online by mid-year 2021.

Officials declined to provide specific rates for the newly-added storage.

Prices of medium sour crude grades, such as Mars Sour, have held up better than light sweet grades, company officials said. That is because there is less supply for sour and heavier crudes than light sweet grades. Refiners need heavier, sour grades for blending for diesel or other products.

Offshore drilling is also benefiting from access to export terminals and U.S. Gulf refiners, Shell said.

""The Gulf of Mexico has held up, comparatively speaking, to onshore shale,"" Nichols said.

The company's first-quarter revenue fell to $121 million from $126 million (102 million pounds) for the prior three months.

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 closed nearly flat on Wednesday as record gains for healthcare stocks offset growing evidence of the economic damage from the COVID-19 pandemic and escalating U.S.-China tensions.

The blue-chip index ( ) rose just 0.1%, with drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc (L: ) providing the biggest boost after it won U.S. approval for its diabetes drug as a treatment for heart failure.

The wider pharma & biotech index ( ) rose 2.9% to touch a record high.

The domestically focussed midcap stocks ( ) fell 0.7% along with broader European equities as worrying economic data and doubts about the easing of lockdowns weighed on investors' mood.

Data released earlier showed Britain's construction sector in April suffered by far its biggest contraction since the launch of a survey of the industry 23 years ago as the lockdown shuttered building sites and suppliers.

The British government is expected to lay out plans to relax coronavirus-induced restrictions on Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, adding that he hopes some measures could come into force the next day.

""At the moment, it can be said that the pandemic has been brought under control to some extent, although the way back to normal life is likely to be a very long one,"" said Milan Cutkovic, market analyst at AxiCorp.

Mall operator Hammerson Plc (L: ) plunged 14.3% to the bottom of the midcap index after saying it had terminated its 400 million pound ($497.20 million) deal to sell seven retail parks to private equity firm Orion.

Shares in other real estate firms, including Derwent London (L: ), Land Securities (L: ) and Intu Properties (L: ), fell between 2.9% and 3.4%.

Oil companies, banks and travel stocks were among the biggest drags on the blue-chip index.

The FTSE 100 kicked off May on a dour note last week following a strong rebound in April as investors feared the halt in business activity due had pushed the global economy into a deep recession.

The scale of damage will become evident when the Bank of England publishes its quarterly projections after the monetary policy meeting on Thursday, although policymakers are expected to refrain from further action after they cut interest rates to a record low in March.

Simmering U.S.-China tensions also added to the downbeat mood after U.S. President Donald Trump urged China to be transparent about the origins of the coronavirus.

Among gainers, online supermarket Ocado (L: ) jumped 5.6% after saying that its retail revenue soared 40.4% year-on-year so far in the current quarter on higher demand for home deliveries.

British broadcaster ITV (L: ) tacked on 3% after announcing cost-cutting plans even as its ad revenue plunged 42% due to coronavirus crisis.

Many of the shares income-focused investors have traditionally relied on for dividends are now cutting the payout. Shell (LON: ) is a prime example. Across the , established companies’ management has felt the need to preserve cash.

In this environment, and with dividends still an important source of overall returns, I’m turning my attention to two shares that combine income and share price growth potential.

A growth and income share Moneysupermarket (LSE: MONY) provides investors with a dividend yield of 3.7%. This was covered by earnings 1.6x, meaning the payout doesn’t seem in immediate danger of a cut. Many other companies have cut the dividends partly because of very low dividend cover, meaning that a hit to earnings severely affected their ability to pay shareholders. Not good news.

Looking more at the growth potential, I see this coming from an improvement in its money division, despite having seen revenues decline. This was due to reduced demand for consumer credit. The lockdown may well have changed that, giving people more time to address their finances.

Between 2018 and 2019, revenue and earnings per share both rose by 9%, while pre-tax profit rose by 10%. This shows the ability of the business to keep growing, albeit not at breakneck speed.

The business is well-established, which partly explains why growth is steady rather than blistering. It’s also highly profitable, which strikes me as a combination that could power future rises in the dividend and the share price.

With the shares now not far off where they started the year, I think now could be an ideal time to buy the shares. Both for the income and the share price growth potential.

A star share from the Ashtead Group (LSE: LON: ) has been a brilliant investment for many years. It’s thought of as a highly cyclical business prone to following the overall stock market’s ups and downs. No surprise then it’s had a tough start to 2020.

Management has been stress-testing the group’s finances. It believes under all the scenarios played out, Ashtead will have positive cash flow. Given a business can’t survive without cash, this is reassuring.

Ashtead is expecting underlying pretax profit for the year ending 30 April to be about £1.05bn, up from £947m a year earlier. The business then is in reasonable shape and highly profitable.

A price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio of 0.3 indicates the shares have a lot of potential for growth and could be undervalued. The P/E is also under 15, indicating the shares are looking cheap.

The business makes most of its money in the US, so watching what happens there will be key to determining what might happen to revenues and profits.

There’s no doubt this share price is a risk if coronavirus spikes again and the market crashes as a result. However, if the market continues to pick up, the shares provide a growing source of income alongside plenty of upward share price potential.

‘Britain’s Warren Buffett’ is the nickname given to portfolio manager Nick Train, who co-manages a number of top-performing equity funds. He is generally regarded as one of the UK’s top stock pickers. Indeed, his performance track record is so impressive that ‘Britain’s Warren Buffett’ seems like a fair description.

This year, Train has been buying a number of stocks for his portfolios amid the coronavirus-related market volatility. If you’ve some money to invest right now, I think it could be worth looking at what the portfolio manager has been buying.

Train loves this Warren Buffett-type stock One of the first stocks Train bought when stocks began to wobble earlier in the year was alcoholic beverages champion Diageo (LSE: LON: ). This is a FTSE 100 firm Train is a big fan of. Today, it’s the second-largest holding in his Global Equity fund, and the fifth-largest holding in his UK Equity fund, according to data from Hargreaves Lansdown (LON: ).

It’s not hard to see why Train likes Diageo (and why Warren Buffett himself might like it if he bought UK stocks). Put simply, it’s a classic Buffett-type stock. Not only does it have a strong competitive advantage due to the power of its brands (Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Tanqueray, etc) but it’s also highly profitable. In addition, it’s a reliable dividend payer with a superb long-term track record of generating shareholder wealth.

Diageo shares have actually continued to fall since Train was buying earlier in the year. This means you can pick the shares up at a lower price than he paid.

Personally, at the current valuation (trailing P/E ratio of 21), I think Diageo shares look attractive right now. Covid-19 is certainly going to set the company back in the short term, however, the long-term growth story associated with emerging markets growth remains intact.

FTSE 100 profits powerhouse More recently, Train has been buying shares in financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL). Late last month, Lindsell Train Limited increased its ownership of the FTSE 100 stock from 12% to 13%. That means ‘Britain’s Warren Buffett’ spent somewhere around £70m on Hargreaves Lansdown shares. Clearly, he’s confident in the outlook.

I can see why Train likes Hargreaves Lansdown. Like Diageo, it’s very much a Buffett-type stock. For a start, the company is one of the most profitable in the entire . Last year, return on capital employed (ROCE) – a key measure of profitability – came in at 69%. By contrast, the five largest non-bank companies in the FTSE 100, AstraZeneca, Unilever (LON: ), Shell (LON: ), GlaxoSmithKline, and British American Tobacco (LON: ), averaged a ROCE of 11%.

Secondly, it’s the leader in the investment management platform industry with a market share of around 40%. This provides a competitive advantage.

Third, the long-term growth story here looks attractive. We all need to save and invest more for retirement and Hargreaves should benefit from this. On top of this, rising stock markets should boost assets under administration in the long run.

Hargreaves Lansdown shares are currently down about 25% this year. At today’s prices, the trailing P/E ratio is about 28. At that valuation, I see the stock as a ‘buy’.

Dividend cuts! Could the BP share price be next?

UK100 -0.30% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

So far, the BP (LSE: LON: ) share price has held up well in the current stock market crash. Unlike many other companies, the oil major has not cut its dividend. Even though income fell precipitously in the first quarter of 2020.

But now that the company’s close peer Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) has cut its dividend for the first time since World War 2, BP could decide to act.

BP share price pressure BP’s profit fell by two thirds in the first quarter of 2020. The company struggled with falling oil prices and falling demand for its hydrocarbon products as the coronavirus crisis hammered the global economy.

The company reported an underlying replacement cost profit of $800m for the first quarter. That’s down from $2.4bn a year earlier.

The BP share price held up relatively well after these disappointing results as management committed to its dividend. BP maintained its dividend and continued to repurchase shares in the first three months of 2020.

This is good news for income investors, but it could signal problems further down the line. The BP share price currently supports a dividend yield of 10.5%. That is around double the FTSE 100 average and extremely attractive in a current interest rate environment.

However, with income falling, the business is struggling to meet its payment obligations. Debt rose to its highest level in 2015, as income slumped and BP filled the gap between income and spending with borrowing.

Rising debt Group debt rose to $51.4bn in the first quarter. The BP share price’s debt-to-capital ratio hit 36%, up from management’s target of below 30%.

Management is trying to reduce the pressure on cash flows by cutting capital spending. The company slashed its 2020 budget by 25% to around $12bn. This should offset some of the decline in earnings.

Nonetheless, it doesn’t seem sensible for the company to be borrowing more money to sustain its dividend. This could lead to further problems down the line if BP has to slash spending drastically to meet its obligations to creditors. This could have a significant negative impact on the BP share price in the long run.

BP also needs to focus on increasing its investment in renewable energy. The business cannot do this if it is returning all available cash flow to shareholders. If the company wants to remain relevant for the long term, it will need to increase renewable energy investment.

As such, it looks as if BP could be the next firm to cut its dividend. The company cannot continue to pay out more than it can afford indefinitely. Sooner or later, this will become a problem for business.

On the other hand, a dividend cut might be hurt the BP share price in the near term, but it could lead to increased income and capital gains for investors over the long run.

With the stock market crash causing share prices to plummet across the board, many investors have been tempted to look elsewhere to build wealth.

Over the past month, the price of has surged by around 27%, massively outperforming the . Although I expect this could continue over the short term, in the long run, I think cheap FTSE 100 stocks offer a better, and much safer, prospect of wealth creation.

When share prices are especially volatile, it can be easy to start doubting the stock market’s ability to bring long-term capital growth. But don’t lose heart, the market always recovers and more often than not, rebounds to make new highs.

The appeal of cryptocurrencies Much of the attention that virtual currencies receive is around their supposed ability to make you money quickly. I’m sure you’ve heard the stories of people becoming millionaires practically overnight from their savvy investments in Bitcoin.

Though this is entirely possible, it’s also true that you could lose that money just as quickly as you gained it. Exponential increases and decreases in the span of just weeks or months are a regular occurrence in crypto markets.

A quick glance at Bitcoin’s price chart illustrates this strikingly. The volatile swings upwards and downwards demonstrate a price that is purely based on investor sentiment, rather than any form of intrinsic value.

Truth be told, it’s impossible to determine Bitcoin’s prospects. In my view, its potential to replace traditional currencies seems low. To ever be used on a large scale, an overhaul of monetary systems around the world would be required.

Ultimately, spending money on a speculative asset doesn’t appeal to me. I think there are better ways to get rich and retire early.

Cheap FTSE 100 shares Speaking of which, I think investing in cheap FTSE 100 shares offers the prospect of financial freedom over time.

The stock market sell-off has left many FTSE 100 shares trading below their historic average valuations. As well as indicating a wide margin of safety, I think this presents an ideal opportunity for investors to grab a few bargains.

In my eyes, there’s a large amount of choice regarding cheap FTSE 100 shares at the moment. Personally, I’m keeping my eye on a handful stocks. These include Taylor Wimpey (LON: ), Imperial Brands (LON: ) Group, Unilever (LON: ), Aviva (LON: ), and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ).

Opportunities to buy cheap shares are usually few and far between for investors. The last time a sell-off happened on a similar scale was during the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. With that in mind, I wouldn’t pass up on the offer of buying bargain shares today.

Hold for the long term Once you’ve cashed in on some cheap FTSE 100 shares, I recommend holding them for the long term. Investors who do so almost always fare better than investors who try to time the market and make a quick sale.

Moreover, riding out the temporary market downswings usually generates better returns over the long run. Remember, selling low crystallises a loss. Whereas, holding for the long term allows time for the market to recover and for your investments to bounce back.

Ultimately, I think buying cheap FTSE 100 shares and holding them for the long term is a superior way of boosting your chances of getting rich and retiring early.

Is the Shell share price a bargain?

SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Investors have been rushing to sell the Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) share price in the past few weeks. Sentiment towards the company has deteriorated rapidly after the business decided to slash its dividend for the first time since World War 2.

However, while this action has dented the Shell share price’s appeal as an income investment, it could have improved the group’s long-term prospects.

Shell share price value Before the company announced its decision to reduce its annual dividend, Shell was on track to return a total of $15bn to investors this year. According to analysts, the new dividend will save the business $10bn a year. That’s a substantial figure, and it gives the company much more financial flexibility, which could be positive for the share price in the long run.

The Shell share price is currently facing several significant headwinds. For a start, the coronavirus crisis has caused hydrocarbon demand around the world to fall by around 30%. This has sent energy prices plunging to the lowest level in several decades.

The firm is also having to deal with the environmental crisis. The company has committed to reducing its carbon footprint substantially over the next few decades, an ambition that’s helped the Shell share price.

As part of this goal, management is hoping to increase the group’s involvement in the global electricity market. It’s not possible to establish the price of this initiative right now. But Shell is already promising to spend around $2bn, or 10% of its capital budget, on low-carbon initiatives.

The company has no choice in this matter. The world is moving away from dirty, polluting fuels. The business has to adapt to this new normal, or the Shell share price could suffer in the long run.

Debt problems The combination of falling oil prices and rising capital spending demands present another problem for the group. Its borrowing has increased over the past 12 months.

This is yet another situation that Shell has to adapt to, or it could suffer in the long run. The business cannot continue borrowing more and more money forever. Sooner or later, creditors will start asking tough questions. That might be bad news for the Shell share price.

As such, management’s decision to cut the dividend now, rather than trying to muddle through, seems to be the right decision. It will free up billions of dollars every year to help the company reduce debt, and meet its green goals.

This could help the company grow over the long run. What’s more, the recent dividend cut leaves the Shell share price yielding around 3.6%. That’s still attractive in the current interest rate environment. The dividend also looks more sustainable.

The bottom line All in all, while disappointing, it looks as if management’s decision to cut the dividend was the right one. Shell now has an estimated $10bn of extra cash to reinvest back into the business. This could help accelerate the company’s earnings growth and lead to capital gains over the long term.

Therefore, now could be an excellent time for long-term investors to snap up the depressed Shell share price. As the company progresses with its transformation plans for the 21st century, shareholders can also look forward to that 3.6% dividend yield.

Why I think Royal Dutch Shell (and these other stocks) could struggle in a post-Covid-19 world

SHEL +0.34% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

It looks likely that Workspace Group (LSE: WKP) is in for a lot of pain following the Covid-19 crisis. The business has already had to offer customers affected by government-imposed quarantine measures a 50% reduction in their rents. Lockdown measures will be loosened at some point, but the office space provider is set to suffer from falling client demand in the upcoming recession too.

The impact of the coronavirus breakout threatens to damage revenues at Workspace over a much longer timeline. Why? Well the need for millions of workers to clock in and operate from home has likely quickened the rate at which the home working revolution will being adopted.

Companies the world over are already putting systems in place that will enable their employees to perform remotely in case of another crisis like the one Covid-19 has created. It’s a development that has made shared work spaces and centralised offices that bit more redundant. I don’t think that a slightly-elevated forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of above 20 times reflects Workspace’s muddy earnings outlook, in both the near term and beyond.

Stay out of Town Town Centre Securities (LSE: TOWN) is another property owner that stands to lose from a likely surge in remote working in the wake of the coronavirus. The prospect of subdued demand for its office space is only one part of the problem for this small-cap though.

Retail assets and car parks form significant parts of Town Centre Securities’ bricks and mortar portfolio too. They are properties which have suffered a significant drop in footfall during the ongoing lockdown. And they are assets whose long-term outlooks have taken a whack because of the mass adoption of e-commerce by housebound Britons.

Most recent data from the British Retail Consortium shows that online sales in March rocketed 18.8% on an annual basis. The internet has long cast a shadow over the likes of Town Centre Securities. But the Covid-19 tragedy has exacerbated its troubles as new users flock to do their shopping online.

I don’t care about this stock’s low forward P/E ratio of around 11.5 times. It’s a share whose long-term profits outlook is becoming increasingly scary.

Another Covid-19 crisis Fossil fuel producers like Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) also stand to suffer in the post-coronavirus landscape. It’s not just a near-term demand crash that they need to fear either. It’s a renewed drive to cut greenhouse gasses in the wake of the pandemic.

Experts have noted that some of the areas most affected by Covid-19 happen to be some of the most polluted, like Wuhan in China and Lombardy in Italy. It’s a connection that scientists made during the SARS outbreak at the beginning of the century too. And it’s a theme that could see global governments become even more determined in their drive to cut carbon footprints.

Shell’s forward P/E ratio of 23 times is sky high considering its growing profits problems, though its reduced 3.6% dividend yield takes the edge off a bit. Still, it’s not a share I’ll be touching with a bargepole. I’d much rather invest my money elsewhere.

(Reuters) - They range from simple spray-painted circles on the ground in a Mogadishu market to bright and breezy floor stickers in a Dubai mall, which blow a kiss and urge: ""Hey there beautiful, don't forget to keep a safe distance.""

The markings that will oblige us to keep apart in busy social settings, in order to prevent transmission of the new coronavirus, are appearing on shop floors, city pavements and train or tram platforms the world over.

As people emerge from weeks of lockdown, they face an array of new measures to try and keep the virus in check and protect society's most vulnerable.

The signs mounted so far went up at speed - but look likely to become commonplace and could be in use for years.

Dots on the ground, lines, squares within squares, love hearts and smiley faces are being used around the world. The markings need to be impactful enough to be adhered to, but also, ideally, to reassure people without making them feel cattle-driven.

""Anywhere where there are graphics at the moment, it is because people have had to react super quick and put something in place - speed has been of the essence. We are now at the point where there is a bit of breathing space,"" said Chris Girling, Head of Wayfinding at CCD Design & Ergonomics in London.

We have a hotchpotch of styles, colours, terminology, scale and placement strategies, he notes. ""This means every single time a member of the public enters a different space they are having to relearn the rules.""

There is a balance to be found, he said. ""People want to feel safe, reassured and at ease. If you can do that, they are in turn going to be more likely to shop, feel relaxed and return. The message needs to be clear and consistent ... and absorbed.""

PLEASE

Levels of politeness vary in the places where retailers, city and transport authorities have been able to afford to print special signs.

""For your safety please stand 2 metres from other people,"" reads a floor sign in a Shell (LON: ) petrol garage in Britain.

""Please practice social distancing,"" reads another alongside footprints in Santa Monica, California.

""Stand here"" is written in English on a red circle floor sign in a grocery shop in Beirut.

""If we are using words like 'stop' and 'go' and more abrupt language, then that is more associated with hazard and prohibitive signage. This (COVID-19) is a very different type of situation and one that people have never experienced before, so it warrants a different tone of voice,"" said Girling.

""It is definitely worth trying a more friendly and inventive touch with how you talk to your customers or the general public as they are likely to be more receptive... there is even a bit of space for humour.""

Footprints have proved popular so far, in signs from Bury in Britain to Abidjan in Ivory Coast, but as Girling points out, the best sign systems would also encourage linear movement and give a visual understanding of direction.

Asked how he would design a social distancing system, he suggested a line of tape to show a pathway, which changes colour every two metres.

""The instinct to follow a line from childhood naturally stays the same as we become adults, and you subconsciously pick up on these visual cues as you walk around environments.""

Signs related to COVID-19 should also ideally have their own distinctive colour, which will become instantly recognisable.",https://uk.investing.com//news/world-news/social-distancing-signs-around-the-world-show-the-new-normal-2114728,0.002,0.842,0.156,0.9985

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top oil and gas companies, which account for roughly 7% of global crude consumption, have committed themselves to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets which vary in scope and detail, making them hard for investors to compare.

Graphic: European oil companies - share of global consumption - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8805/8786/Pasted%20Image.jpg

Many climate ambitions among oil majors relate to results three decades into the future and depend on carbon offsets, whose availability is finite, and carbon capture and storage, a technology not currently deployed at commercial scale.

What does this mean, say, for the carbon footprint of a car driver at a petrol station?

If we take BP (LON: ) as an example, emissions from its own barrels, from wellhead to passenger car exhaust, amount to around 415 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year.

BP says it will reduce these emissions - roughly the same as Britain's annual emissions - to net zero by 2050.

The net zero target does not cover crude and refined products that BP trades but which are initially brought out of the ground by other producers, a total which is much larger than the oil and gas BP produces itself. It says it aims to halve the carbon density of all energy that it trades by 2050.

Graphic: BP's greenhouse gas emission targets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8806/8787/BP%20emissions%20targets.jpg

BP's peer Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) has the oil and gas sector's broadest plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, although it depends on pivoting ""towards serving businesses and sectors that by 2050 are also net-zero emissions"".

This means Shell relies on its customers' choices to reach its aim.

Graphic: Shell's climate ambition - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/ygdpzeekvwa/Shell%20climate.png

French major Total pledged to cut to zero the greenhouse gas emissions from its operations, such as oil fields, globally by 2050. Such emissions from a group's operations and from the electricity used for them are also known as Scope 1 and 2.

But its broader 2050 net zero carbon plan covering emissions from fuels made from the oil and gas it extracts, such as gasoline, and sold to customers - also known as Scope 3 - only applies to Europe.

Graphic: Total's climate targets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/yzdvxoxmqpx/Total's%20climate%20targets.png

As for emissions from its global fuel sales, it wants to reduce the carbon intensity of energy products used by Total customers by 2050 to less than 27.5 grammes CO2 equivalent per megajoule.

An intensity-based target allows for absolute emissions to increase if volumes sold go up.

Equinor has also pledged to halve the intensity of the energy products it produces and sells by 2050, but its methodology is based on its equity oil and gas output, rather than every drop of fuel it sells.

Eni, conversely, committed to cut its absolute emissions from all products it sells by 80% and said its oil output would shrink from 2025.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - France's Total SA (PA: ) is seeking to expand its power retailing business in Australia from the middle of this year as part of a global plan to sell electricity to 9 million sites by 2023.

Total already sells power to the Gladstone liquefied (LNG) project, in which it is a stakeholder, and wants to supply electricity to other large customers across Australia's eastern states, it said in an application to the Australian Energy Regulator.

""TGPAU's proposed target market is the very large customer end of the market (for example industrial and government customers),"" Total Gas & Power Australia (TGPAU) said in its application.

As of 2018, Total said it sold 37 terrawatt hours of electricity to more than 5 million customers and traded 250 TWh of electricity in 11 countries.

(Bloomberg) -- Few have a better watchtower over oil demand than Joe Gorder, chief executive officer of major U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp (NYSE: ). But this week Gorder didn’t even need his business insight to know that fuel consumption was starting to recover in America.

He only needed to look at the streets of San Antonio, the Texas city where he’s based, to see traffic emerging after weeks of lockdown.

“People are starting to get out more,” Gorder said. “I think there probably is a pent-up demand for folks to get out of their houses and get mobile.”

From the streets of San Antonio to Barcelona and Beijing, traffic data, sales at fuel stations, and pipeline flows all suggest that the slump in oil demand probably bottomed out around the middle of April, and has now started a modest -- and very tentative -- recovery. The signs matter beyond the petroleum industry as they provide a glimmer of hope after a torrent of negative economic data.

“I believe we have seen the bottom,” said Marco Dunand, co-founder of Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., one of the world’s top-5 oil trading houses.

But the recovery is extremely slow. Oil traders believe it’s likely to take more than a year, and perhaps much longer, before global demand reaches the pre-pandemic levels of roughly 100 million barrels a day. A growing minority even speculate it may never get there again.

The likely shape of the revival has been a hotly contested topic. A V-shape was discarded a while ago. It’s possible it could be U-shaped, with a relatively long period along bottom, or L-shaped, with demand never returning to where it once was.

Perhaps the Latin alphabet doesn’t have a letter for the right shape. The square-root mathematical symbol may offer, to a point, an alternative: first a V-recovery as lockdowns are relaxed, followed by a long, flat tail as lifestyle changes, such as more work-from-home, become more normal.

‘Bumpy Road’

Certainly, airlines don’t expect a return to the 2019 level of demand for years to come. It’s what Ed Morse, a veteran oil watcher at Citigroup Inc (NYSE: )., calls “the winding, bumpy road to an oil recovery.”

The sheer scale of the demand destruction -- about 30 million barrels a day in April -- means the comeback is going to be a painful process. The International Energy Agency estimates that consumption will be down 25.8 million barrels a day in May, and 14.6 million in June. In December, it would still be 2.7 million a day below 2019 levels.

“We’re seeing improvements really across all three markets, we’ve seen in May volumes trending up in Europe, we see that happening in the U.S., and we see that also in Asia,” Darren Woods, CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: )., told investors on Friday. “There are some, I’d say, encouraging early signs.”

The very gradual improvement comes just as producers, from the OPEC+ alliance to drillers in Texas, accelerate their output cuts. Together they could progressively push supply and demand into balance over time. In the past week, more companies, including big American firms such as ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ), have announced fresh production closures.

“Globally, we are at the inflection point where we are past the worst for oil demand destruction but not for supply destruction,” Olivier Jakob, managing director at consultant Petromatrix GmbH. “This should help price stabilization.”

The process will take time, with unsold crude and oil products likely to accumulate well into June and perhaps even July. Storage tanks are nearly full, and brings with it the risk of New York crude gyrating wildly again when the June futures near expiry in the middle of this month, mirroring what happened when the May contract ended and sent prices below zero.

Even so, the physical oil market, where actual barrels change hands, is showing tentative signs of recovery, particularly in Europe. Urals, Russia’s flagship export grade, has risen to a premium over Brent after Moscow cut exports to a 10-year low.

Recovery Epicenter

The epicentre of the oil recovery is the same as where the public health crisis started in January: Wuhan. Weekday traffic in the Chinese city has almost returned to pre-crisis levels, although it remains depressed on weekends. It’s completely back to normal during rush hour in other major cities including Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, according to data from navigation company TomTom International BV.

“There are a few green shoots in some places like China,” said Jessica Uhl, finance head at Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc. “We have some of our retail stations where demand and volume is up above pre-Covid levels.”

Some of these shoots are also visible in one of the most battered industries -- aviation. Commercial operations worldwide are recovering slightly, with Flightradar24 data showing 33,500 flights taking off on April 30, the most in a month. However, that’s still two-thirds lower than from before the pandemic. Most airlines do not plan to fly again until July at the earliest.

In the oil industry itself, the recovery is patchy, and many worry that it could quickly reverse if a second wave of infections hit after lockdowns are relaxed. Diesel, which fuels trucks and industries, is holding up better than gasoline, which is doing a lot better than jet-fuel. Even when demand strengthens, crude consumption may remain low because refiners will have first to get rid of the millions of gallons of oil products that have piled up over the past weeks.

Murky Details

As with many economic indicators, oil demand data comes with a significant lag. So traders rely on proxy estimates for a near real-time view. One is highway traffic. Another is the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s trucked out from pipeline terminals into fuel stations.

In the U.S., the amount of gasoline supplied to the market increased last week to nearly 5.9 million barrels a day, up from 5.1 million in the first week of April but well below the typically more than 9 million before the virus, according to the official data. Early last month, refiners saw gasoline demand at 55% of normal level, which improved to 64% in the latest seven-day average. Valero confirmed on Thursday that it’s seeing some pick-up.

“I do think we’re going to see more activity,” Valero’s Gorder said.

Spain, which had one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe, offers a rare window into real-time demand as the nation’s biggest pipeline operator is disclosing weekly information. CLH Group said gasoline demand in the week to April 26 was down 75% from a year ago, a slight improvement from 81% in mid-April and 83% in late March.

In the U.K., demand for road fuels is currently down between 55% and 60% from levels before the crisis, compared with 65%-70% two weeks ago, according to the Petrol Retailers Association.

The data show that the recovery is only marginal. But it also indicates that consumption has, at the very least, bottomed out. Where demand goes, prices follow, and Torbjorn Tornqvist, head of commodity trading giant Gunvor Group Ltd, thinks the worst of oil’s slide is over.

Echoing a widely held view in the market, Tornqvist warns, however, that these subdued prices and demand may remain for a while. Prices aren’t likely to go much above $40 a barrel before the end of 2021, Tornqvist said. Only four months ago, at the start of this year, benchmark was near $70.

“It’s going to take a long time to balance the market,” he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) advertising campaign promising customers they can ""drive carbon neutral"" has been deemed acceptable under Britain's advertising rules following an investigation, regulators said on Wednesday.

The Anglo-Dutch oil major said in October that it would become the first petrol retailer in Britain to offset the carbon dioxide emissions from customers' fuel purchases at its service stations at no extra cost by backing forestry schemes.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said in March it had launched a formal investigation into the campaign after receiving complaints from the public who thought it was misleading given the role of oil in driving climate change.

The ASA said it had since carefully assessed eight complaints and responses from Shell.

""Based on the content of the ad and our understanding of the scheme, and the work we have already carried out in this area, we concluded the ad was unlikely to mislead consumers,"" said Matt Wilson, the ASA's media and public affairs manager.

Like other carbon offsetting schemes, Shell's offer rests on the principle that companies can neutralise the impact of their emissions by paying to support forests or other ecosystems capable of absorbing an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.

Critics of the schemes say they give the false impression that it is possible to take meaningful action to slow global warming without following the advice of climate scientists to rapidly scale back the use of all fossil fuels.

Last week, the ASA said it had informally resolved complaints against an advertising campaign by Saudi Aramco (SE: ) after 61 people registered their objections to its use of the word ""sustainability"" in the context of the oil industry.

""We approached the advertiser with the concerns that had been raised. In its response to us, Aramco confirmed that it had withdrawn the campaign,"" Wilson said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/uk-watchdog-deems-shells-drive-carbon-neutral-ad-campaign-acceptable-2112611,0.041,0.889,0.069,0.6705

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil and gas output from some of the world's top oil companies is set to drop by over 12% in the second quarter of 2020 to levels not seen in at least 17 years, according to Reuters calculations.

The output cuts are driven by an unprecedented drop in oil consumption due to coronavirus-related movement restrictions that have led to a surge in supplies and a collapse in crude prices to levels not seen in more than two decades.

Four of the top publicly-traded oil and gas producers, known as oil majors, have in recent weeks outlined plans to sharply reduce production from Iraq to the shale basins in the United States.

""Our output will be down in the second quarter, and it is very uncertain how the rest of year will unfold,"" BP (LON: ) Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney told Reuters last week.

BP said it will reduce its U.S. shale oil output by 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2020, around 14% lower than its 2019 output of 499,000 boepd.

It is also cutting in other countries, including in OPEC nations and other major producers including Russia and Azerbaijan that agreed in March to cut output by an unprecedented 23%, Looney said.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said that in some cases the production cuts are due to logistical problems such as lack of storage.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ) and Chevron Corp (NYSE: ) are slamming the brakes on oil output, as the top two U.S. producers plan for combined global shut-ins of 800,000 barrels per day in response to plunging crude prices and fuel demand.

Both companies on Friday outlined deep cuts in investments in the Permian shale basin, the top U.S. oilfield where growth in recent years made America the world's top oil producer and a net exporter for the first time in decades. They each announced global shut-ins of up to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) this quarter due to lockdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

Exxon and Chevron have been sidelining Permian drilling equipment since the market started crashing in March. prices have plunged nearly 70% this year to under $20 a barrel, and traded in negative territory on April 20 for the first time ever.

Oil and gas output at both U.S. producers rose in the first quarter with the companies racing to produce 1 million barrels per day in the Permian. Then fuel demand sank nearly a third due to travel and business lockdowns, while a flood of Russian and Saudi oil hit the market when they abandoned production cuts.

""We would intend to bring activity back to the Permian when we see prices recover,"" Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview.

The two oil majors spent heavily in the last two years to expand in the Permian. Shale production can be brought on faster than deepwater and other oil exploration projects but requires near-constant drilling to maintain output.

Exxon's biggest cuts will come in the Permian, ""where the short-cycle investments are more readily adjusted,"" said Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods.

He added that because shale wells produce big volumes at first and then decline rapidly, it is ""beneficial in long term"" to ensure ""we're bringing those high production rates into a market that's more conducive."" Exxon will sideline 75% of its Permian drilling rigs, keeping 15 working.

The company posted a $610 million (488 million pounds) first-quarter loss, its first quarterly loss in three decades, on a nearly $3 billion inventory writedown reflecting lower margins and prices. Chevron posted a $3.6 billion profit on asset sales and improved refining results, and also said it would further reduce spending this year.

(For a graphic on Exxon's earnings, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/3aTTnrp)

Both companies will slash spending budgets by 30% this year. Chevron cut its capital spending budget to $14 billion and Exxon has set 2020 spending at $23 billion, the lowest in four years.

Even though their results topped Wall Street's reduced estimates, Exxon shares fell 7% to $43.14 while Chevron dropped 2.8% to $89.44.

Chevron’s additional spending cuts will help it pay for its dividend and make it ""a defensive energy holding and a relative safe haven in very stormy seas,"" said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones.

Exxon’s balance sheet ""is strong enough to withstand the current environment,"" but it needs oil prices around $75 per barrel this year to break even versus around $50 on average for its peers, said Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited.

U.S. crude futures have recovered a bit since settling in negative territory on April 20, but the current price of around $19 per barrel remains below the cost of production for many. International oil prices are around $26 per barrel.

Both Chevron and Exxon maintained their quarterly dividends.

Other oil majors are also slashing investments and seeking ways to conserve cash. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two and reported first-quarter profits down nearly half compared to a year-ago. BP (LON: ) Plc's first-quarter profit tumbled by two-thirds and its debt climbed to its highest on record.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exxon-chevron-slam-brakes-on-shale-as-oil-demand-tumbles-2109715,0.085,0.841,0.074,-0.7845

(Reuters) - A surge in big oil companies boosted Britain's FTSE 100 on Tuesday, with investors counting on a revival in economic activity as several countries emerged from coronavirus lockdowns.

Brent crude futures ( ) soared to more than $30 per barrel on hopes of a recovery in vehicle traffic and fuel demand, sparking a more than 5% gain in shares of BP (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ). [O/R]

The commodity-heavy FTSE 100 ( ) snapped a three-day losing streak with a 1.7% gain.

The domestically focused midcap stocks ( ) lagged with a 0.9% rise as the latest services sector activity data pointed to a 7% quarterly fall in Britain's gross domestic product.

Still, investors took comfort as countries including the United States and Italy gradually restarted their economies, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected this week to review his country's shutdown.

""As the UK reveals plans to exit lockdown and as other countries already begin to relax measures, attention is turning once again to a rebound in economic activity, with oil prices also bouncing,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.

The FTSE 100 has now recovered about 19% from an eight-year low that it hit in March, partly on historic global fiscal and monetary stimulus, and shrugging off mounting evidence of the COVID-19 pandemic's economic damage.

Figures earlier on Tuesday showed British new car sales slumped by an annual 97% in April as factories shut because f the coronavirus outbreak. The United Kingdom has the highest official death toll from the coronavirus in Europe, overtaking Italy.

MANILA (Reuters) - Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp (PS: ) said on Tuesday it will shut down its 110,000-barrel-per-day Tabangao refinery in the Philippines for one month from mid-May as the coronavirus pandemic has hammered oil demand.

""In response to the drastic decline in local product demand and the significant deterioration of regional refining margins brought about the COVID-19 pandemic, the company will temporarily shut down its refinery operations for approximately one month starting mid-May 2020,"" the unit of Anglo-Dutch energy firm Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) said in statement.

Pilipinas Shell said it will continue to comply with the government's minimum inventory requirement during the shutdown of the refinery in Batangas City, south of the capital Manila.

Manila and some parts of the main island of Luzon as well as a few other Philippine provinces will remain under ""enhanced community quarantine"" until May 15 to curb the coronavirus spread.

""The temporary shutdown will help insulate the company from further potential drops in refining margins and will also aid in its cash conservation initiatives,"" it said, adding that it can switch to importation of petroleum products if necessary.

Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday temporarily increased tariffs on imported and refined petroleum products to fund measures aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

Investing.com -- What could be worse for the stock market’s spirits than the resumption of a trade war and the crippling of Europe’s crisis response? While neither is real yet, the coming week will show how present the risk is.

On Sunday, President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo both launched attacks against China for its perceived role in unleashing the pandemic, Trump in particular highlighting the possibility and desirability of punishing it, not least through the imposition of new tariffs.

By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the benchmark was down 3.6% at 327.86, its lowest in over a week, making April’s rebound look more than ever like a bear-market rally. The German , Europe’s best performer in April, was down 3.7%, while the was the outperformer, falling only 0.5% thanks to some strong performances by virus-beating stocks such as Rentokil (LON: ) (office cleaning) and Reckitt Benckiser (LON: ) (disinfectants) and to the stabilization of index heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and BP (NYSE: ) after last week’s bloodbath.

There is evidence to suggest that the coordinated media blitz is an exercise in diverting attention rather than an earnest threat: the Trump administration has temporarily waived tariffs on a large range of Chinese imports since the crisis began, afraid of burdening U.S. consumers with higher prices as tens of millions lose their jobs or suffer cuts to their income.

“If President Trump’s attempts to get re-elected continue to rely on attacking China, investors will worry about whether this will bring additional costs to specific U.S. firms,” UBS Wealth Management chief economist Paul Donovan said in a morning note.

Pompeo, meanwhile, told ABC at the weekend that there was “significant evidence” that the Covid-19 virus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, without actually presenting any of that evidence – an approach that worked for his predecessor Colin Powell in rallying public opinion before the invasion of Iraq 17 years ago, but which may be difficult to repeat, given how that turned out.

While U.S.-China tensions have kept their ability to terrorize global markets, the more immediate threat to European markets is a more local one. On Tuesday, Germany’s Constitutional Court is set to give its final ruling on the legality of the European Central Bank’s asset purchase programs.

A couple of months ago, this looked likely to be waved through with little more than the usual grumbling from a court which has already backed away twice from challenging the ECB head-on.

However, the ECB last month cast aside all the restraints on its bond-buying that it had previously adopted to placate its German critics. That raises the risk of the judges handing down a ruling that could stop the German central bank from participating in QE, damaging the credibility of a policy that is the centerpiece of the euro zone’s crisis response.

This being the euro zone, the likeliest outcome is still a fudge that puts off answering the hard question – how willing are Germany and the rest of northern Europe to accept liability for their brethren in the weaker periphery of the euro zone.

Even so, it’s more than enough to keep markets on the defensive after a month-long rally that has found little justification so far in companies’ quarterly reports: data from Refinitive suggest that first-quarter earnings will be down 25% on the year for Stoxx 600 companies. The second quarter, of course, is likely to be much worse.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-trump-german-court-cast-a-long-shadow-over-stretched-markets-2110624,0.118,0.841,0.041,-0.9942

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Coronavirus concerns prompted organizers on Sunday to cancel one of the world's most prestigious gatherings of oil ministers and top executives from the energy and financial industries scheduled for this month in Houston.

The fast-spreading virus has infected around 85,000 and killed almost 3,000 people around the world. About 70 cases have been diagnosed in the United States, which recorded its first fatality from the virus over the weekend.

The CERAWeek energy conference is the latest event to be scrapped due to the disease, which triggered the biggest weekly stock market rout since 2008 last week. Stock markets continue to fall on Monday, but oil prices edged higher in trading in Asia on expectations OPEC will cut output. Oil fell around 15% last week.

In its decision to cancel CERAWeek, consultancy IHS Markit noted that border health checks are becoming more restrictive and companies have begun barring non-essential travel to protect workers. In addition, several countries have sidelined events likely to draw large crowds.

IHS Markit separately cancelled two other international conferences scheduled this month in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Long Beach, California.

CERAWeek, first held in 1981, has in the past drawn thousands of attendees to Houston and its energy panels and technology forums. Some 5,500 delegates from 85 countries took part last year at the week-long event, according to the event's website.

The loss of this year's event will remove one chance for oil and gas executives ""to discuss how to deal with declining demand caused by the virus epidemic"" as it bears down on the industry, said Francisco Monad, a fellow in Latin American energy policy at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.

The oil and gas industry is already battling a sharp slowdown because of the virus. The International Energy Agency last month said in an updated outlook that it was expecting global oil demand growth this year to fall to its lowest level in a decade.

Global oil prices have plummeted more than 25% this year as investors fear demand destruction from the virus. had traded as high as $68.91 a barrel in January, before the virus outbreak was acknowledged.

In previous years, CERAWeek has been a major economic boost to the city of Houston, filling hotels and driving business at restaurants and shops.

""It's the most important yearly gathering of the industry, in which many significant deals and conversations take place,"" Monad said.

There were no incidents in Houston that led to the decision to cancel the event, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and IHS Markit Vice Chairman Daniel Yergin said in a joint statement.

IHS Markit estimated that the cancellation of the conferences, including CERAWeek, would have a financial impact of about $50 million of non-recurring revenue, its website said.

This year's CERAWeek was expected to draw delegates from more than 80 countries, the company had said, although visitors from some countries were already unable to attend.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top oil and gas companies, which account for roughly 7% of global crude consumption, have committed themselves to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets which vary in scope, timelines and detail, making them hard for investors to compare.

European oil companies - share of global consumption: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8805/8786/Pasted%20Image.jpg

And what does this mean, say, for the carbon footprint of a car driver at petrol station?

If we take BP (L: ) as an example, emissions from its own barrels, from wellhead to passenger car exhaust, amount to around 415 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year.

BP says it will reduce these emissions - roughly the same as Britain's annual emissions - to net zero by 2050.

The net zero target does not cover crude and refined products that BP trades but which are initially brought out of the ground by other producers, a total which is much larger than the oil and gas BP produces itself. It says it aims to halve the carbon density of all energy that it trades by 2050.

BP's greenhouse gas emission targets: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8806/8787/BP%20emissions%20targets.jpg

BP's peer Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), has also pledged to halve the carbon intensity of products it trades by 2050. An intensity-based target allows for absolute emissions to go up if volumes sold go up.

Shell's 2050 carbon ambition: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8812/8793/Pasted%20Image.jpg

Equinor (OL: ) has also pledged to halve the intensity of the energy products it produces and sells by 2050, but its methodology is based on its equity oil and gas output, rather than every drop of fuel it sells.

Eni, conversely, committed to cut its absolute emissions from all products it sells by 80% and said its oil output would shrink from 2025.

All these targets depend at least partially on offsets, whose availability is finite, and carbon capture and storage, a technology not currently deployed at commercial scale.

Still, European oil and gas producers' climate ambitions are way ahead of their U.S. peers ExxonMobil (N: ), Chevron (N: ) and ConocoPhillips (N: ).

LONDON (Reuters) - Catholic religious order Jesuits in Britain will ditch fossil fuel companies from its $500 million equity portfolio by the end of the year, it said on Wednesday, citing corporate failure to respond quickly to the threat of climate change.

Asset managers responsible for more than $14 trillion (£10.7 trillion) have divested from the sector in recent years, though many more prefer to remain invested and engage with companies to change their business strategies.

Some companies have sought to address investor concern, including BP's (L: ) pledge this month to reduce its carbon emissions, though critics have said that such measures have not gone far enough.

Jesuits in Britain, which has 400 million pounds invested with three money managers to finance its work, said it is more than halfway through the process of selling out of its holdings in oil majors BP , Shell (L: ) and Total (PA: ).

""Our trustees took the decision to completely divest from oil, gas and coal-producing companies because they felt these companies were not making enough progress towards better solutions,"" said Stephen Power, a Brother in the Society of Jesus, which manages the group's ethical investing strategy.

The Jesuits had considered outright divestment for a decade, but until now had opted only to restrict investment in companies with large holdings in thermal coal or those using Canadian tar sands, Power said.

With diversified energy companies BP and Shell, the order had focused on encouraging the companies to follow a ""greener and more future-focused policy"".

""However, the severity of the climate emergency has made it crystal clear that action is needed more than words if climate action is to be effective,"" Power said.

A spokesman for the order said its main equity investment managers are AXA Framlington Investment Management, CCLA and Cazenove Capital Management.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/jesuit-order-to-ditch-fossil-fuels-from-500-million-equity-portfolio-2059468,0.041,0.889,0.07,0.8395

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Oil and gas company Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Dutch gas company Gasunie plan to build a massive green hydrogen plant in the northern Netherlands in the next decade, the companies said on Thursday, to cut emissions.

Fuelled by a large new wind farm off the coast of Groningen province, the plant would ultimately be able to produce 800,000 tonnes of hydrogen by 2040, the companies said, cutting the Netherlands' CO2 emissions by about 7 megaton per year.

The companies expect to start a feasibility study this year, while they seek other industrial and energy partners to join.

""In order to realise this project, we will need several new partners,"" said Shell Netherlands director Marjan van Loon.

""Together we will have to pioneer and innovate to bring together all the available knowledge and skills.""

The plant would use a water electrolysis unit to convert sustainable electricity into hydrogen, which can then be stored for reconversion into power or for direct industrial use.

Its capacity would be roughly equal to the hydrogen produced by now used by industrial factories in the Netherlands, helping the Dutch to reach their target of reducing CO2 emissions to 49% of their 1990 level by 2030.

The small but densely populated Netherlands still has the fifth highest level of CO2 emissions per capita in the European Union, while deriving just 7% of its energy from renewable sources.

Shell and Gasunie's plans, however, are still in an early stage and depend, among other things, on government permits, the assignment of new wind farm locations in the North Sea and the availability of Dutch and European subsidies for green energy.

The project envisages a wind farm that would grow from a capacity of 3 gigawatt (GW) to 4 GW in 2030 to possibly 10 GW by 2040, sufficient to meet the current electricity consumption of about 12.5 million Dutch households.

The first wind turbines could be ready in 2027, Shell and Gasunie said, and would be used to start the production of green hydrogen in a large plant in the town of Eemshaven and possibly also in facilities at sea.

The hydrogen would then be carried by Gasunie's existing pipelines to industrial customers in the Netherlands and northwest Europe.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/shell-and-gasunie-plan-to-build-massive-dutch-green-hydrogen-plant-2060721,0.007,0.952,0.041,0.8922

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's advertising watchdog has opened an investigation into claims by Shell (L: ) that customers at its petrol stations can ""drive carbon neutral"", after receiving complaints from members of the public, the regulator said on Monday.

The challenge to Shell's flagship promotion underscores the dilemmas oil and gas majors face as they seek to market their products despite increasing global concerns about the role of fossil fuels in driving climate change.

Shell said in October that it would become the first petrol retailer in Britain to offset the carbon dioxide emissions from customers' fuel purchases at its service stations at no extra cost by backing forestry schemes.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it began an investigation into radio advertisements for the promotion after 17 listeners complained that they found them misleading.

""We've launched a formal investigation into whether the radio ad clearly discloses enough information in relation to this offer and will publish our findings in due course,"" said Freddie Alcock, a media officer at the ASA.

Last year, the watchdog approached Norwegian oil and gas company Equinor (OL: ) after receiving a complaint over an advertisement by the company on the London underground that implied was a ""low-carbon"" energy source.

The case was resolved informally when Equinor, which had discontinued the campaign by the time the complaint was assessed, agreed not to repeat the claim in future campaigns, the ASA told Reuters.

The watchdog, which has the power to ban advertisements it deems misleading, did not make the content of the complaints against Shell available. The regulator will also hear from the company and a ruling could take some months to deliver.

""Prior to launching this to our customers we did a huge amount of work and due diligence on our Drive Carbon Neutral offer, and we are happy to speak to the ASA to answer their questions,"" said a Shell spokesperson.

Shell also referred Reuters to a company webpage https://www.goplus.shell.com/en-gb that offers a detailed explanation of how its carbon offset programme works.

Carbon offsetting rests on the principle that companies can neutralise the impact of their emissions by paying money to plant forests or restore other types of ecosystems capable of absorbing an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.

Critics of the schemes say that they give the false impression that it is possible to take meaningful action to slow global warming without following the advice of climate scientists to rapidly scale back the use of fossil fuels.

Shell sees its vast global network of petrol stations as key to its hopes of remaining profitable even if the world manages to rapidly transition to the kind of low-carbon economy needed to avoid worst-case climate change scenarios.

(Bloomberg) -- Oil majors including Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc are facing uphill battles to convince U.S. courts to enforce multi-billion dollar arbitration awards they secured against Nigeria’s state oil company.

The companies accused the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. of taking more crude than it was entitled to under four deals that were signed in 1993 to incentivise them to develop deep offshore blocks. Those projects today account for about 30% of the country’s 2 million barrels of daily output.

Independent arbitration tribunals seated in Nigeria sided with the companies and awarded them damages. But the NNPC successfully challenged the awards in the Nigerian courts, which ruled the disagreements were either tax disputes and not subject to arbitration, or the tribunals had no right to impose the penalties.

In September last year, the U.S. District Court for the Southern (NYSE: ) District of New York dismissed a lawsuit filed by Exxon and Shell units that aimed at enforcing a 2011 arbitration ruling requiring NNPC to pay them $1.8 billion for a contractual breach. Judge William Pauley noted that the companies had multiple appeals pending in Nigeria.

‘No Justice’

The companies have appealed the U.S. judgment, saying the Nigerian courts denied them due process by annulling the award and they are now owed $2.7 billion with accrued interest.

The case was filed in the U.S. because Nigeria’s courts have never ordered NNPC to pay monetary damages to a foreign plaintiff over two decades and lack “the political independence to render impartial judgments in a high-value dispute,” the companies said in a court filing. It could take at least a decade for Nigeria’s Supreme Court to adjudicate in the appeals process, “which renders the prospect of justice so illusory as to amount to no justice at all,” they said.

Umar Gwandu, a spokesman for Justice Minister Abubakar Malami, didn’t respond to a request for comment. NNPC must file its response to the U.S. appeal by April 10.

The companies “face a formidable challenge” to persuade a U.S. judge to reinstate damages already set aside by a Nigerian court, said Tafadzwa Pasipanodya, a Washington-based partner in Foley Hoag LLP’s international litigation and arbitration department.

Read more about another legal dispute has with the oil majors.

Separate tribunals in Nigeria instructed NNPC to pay a Shell-led consortium $1.4 billion in damages in 2013, and Eni SpA more than $500 million the following year, while Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ) and Equinor ASA secured a $1 billion award in 2015. Those awards were also set aside by the local courts.

Chevron and Equinor initiated their own proceedings in the Southern District of New York in March 2018 to enforce their award, with oral argument scheduled to be heard on April 20. Eni approached the same court in mid-2017, but suspended its legal action in November while Nigeria’s Federal High Court considers the matter.

While U.S. courts can enforce arbitration awards made and subsequently overturned in other countries, they “apply a strong presumption in favor of following the foreign court’s ruling,” according to Jonathan Blackman, New York-based senior counsel at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP.

The parties must show the decisions of the Nigerian judiciary were “repugnant to basic U.S. principles of justice and fairness or due process,” he said. “This is a difficult -- but not impossible -- standard to meet.”

Industry Support

The case brought by Exxon and Shell meets that threshold, according to the American Petroleum Institute, which filed a brief in support of the companies’ appeal. The conduct of Nigeria’s courts “runs contrary to central concepts of justice in the United States,” it said.

Spokesmen for Exxon, Chevron and Equinor said their companies don’t comment on ongoing litigation. Representatives of Shell, Eni and NNPC didn’t respond to requests for comment.

There is an example of an arbitration decision that went against Nigeria being enforced in the U.K., which threatens to put further strain on the nation’s already stretched finances.

In September, a British judge ruled that Process & Industrial Developments Ltd. can collect on a compensation award for losses incurred on an aborted gas-processing project in Nigeria -- a claim that now stands at $9.6 billion, or more than a quarter of the nation’s foreign reserves. Nigeria’s government, which is appealing that ruling, alleges the company paid bribes to secure the contract. P&ID denies any wrongdoing.

PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - The United Steelworkers union (USW) is considering designating a new lead negotiator in the National Oil Bargaining process, the union's president said on Wednesday, as current lead negotiator Shell cuts back on the number of refineries it owns.

Speaking at the National Oil Bargaining conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania USW International President Tom Conway noted that Shell Oil Co, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ), had publicly committed to reducing the number of refineries in its portfolio.

Shell has been the lead company in contract talks for U.S. union-represented refinery workers since the late 1990s. In that role, it has negotiated over national issues like wages and safety standards with the USW, used as a blueprint for the U.S. fuel and petrochemical industry. Site-specific issues are negotiated locally.

""The industry is changing,"" Conway told Reuters at the conference, adding that a number of refiners are being considered and the union has not yet decided on the lead company for 2022 contract talks.

Shell is trying to use its global scale to build a power business as the world moves toward cleaner energy. The Anglo-Dutch company has committed to selling more than $5 billion of assets per year in 2019 and 2020.

Most recently, Shell sold its refinery in Martinez, California, to independent refiner PBF Energy (N: ). Shell's refineries in Anacortes, Washington and Sarnia, Ontario, are also understood to be for sale.

Peer European oil major BP Plc (L: ) quit a major U.S. refining lobby last week, and only operates three refineries in the United States.

Meanwhile, independent refiners have been acquiring assets and adding refining capacity in recent years.

Since its $23 billion acquisition of Andeavor in 2018, Marathon Petroleum (N: ) can now refine more than 3 million barrels-per-day of .

The USW last year reached an agreement with Shell that boosts pay by 11% over three years for 30,000 U.S. refinery, chemical plant and pipeline workers.

Rolling strikes in 2015 left more than 7,000 workers at 12 refineries and three chemical plants off their jobs for between two to six months.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - World No. 1 oil producer Saudi Aramco (SE: ) is set to gain unconditional EU antitrust approval for its $69 billion buy of a 70% stake in petrochemicals group Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) (SE: ), people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

Aramco announced the deal to acquire the controlling stake from sovereign investor Public Investment Fund (PIF) in March last year, a move key to its diversification into refining and petrochemicals.

Riyadh-headquartered SABIC, the world's fourth largest petrochemicals group, has operations in over 50 countries.

(Bloomberg) -- A buyer of liquefied has canceled two cargoes from Cheniere Energy (NYSE: ), the biggest U.S. exporter, as a global glut pummels prices for the fuel and threatens to shut a key outlet for shale production.

Spanish utility owner Naturgy Energy Group SA (MC: ) has decided not to take delivery of two shipments from Cheniere, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The cargoes, one of which was scheduled for April delivery, were rejected by Naturgy’s clients Repsol (MC: ) and Endesa SA (MC: ), who had originally purchased the volumes from Naturgy and will now pay a fee, the people said.

Cancellations of U.S. cargoes were closely watched and highly anticipated amid a grim outlook on global prices. It could be an early sign that global oversupply is poised to hammer the U.S. gas market, which is already straining under the weight of a domestic glut. Prices in Europe and Asia collapsed as storage levels rose during a mild winter, making it tougher for LNG buyers to make a profit reselling U.S. cargoes abroad.

The coronavirus outbreak in China is stifling LNG demand from the world’s fastest-growing importer. While the Asian nation hasn’t directly imported any U.S. cargoes in more than a year amid trade tensions, the virus has contributed to the global price rout.

The virus has wreaked havoc on commodity markets from LNG to while disrupting global industrial production, travel and supply chains. As Chinese demand for the fuel declined, PetroChina Co. is said to have delayed discharge of multiple cargoes. Qatar and the world’s biggest LNG trader, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, said they’re working with customers to reschedule or reroute deliveries. While lower prices are opening up demand in places such as India and Turkey, they’re also testing Europe’s ability to absorb extra supply in a weak market.

“We are seeing supply reduction before demand maximization in Northwest Europe,” said Verena Viskovic, an analyst at BloombergNEF. Even with European benchmark Title Transfer Facility prices crashing more than a fifth since the start of the year, those TTF levels still “are not low enough to fully maximize gas-to-lignite switching,” she said.

At current forward prices of U.S. and European gas, the profit margins of delivering U.S. LNG to Europe and to Asia are thin, according to a BloombergNEF note this week. Exporters of U.S. LNG may be forced to keep gas at home during the next seven months despite the potential demand in the German power sector.

At least two Japanese buyers are also considering canceling cargoes from the U.S. that they had expected to load before summer, according to traders with knowledge of the matter, adding that no final decisions have been made.

LNG exports have been a relief valve for U.S. gas producers as output from shale basins soars to record highs. In the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where gas is extracted as a byproduct of oil drilling, prices have slid below zero amid pipeline bottlenecks; that means producers are paying others to take their supply.

More gas-fired power plants would have to be built in the U.S. and abroad to ease the current supply glut, said Campbell Faulkner, chief data analyst for commodities broker OTC Global Holdings.

“Prices globally are converging and until there is a boatload of new generation built domestically and abroad, there is just simply not much room in the market” for more gas, he said. LNG, once vaunted as a savior for the U.S. gas market, “looks to be a damp squib,” he said.

Cheniere, while declining to comment on specific commercial arrangements, said the flexibility its contracts provide is appreciated by customers and that the fixed-fee portion of the agreements ensures cash flow to the company even when a delivery is suspended. Naturgy and Repsol declined to comment. Endesa didn’t immediately comment.

Customers of the American exporter have to pay a fixed tolling fee to reserve capacity, whether or not they take the LNG. Contracts give offtakers an option not to lift cargoes but to do so, they need to notify the exporter 45 to 60 days before the delivery date and pay their fee.

The canceled cargoes were to be loaded from Cheniere’s Corpus Christi facility in Texas, the people said. Naturgy has said it also has a contract with the exporter’s second plant, the Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana. Naturgy has sold volumes from Cheniere to its own clients in advance, the people said.

“The market seems to be overreacting to the perceived contract risk to established LNG companies like Cheniere, who signed very favorable contracts when the market was short gas in the early 2010s,” Katie Bays, co-founder of Washington-based Sandhill Strategy LLC, said in a message.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/lng-cargoes-canceled-as-virus-compounds-us-export-glut-2056734,0.044,0.918,0.038,-0.1117

LISBON (Reuters) - Portuguese oil company Galp Energia (LS: ) said on Tuesday it will kick off its green business by installing renewable energy capacity of 10 gigawatts in the decade ahead.

Galp, which last month bought solar power projects from Spain's ACS (MC: ) for 2.2 billion euros (£1.8 billion), hopes to install 3.3 gigawatts of solar energy in Portugal and Spain alone by 2023, generating more than 10% in equity returns.

Fossil fuel companies are racing to adapt to investor-demands for more sustainable business models as public awareness of climate change grows.

Galp sees itself as well-placed to ""build a competitive renewable business"" from its location on the Iberian peninsula with its 1,800 solar hours per year.

From this year onwards, it said that more than 40% of Galp's capital expenditure, between 1 billion to 1.2 billion, will be spent on the energy transition, which includes renewable energy and a project in Mozambique.

Galp is the largest oil and gas group in Portugal, where it distributes gas and sells petrol.

Traditionally an oil refinery, Galp attracted interest from investors due to its growth prospects in oil and gas production in projects in Angola, Mozambique and Brazil, where China's Sinopec (SZ: ) has 30% of its assets.

Globally, it competes with majors such as Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), BP (L: ), Total (PA: ) and Exxon (N: ).

BP last week set one of the oil sector's most ambitious targets for curbing emissions, although some environmental campaigners accused it of greenwash and said it had not given enough detail on how it would achieve its targets.

AÑELO, Argentina (Reuters) - Just weeks into his young administration, Argentina's new president convened a meeting with executives from Chevron Corp (N: ), Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L: ) and other oil companies in a bid to smooth things over with an industry which he had slammed as a candidate months before.

Campaigning last year against the South American country's former market-friendly president, Alberto Fernandez had said there was no point in Argentina having oil riches if ""you have to let multinationals come and take it away.""

In a fence-mending session Jan. 16, Fernandez apologized to energy executives for the mixed signals, according to an industry source with direct knowledge of the meeting. Fernandez said he was intent on devising a recovery plan for the Vaca Muerta shale play in the Patagonian province of Neuquen, according to the source.

But Fernandez did not present a plan at that meeting, nor put forward his own thoughts, the source said, a sign that the new government had yet to settle on a course of action for ramping the Western Argentine shale deposit up to its full potential.

""They know what they are supposed to do … but they don't know what changes will make things better or worse,"" said another official at a U.S. service provider who declined to be named, adding that he had ""zero hope"" that Fernandez's promised bill would significantly improve the bleak outlook at Vaca Muerta.

When asked about the government's plan for the area and the meeting with executives, a spokesman for the energy secretariat said, ""Vaca Muerta is central as a country project at a global level.""

The presidency declined to comment for this story.

The success of Vaca Muerta, often compared to the Permian Basin in the United States based on its vast potential, is key for this South American nation that has failed for decades to break free of cyclical crises and is grappling with inflation above 50% and a $100-billion(£76.9 billion) pile of sovereign debt.

But more than a dozen interviews with energy executives, property developers, analysts and locals here in Añelo, considered the capital of Vaca Muerta, show how patience is running out for global energy giants including Halliburton Co (N: ) and Schlumberger NV (N: ) once committed to tapping the region's reserves, as well as the thousands of Argentines trying to scratch out a living in a region that was bustling just 12 months ago.

When 47-year-old truck driver Alberto Valenzuela came to Añelo, a once-thriving town, seeking opportunity and a better life, he started building his dream: a four-bedroom home with plenty of space for his wife and two children.

Now he and his family are moving on.

""I came to try my luck,"" Valenzuela told Reuters. But now, ""we cannot provide for ourselves with what little there is in this town.""

""NO LONGER A GOOD BET""

The remnants of Argentina's hope for a shale boom here can be seen on a dusty hilltop in Añelo, where Valenzuela is one of the 4,000 people who have helped double the town's population in five years.

Weeds sprout around clusters of empty, half-built houses alongside idled construction equipment. It is one of the many construction projects aimed at accommodating newcomers that stalled as investor confidence slipped in the tumultuous election season.

Rather than presenting a plan for boosting investments in Vaca Muerta or other projects, Fernandez asked the executives who attended the January meeting at the Casa Rosada presidential palace for their ideas on how to stimulate the energy sector, the source with direct knowledge said.

He pledged in the meeting to present a plan to do so in February, although there is no sign of it so far.

The executives asked the new president for a clearer legal framework, a right to send profits home, a reduction in red tape and the need to get rid of capital controls and a fuel price freeze, the sources said, measures enacted by Mauricio Macri in his final weeks in office.

For many in the industry, though, the damage from Fernandez's earlier broadside against oil multinationals is done.

""We had assets we were going to send down there. After those comments, everyone in the industry felt that Argentina was no longer a good bet. That equipment is still not down there,"" said another source at a U.S. energy firm, who added that the diverting of assets was driven by Fernandez's campaign comments.

Several key barometers of oil industry health have deteriorated in the region and work has gone with them in the last seven months, according to industry data and union officials.

By January, there were just 24 active rigs to extract unconventional oil and gas at Vaca Muerta, down 37% from the end of July, according to sector data by service provider Baker Hughes.

While production at Vaca Muerta hit records last year, analysts attributed the performance to a strong first half of 2019 and said a slowdown likely began in August, largely because of that month's shock primary election result in which Macri was sorely beaten by Fernandez.

""In 2020, it's going to be affected. By how much, we don't know,"" Martina Gallardo-Barreyro, a Latin American energy analyst for Moody's, said of production and activity.

The lull has hit international oil majors including Halliburton, which said in January that declining activity in Argentina had hurt its revenues. Rival Schlumberger is selling off parts of its local business amid what it has called ""muted"" activity and a difficult investment climate.

""HERE GROWS A DREAM""

The impact from the industry's Argentina crisis, which experts say stemmed from a lack of clarity on the rules of play as well as worries about the Peronist victory, is apparent on the ground in Añelo.

A large hand-painted sign that reads ""will sell or seeking investor"" is mounted on the front of Valenzuela's unfinished house.

Local officials tried to keep up with an influx that doubled the population to 8,000 within five years, but the town's development slowed to a crawl over the last seven months, entwined with the lower activity at Vaca Muerta.

Some oil majors and other stakeholders, including participants in the meeting, said in statements to Reuters they were optimistic that activity could still pick up at Vaca Muerta, citing its long-term potential.

German oil and gas company Wintershall DEA ( ), for example, said it had the ""clear expectation"" that price controls would be lifted in the short-term.

Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said that a ""stable, predictable and competitive business environment based on free market principles is essential to attract investment capital on the scale that is needed to ensure growth and expansion for the Vaca Muerta, a world-class shale play with long-term potential.""

But in Añelo, the picture is bleak. Packages of floor tiles lay in the dirt outside the unfinished structures of the hill-top housing development. Unused street lights are piled in a shed. Construction is well behind schedule with far fewer workers on the job, officials said.

In front of the empty shells of houses is a government sponsored sign that appears at many other dormant sites in the town. It reads: ""Here grows a dream.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/economy/argentinas-energy-bust-spawns-ghost-town-in-prized-vaca-muerta-2054798,0.049,0.839,0.111,0.9976

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell's (L: ) onshore Egyptian oil and gas assets have drawn interest from American, Egyptian, Asian and Middle East bidders, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Shell launched a process at the end of November to sell its onshore upstream assets in the Western Desert to focus on expanding its Egyptian offshore gas exploration.

It appointed investment bank Citigroup (N: ) to run the sale, which could fetch around $1 billion, a source close to the process told Reuters in November.

The oil major's Western Desert portfolio includes stakes in 19 oil and gas leases of which Shell's working interest included output of around 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day last year, Reuters reported at the time.

U.S. oil and gas producer Apache Corp (N: ), Egyptian firms Apex International Energy and Cheiron, and London-listed Pharos Energy (L: ) submitted bids, said the two sources close to the deal, declining to be named as the matter is not public.

There were other Asian and Middle Eastern bidders too, they said. One of the sources said all the bids were non-binding.

Shell, Citi, Apex, Apache and Pharos declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Cheiron did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The second phase will see companies short-listed for due-diligence and binding offers, one of the sources said.

The transaction could take a long time, both sources said, citing weaker gas prices and a lengthy process in Egypt since such assets require government approvals.

The second source said the deal was unlikely to close before May.

Egypt's oil and gas sector has seen a rapid expansion in recent years after the discovery of vast offshore gas reserves that has drawn major investments from international companies including Eni (MI: ) and BP (L: ).

At the same time, Egypt's aging oil and gas assets have changed hands.

(Bloomberg) -- As Asia-Pacific president of Inc (NYSE: ), one of the world’s biggest producers of plastics and chemicals, Jon Penrice has 100 billion reasons to recycle.

“About 8 million tons of plastics are going into the ocean annually,” he said in an interview. “If you look at plastic packaging, around 95% is not being recycled each year which is $100 billion worth of plastic, and that’s valuable for entrepreneurs.”

At the center of the effort is Asia, which consumes almost half of the world’s plastic packaging, according to BloombergNEF, and imports even more waste from the U.S. and Europe. Solutions -- such as Indian vending machines that turn plastic bottles into polyester, and researchers in Singapore who are working out ways to clean up oil spills using the waste -- will be needed to meet demand for recycled plastics that’s forecast to rise faster than supply.

The biggest challenge to the transition is to make recycled plastics at a price and quality that are competitive. Virgin plastic is derived from and is closely linked to the global oil price. Because the cost of recycled plastic is more stable, it becomes relatively more expensive when crude prices fall.

The complexity of sorting different types of plastic is another hurdle, according to Penrice, as well as dealing with waste at source rather than producing a lot of carbon emissions by sending it half way around the world.

An estimated $80 billion-$120 billion of value is lost because of packaging that goes into the environment, said Navneet Chadha, principal operations officer at the World Bank’s International Finance Corp., which helps fund private sector investment in developing countries. “We have to think of used plastic as a resource, not as a waste.”

But Chadha cautioned that standards for recycled products need to be developed to avoid “unintended consequences”. Using plastic in road construction, for example, needs to be evaluated further as microplastics may be generated as the road decays, he said.

Here are some of the ways plastic is being recycled in Asia:

Traditional Recycling

Plastic waste is traditionally reused by collecting and sorting refuse and then melting it, a process known as mechanical recycling. Part of the problem is that a lot of garbage is tainted with food or chemicals and can’t cheaply be turned into high quality raw materials.

“The biggest challenge is quality of recycled plastic,” said Jean-Marc Boursier, chief operating officer of SUEZ Group, one of the world’s largest recycling companies. “Major consumer goods companies like Danone, Pepsi or Coca Cola will not buy recycled plastic unless they are convinced that the quality is as good as virgin plastic.”

SUEZ has nine plants globally that can turn a combined 500,000 tons of waste plastic into 150,000 tons of polymers, used to make shampoo bottles, car interiors and other products. The company is opening its first Asian plastic recycling plant this year in Thailand.

Boursier suggests pricing the carbon savings into the recycled plastic price to take into account the environmental benefit.

Aerogels

A team of researchers at the National University of Singapore has developed a way to convert low-value plastic waste into aerogels -- ultra-light materials used in everything from diaper fillings to cleaning up oil spills.

Around eight average plastic water bottles produce a square meter sheet of aerogel using the method, said Duong Hai Minh, an associate professor at the university who worked on the project. The researchers have sold commercial production rights to firms including Bronxculture in Singapore and DPN Aerogel JSC in Vietnam, he said.

“People throw away plastic because there they don’t see any value,” Minh said. “As long as we can make it valuable, everyone will keep it and sell it.”

Highways

Using plastic waste to build roads is gaining in popularity, not least because all types of plastic including difficult-to-recycle multilayered packaging and flexible films and coatings used to wrap chocolates and for food deliveries can be used. Dow Chemical (NYSE: ) and India’s Reliance Industries Ltd (NS: ) have developed technologies that use this plastic as a binder, replacing some of the bitumen.

The Mukesh Ambani-led company has built 40 kilometers of road at its refineries using plastic that can’t otherwise be recycled, and is in talks with National Highways Authority of India and other road builders about using the technology more widely, said Vipul Shah, chief operating officer for the petrochemicals business.

Meanwhile Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (NS: ), the country’s biggest refiner, is trying to get the government to make the blending of non-recyclable plastics in road-laying mandatory, said S.S.V. Ramakumar, director of research and development.

In the Philippines, San Miguel Corp (PS: ) laid down its first road combining plastic scraps with asphalt last year, using surface material developed with . The chemicals giant has also helped build plastic-based roads in India, Indonesia, Vietnam and the U.S., according to Dow’s Penrice.

“It’s relatively simple from the technology point of view: you shred the plastic waste, some sorting and selection and then you feed it into the existing asphalt machinery,” he said. “Approximately 100 tons of plastic waste can be recycled into a 40-kilometer stretch of road.”

Textiles

Shredding plastic bottles to produce polyester for clothing is another technology that’s gaining traction in Asia. Reliance has set up reverse-vending machines that collect used bottles in exchange for discount coupons that can be redeemed at its company stores.

The company, India’s largest petrochemicals manufacturer, can recycle around 2 billion plastic bottles a year, or 33,000 tons, according to Shah. Capacity will be doubled over the next 18 months, he said.

Bricks

Some non-government organizations and companies are looking at ways to use waste plastic to make bricks and other construction materials. The Global Ecobrick Alliance is promoting use of a block tightly crammed with plastic and other recyclables. Qube, an India-based start-up, has developed a brick made entirely of plastic waste. Called the PlastiQube, it’s cheaper and uses less energy to produce than conventional counterparts, according to the company’s website.

Chemical Recycling

Breaking down waste plastic into a basic feedstock like naphtha -- a process called pyrolysis -- can reprocess dirty, contaminated plastics like detergent drums and mixed polymers that can’t be dealt with through mechanical recycling.

Pyrolysis will provide around 17% of the 19 million tons of plastics recycling capacity required by 2030 in major economies, according to BloombergNEF. Dow will source oil feedstock made using pyrolysis from Dutch company Fuenix Ecogy Group, while Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) PLC and Total SA (PA: ) have partnered with start-ups to increase use of the technology.

“Mechanical recycling will continue to be cheaper,” said Boursier at SUEZ, which is setting up a pyrolysis pilot project in Bristol in the U.K. “But for complex or polluted plastic, chemical recycling will be the future.”",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/diapers-to-bricks-a-100-billion-plastic-challenge-2052455,0.058,0.885,0.056,-0.9056

ROME/MILAN (Reuters) - The Italian government is leaning towards reappointing Claudio Descalzi as CEO of state-controlled oil firm Eni, provided he will work with a new board to speed up efforts to cut carbon emissions, four senior political sources told Reuters.

The largest member of the ruling coalition, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has been highly critical of the veteran oilman in the past, not least because he is being tried in Italy for alleged corruption over a 2011 oil deal in Nigeria. Descalzi denies any wrongdoing.

However, Rome is keen for an experienced leader with a track record of dealing with geopolitically sensitive areas such as Africa and the Middle East to oversee interests there, and to help Eni (MI: ) shift towards cleaner sources of energy without inflicting too much damage on profitability.

""No final decision has been made yet, but Descalzi has a good chance to be reappointed,"" a government member of the ruling centre-left Democratic Party (PD) said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Eni, a rich source of dividends for stretched state coffers, has traditionally been seen as a key piece of Italy's energy policy and also important for foreign policy because of its extensive overseas presence.

Descalzi's second term leading the company comes to an end in May and the government is expected to flag as soon as March whether or not he will be kept on. The 64-year old executive is due to present Eni's latest business plan on Feb. 28.

Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri, a PD minister, said on Friday that ""very valuable people"" were running state-owned companies, which also include utility giant Enel (MI: ) and defence group Leonardo (MI: ), but did not elaborate.

The 5-Star Movement is not opposing Descalzi's reappointment as long as he is prepared to work with a new board to accelerate moves to cut carbon emissions, a prominent member of the movement said.

""He is winning round key figures in the party,"" the official said, also asking not to be named.

The nomination process at Italy's state-controlled companies is traditionally the subject of intense political horse trading because of their size and importance. Talks usually go down to the wire and can change unexpectedly on political vagaries.

The Treasury, which owns 4.34% of Eni and controls another 25.76% via state lender CDP, has the right to appoint six members of Eni's nine-strong board. It is expected to present a list of candidates that will include the name of the new CEO.

The Treasury declined to comment for this story, as did Eni.

DON'T ROCK THE BOAT

Descalzi was first appointed to the top job at Eni in 2014 by the government of Matteo Renzi, whose Italy Alive party is now a junior member of the ruling coalition.

Helped by major discoveries in Egypt and Mozambique, Descalzi transformed the company into one of the industry's most successful oil and gas explorers. He has shunned costly bets on North American shale gas and more recently won accolades from investors by signing a flurry of deals in the Gulf.

However, his leadership has not been without controversy.

In one of the oil industry's biggest ever scandals, Italian prosecutors allege Eni and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) bought a Nigerian oilfield in 2011 knowing most of the $1.3 billion purchase price would go to agents and middlemen in bribes.

The trial, which includes Descalzi because he led Eni's exploration and production business at the time of the transaction, is drawing to a close, but is not expected to conclude until after the nomination process for a new CEO.

Eni and Shell, like Descalzi, have denied wrongdoing.

Despite the allegations, two of the sources said Rome was drawn to keeping Descalzi as a steady pair of hands at a time of increasing turmoil in Libya, where Eni is the biggest foreign oil and gas producer. ""The (Italian) government at the moment is weak and the message coming out of Rome is to rock the boat as little as possible,"" one of them said.

Descalzi's experience could also help Eni meet growing pressure from politicians and investors for oil companies to do more to address global warming.

The CEO, a physicist by training, set up Eni's green energy unit in 2015 and introduced a target for net-zero carbon emissions from exploration and production operations by 2030.

However, rivals such as Repsol (MC: ), Shell (L: ) and, more recently, BP (L: ), have gone further, and Descalzi is under pressure to set bolder targets.

Shell two weeks ago announced the suspension of LNG production due to the electrical trip.

""The shipping schedule has been proactively adjusted, with cargoes temporarily suspended,"" Shell said in its statement.

A Shell spokeswoman declined to comment on the likely timing for restoring production or how many cargoes might be affected.

Prelude, the world's largest floating LNG facility, shipped its first LNG cargo in June last year following start-up delays. It has been working to get to steady output at full capacity since then.

Prelude has the capacity to produce 3.6 million tonnes a year of LNG, 1.3 million tonnes a year of condensate and 400,000 tonnes a year of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

The outage comes at a time when the Asian LNG market has sunk to record low prices below $3 per million British thermal units as the coronavirus epidemic has dented gas demand in China, the world's second-largest importer of LNG.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-temporarily-suspends-lng-liftings-from-prelude-off-australia-2053704,0.036,0.927,0.037,0.1027

Investing.com -- Either the oil and gas sector is either on the verge of disaster, or a buying opportunity has opened up.

For obvious reasons, oil and gas-related stocks tend to track the price of , although the degree of correlation varies according to sector and to region. But the combination of coronavirus, trade wars, the OPEC-Russia alliance and Climate Change appear to have broken that link, at least in the short term.

The price for – which admittedly tends to be more volatile than aggregate share prices – has rebounded over 10% from its Feb. 10 bottom of $53.11 a barrel, but you really wouldn’t guess it from looking at the stock market.

Almost all of Europe’s majors – Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), BP (LON: ), Total (PA: ), ENI (MI: ) and Repsol (MC: ) – are trading below where they were on the day that troughed. Norway’s Equinor (OL: ) is the sole exception, and even that is only 2.2% above its low.

Why, when the oil market is doing its best to ‘look through’ the short-term impact of Covid-19, is the stock market failing to do the same?

It can be argued that OPEC’s inability to agree deeper production cuts with Russia has hit western majors particularly hard, given that the resulting ‘lower-for-longer’ crude scenario turns profitable projects into marginal ones and requires higher risk premiums from equity investors.

The coronavirus has also hit some harder than others. Shell (LON: ), for one, has suffered particularly badly from the disruption to the LNG market as Chinese buyers have invoked refused to take delivery of contracted cargoes, forcing the world’s most expensive gas to be dumped elsewhere in Asia at firesale prices.

Shell (LON: ) is the world’s largest LNG supplier and also the worst-performing of the majors this year, down 15%. Of the other big LNG players, Total is down 9.6%, Repsol (MC: ) 13% and Equinor 9.6%. Only BP (LON: ) has escaped relatively lightly with a 2.7% drop.

But neither OPEC nor coronavirus can explain why Shell (LON: ), Equinor, Eni and Total are all at or near their lowest in three-and-a-half years with no sign of a bounce in sight.

The explanation for that lies most likely in a long-term structural shift away from fossil fuel companies flagged last month by Blackrock’s Larry Fink in a letter that warned of a “fundamental reshaping of finance” to reflect concerns about Climate Change.

It’s no accident that low-carbon energy companies, which for years were also chained to oil prices because they were the marginal technology, have emphatically broken that link this year, at the same time as hydrocarbon giants have floundered.

Hydrocarbon producers may be due a bounce if crude prices can hold at their current level, which is still in the ball park of what they need to cover capex and dividends. The rich valuations of 'greener' stocks may even provide a nice arbitrage opportunity short-term. But Fink's warning will still be valid when the last coronavirus patient has recovered,",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-big-oil-looks-into-the-abyss-2056717,0.143,0.806,0.051,-0.9957

OSLO (Reuters) - Oil majors BP (L: ), Shell (LON: ) and Total (PA: ) want to connect some of their oil platforms to Norway's onshore power grid to reduce carbon emissions, BP said in a letter to the oil and energy ministry.

Pressure has intensified on fossil fuel companies to curb emissions as investors threaten to withhold funds and public awareness of climate change grows.

BP on Wednesday said it planned deep cuts to its emissions by 2050.

Offshore installations at BP's Eastern Trough Area Project (ETAP), Shell's Shearwater and Total's Elgin-Franklin in the British sector of the North Sea could be connected via a 300-kilometres-long subsea cable, BP's letter said.

""Electrification of these platforms offers significant socio-economic benefits by significantly reducing emissions,"" BP said in a letter to the ministry seen by Reuters.

It said it had already submitted an application to connect to the Norwegian grid, asking the ministry's officials to meet to discuss the project further.

Norway, which has generated huge wealth by exporting fossil fuel, generates its own electricity almost entirely from renewable sources, such as hydro and wind power.

A number of oil platforms on the Norwegian continental shelf have already been connected to the grid, with more projects expected.

But the requests to electrify foreign oil platforms, replacing fossil fuel energy with carbon-free power, are unprecedented, the ministry said, adding it had yet to make a decision.

""Applications to build interconnections to supply petroleum installations abroad are not something the energy authorities have considered or decided on yet,"" a ministry spokesman said in an email to Reuters.

The installations would require 100-200 megawatts (MW) in power capacity, which could be provided by a subsea cable starting from 2023, with investments estimated in a range of 7 billion to 9 billion crowns ($760-977 million), BP said.

Shell had no immediate comment and Total could not immediately be reached for comment.

BP Plc (LON: ) pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its oil and gas operations and production by 2050, as its new boss sets out his vision for the future.

London-based BP (LON: ) became the latest fossil fuel giant to set out an ambitious, yet rather distant, target for curbing emissions of planet-warming gases. The announcement from incoming Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney shows BP is responding to pressure from major investors and activists.

“The world’s carbon budget is finite and running out fast; we need a rapid transition to net zero,” Looney said in a statement on Wednesday. “This will certainly be a challenge, but also a tremendous opportunity. It is clear to me, and to our stakeholders, that for BP (LON: ) to play our part and serve our purpose, we have to change.”

While Looney struck a confident tone, he faces an enormous task. For BP (LON: ) to survive the energy transition in a world that’s gradually falling out of love with oil, it will need to make big investments in new sources of clean energy, ensure cash keeps flowing from its fossil fuel assets, while also funneling generous returns to investors.

It’s a balancing act that its closest peer Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc is already struggling to master.

In the early 2000s, the company re-branded itself as “Beyond Petroleum” under another visionary CEO, John Browne. But big investments in solar power largely failed. In one of his last interviews before leaving office, Looney’s predecessor Bob Dudley warned against Big Oil moving too fast on new technologies to counter climate change, because their failure could lead to financial ruin.

However, circumstances are changing. Becoming greener is no longer a choice for the world’s largest polluters.

The damaging effects of rising global temperatures are increasingly evident and established investors are starting to worry about the vulnerability of their investment portfolios to a climate crisis. It was among the most debated subjects in this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos. Last month, BlackRock Inc (NYSE: ). added its significant weight to a $41 trillion investor group that’s pressing the biggest emitters to change their ways.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/new-bp-ceo-sets-out-plan-to-eliminate-its-co2-emissions-by-2050-2050270,0.109,0.78,0.112,-0.1779

SEOUL (Reuters) - Oil prices rose for a second day on Wednesday amid preliminary signs that new coronavirus cases are slowing in China, easing concerns over the demand impact from the disease in the world's second-largest oil consumer.

Brent crude ( ) was up 73 cents, or 1.3%, at $54.75 per barrel at 0137 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) ( ) rose 46 cents, or 0.9%, to $50.39.

According to data through Monday, the growth rate of new coronavirus cases in China has slowed to the lowest since Jan. 31.

Bans on travel to and from China and on the movement of goods inside the country have cut fuel usage. The two biggest Chinese refiners have said they will reduce their processing by about 940,000 barrels per day (bpd) as a result of the consumption drop, or about 7% of their 2019 processing runs.

""Concern over weak demand in China is forcing many producers to look for alternatives,"" ANZ Research said in a note. ""Companies such as Vitol, Shell (LON: ) and Litasco have been preparing to hire supertankers to store crude that would be otherwise destined for China.""

China's senior medical advisor said on Tuesday the outbreak may be over by April.

The demand concerns from the outbreak pushed Brent and WTI to their lowest in 13 months on Monday. Both benchmarks are down more than 20% from highs reached in January.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Tuesday cut its global oil demand growth forecast for this year by 310,000 bpd as the virus outbreak crimps oil consumption in China, the world's second-largest economy.

On the supply side, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, recommended a further cut of 600,000 bpd last week to stem the oil price fall.

However, Russia has been hesitant to commit to the additional cut, while Saudi Arabia wanted global major oil producers to agree a quick oil supply cut.

U.S. crude inventories rose by 6 million barrels in the week to Feb. 7 to 438.9 million barrels, beating analysts' expectations for an increase of 3 million barrels, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed late on Tuesday. [API/S]

Investing.com -- The covid-19 virus continued its spread amidst confusion over China's statistics. The U.S. intensified the pressure on Huawei, and its potential 5G customers, by bringing racketeering charges against the telecoms company. The dollar hit its highest in over four months as the Fed trimmed its repo operations. Nvidia's blowout earnings are likely to support U.S. stocks at the opening - unless data on retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment dictate otherwise. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Valentine's Day, 2020.

1. Covid confusion: Singapore warns of recession, HK cases hit 56

Confusion reigned over the spread of the Covid-19 virus after Chinese authorities took over 100 presumed victims off the official death, saying it had double-counted. The overall death toll still rose by over 100 to 1,383, while officially confirmed cases in China rose by some 5,000 to over 64,000. That's a big drop from the 15,000 increase reported on Thursday, which was down to changes in China's methodology for classifying confirmed cases.

Also on Friday, China’s National Health Commission said 1,716 health workers had contracted the virus, and six of them had died – the first time it had broken out such numbers.

Hong Kong, which has now confirmed 56 cases, said tourist arrivals had fallen by over 50% in January. HSBC Holdings (LON: )and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) joined the list of companies sending workers home from their Singapore and Hong Kong offices in response to reports of infections. Singapore’s Prime Minister said the island state could face recession due to the virus. Pharma giant AstraZeneca (LON: ) warned of a possibly significant hit to its business this year from the virus.

2. U.S. charges Huawei with racketeering

The U.S. formally charged Huawei with racketeering, citing years of intellectual property theft.

The measures underline the U.S.’s continuing efforts to keep pressure on Beijing against the backdrop of ongoing trade tensions, and in particular its efforts to stop the spread of Huawei’s global presence in 5G networks.

The move comes only days after the U.S. charged four Chinese military personnel with theft in hacking the networks of credit reporting giant Equifax (NYSE: ).

3. King Dollar hits four-month high

The dollar hit its highest level since late September against its developed-market peers as the hit its lowest since 2017 on the back of weak growth numbers.

The euro zone’s grew by only 0.9% on the year in the fourth quarter, according to data from Eurostat that were revised down from original estimates. In quarterly terms, eked out 0.1% growth as , the region’s biggest economy, stagnated.

The hit an overnight high of 99.04, before retreating to 98.968 as of 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT). It’s risen 2% in the last month.

The greenback has also advanced against most emerging market currencies since the Covid-19 outbreak hit. Commodity currencies in particular have suffered – the , and losing between 3.2% and 4.2% over the last month. The exception has been the , which hit new highs overnight despite another 25 basis point rate cut from the central bank on Thursday.

A further factor strengthening the dollar was the Federal Reserve’s decision to scale down its daily and two-week repo operations a little ahead of schedule, tightening liquidity in U.S. funding markets.

4. Stocks set to shrug off virus concerns; Nvidia earnings blow past forecasts

U.S. stocks are set to open higher, shrugging off losses made late on Thursday, shrugging off the dollar’s rise, which may weigh on the earnings of multinationals and big exporters over the rest of the year.

By 6:40 AM ET, the contract was up 24 points or 0.1%, while the contract was up 0.1% and the was up 0.3%.

The Nasdaq in particular was supported by chipmaker , whose quarterly earnings handsomely beat expectations after the closing bell on Thursday, thanks to strong demand for its data center and gaming chips. Sales in the fourth quarter rose 41%, while adjusted earnings per share more than doubled. The company said it had reduced expectations for Chinese sales by $100 million in the current quarter, but its forecast for overall sales was still above consensus forecasts.

(Bloomberg) -- BP (LON: ) Plc’s pledge to zero out all its carbon emissions by 2050 deepens the divide between major European and American oil producers on climate change, increasing the pressure for Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ) to do more.

The U.S. supermajors have only committed to reducing greenhouse gases from their own operations, which typically account for just 10% of fossil fuel pollution. BP on Wednesday followed Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Equinor ASA in pledging to offset emissions from the fuels they sell to customers, representing about 90% of the total.

“If we do see capital flowing into BP, that may force the U.S. majors to rethink the speed at which they move on carbon reduction targets,” said Noah Barrett, a Denver-based energy analyst at Janus Henderson, which manages $356 billion. Still, he doesn’t see “Chevron or Exxon adopting a BP-like strategy in the near future” as they “have historically been less aggressive in their shift away from traditional oil and gas.”

Concerns about global warming are increasingly reshaping investment policies, with BlackRock Inc (NYSE: ). and State Street Corp (NYSE: ). becoming the latest high-profile investors to demand companies improve environmental, social and governance metrics, or ESG.

Exxon and Chevron, the West’s number one and three oil producers, say it’s not up to them to offset emissions from cars, factories and other polluters known in the industry as Scope 3. For Exxon, such emissions are the “result of choices consumers make.” Chevron says “well-designed policies and carbon pricing mechanisms” are needed.

But BP’s announcement “could be a real tipping point where the norm becomes taking responsibility” for customer emissions, said Kathy Mulvey, a campaign director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “For a company to continue to stick their heads in the sand and refuse to take responsibility for those harmful impacts is not a sustainable business model.”

Exxon and Chevron do agree with the goals of the Paris Agreement, support a carbon tax and are committed to cleaning up emissions from their vast network of wells, refineries and pipelines. They joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative later than their European rivals but are still fully paid up members. They even lobbied against U.S President Donald Trump’s plan to roll back Obama-era emission standards.

The fundamental difference with European peers, however, is that neither is reducing commitment to their oil and gas business by chasing the crowd into lower-margin renewables such as wind and solar.

When asked about potentially following Shell into the power sector, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth was clear in an interview with Bloomberg News last year.

“We don’t see distinctive differentiating capabilities that would say, ‘wow we can do this better,’” he said. “And it’s inherently lower return than the other things we could invest money in.”

Chevron is investing in early-stage technologies that could help aid carbon capture and energy storage, but that’s a small fraction of its budget. The company helps customers clean up their energy usage by supplying gas for power generation that’s cleaner than coal, developing biofuels and adding renewable energy sources like wind and geothermal, it said in a statement.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods says the real answer to climate change will come through technologies that haven’t yet been invented. The company said in a statement it has invested more than $10 billion over the past 20 years in researching and developing low emissions technologies.

The oil giant is working on proprietary technologies that would reduce emissions in areas like aviation, heavy duty vehicles and industrial processes. “We can bring more value in the space where we don’t know what the solution is but we need one,” Woods said in an April interview. Exxon has pedigree in this field. It invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s.

This approach will likely come under attack at this year’s round of shareholder meetings in May. Both companies are being asked by Dutch activist investor group Follow This to align their strategies with the Paris Agreement. Exxon is asking the Securities and Exchange Commission to exclude that proposal from a shareholder vote, arguing it “seeks to micromanage” the company.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/all-eyes-on-exxon-chevron-after-bp-pledges-to-be-carbon-neutral-2051036,0.035,0.879,0.086,0.99

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (LON: ) set one of the oil sector's most ambitious targets for curbing carbon emissions on Wednesday as new chief executive Bernard Looney began the biggest revamp in its 111-year history.

While investor groups welcomed the 2050 targets set out by Looney, which put BP ahead of rivals Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), Total, Equinor and all of the U.S. oil majors, environmental campaigners criticised a lack of detail.

""We have got to change and change profoundly because the world is changing fast and so are society's expectations of us,"" Looney said in his first major speech as CEO, after earlier highlighting a need to ""reinvent BP"".

""It is aiming to reduce and neutralise the carbon in the oil and gas that we dig out of the ground,"" Looney added.

BP did not say how it intends to get emissions from its operations and barrels produced to net zero and halve the intensity of emissions by all products it sells, including diesel and petrol, a measure known as Scope 3.

The company has tried, and failed, to reinvent itself before, with a pioneering plan to build a large renewables business in the early 2000s which ended with huge losses.

One possible way to hit greenhouse gas reduction targets is to buy offset certificates and bet on carbon capture and storage technology, which is not yet used on a commercial scale.

But Charlie Kronick, Oil Advisor from Greenpeace UK, was sceptical about how BP can deliver.

""How will they reach net zero ... When will they stop wasting billions on drilling for new oil and gas we can't burn?""

Shares in BP were up 1.3% at 1423 GMT, roughly in line with the broader European energy sector index after the news, which confirmed a Reuters report in January.

RAPID TRANSITION

The world's top oil and gas companies are under heavy pressure from investors and climate activists to meet the 2015 Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels.

U.S. groups such as Exxon (NYSE: ), Chevron (NYSE: ) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ) are far less ambitious with their greenhouse gas reduction targets than their European rivals.

Stephanie Pfeifer, a member of the global Climate Action 100+ Steering Committee and CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change welcomed BP's plan.

""Building on the positive engagement with BP ... investors will continue to look for progress from the company in addressing climate change. This includes how it will invest more in non-oil and gas businesses,"" she said in a statement.

BP's absolute net zero carbon target relates to every barrel it produces, based on its equity stake in oil and gas fields, from the well to the petrol station. It does not encompass oil products which BP markets, but does not produce itself.

BP, which produced around 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019, said it would cut emissions to net zero from some 415 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year.

Near term plans will be published by a September investor day, Looney said, adding BP is likely to produce fewer barrels by 2050.

""We welcome BP’s recognition of the reality we now live in but 2050 is too late,"" a spokeswoman for climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion said.

Anglo-Dutch group Shell has set Scope 3 targets based on intensity rather than on absolute reduction terms.

Intensity-based targets measure the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of energy or barrel of oil and gas produced. That means that absolute emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls.

Scope 3 emissions vastly exceed greenhouse gases caused by the production of , and refined products, including electricity generation, typically by a factor of about six among oil majors, according to Reuters calculations.

'NEW EXPECTATIONS'

BP will also set ""new expectations"" for relationships with trade organisations and be ready to quit if they are not aligned.

Last year, BP invested around $500 million in low-carbon technologies including wind power, electric vehicle battery charging systems and solar power firm Lightsource BP. That compared to an overall budget of $15.2 billion in 2019.

In perhaps its biggest-ever corporate shake-up, BP will dismantle the traditional model of an oil and gas production, or upstream, unit and a refining, trading and marketing, or downstream, unit to ""become more integrated and more focused"".

A new production and operations unit, which includes oil and gas production as well as refining and chemicals, will be led by Gordon Birrell. Meanwhile, customers and products will be led by Emma Delaney, gas and low carbon energy by Dev Sanyal and innovation and engineering by David Eyton.

(Reuters) - London's blue-chip index fell on Thursday after two successive days of gains, dragged down by exporters which were hurt by a stronger pound as investors positioned for a higher-spending budget next month under a new British finance minister.

The FTSE 100 ( ) ended the session 1.1% lower, derailed by steep falls in heavyweights Barclays (L: ) and Centrica (L: ), while a rise in new coronavirus cases in China jolted broader risk sentiment.

British utility Centrica skidded 15.3% after its 2019 profit slumped by more than a third, while Barclays slipped 1.7% as news Britain's financial regulators were probing historical links between the bank's chief executive officer and U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein overshadowed financial results.

The mid-cap FSTE 250 ( ) lost 0.6%, tracking a broader risk-off sentiment as the Chinese province of Hubei, an epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, reported a record rise in deaths and thousands of more cases.

The increase in numbers, which came after China introduced a new diagnostic procedure involving quicker computerised tomography (CT) scans to screen patients, dented hopes that the outbreak would soon plateau.

After the initial outbreak roiled global markets last month, investors have become more sensitive to the rate of escalation.

""China is the world’s largest importer of oil so the renewed fears about the health crisis have hit stocks like BP and Royal Dutch Shell,"" CMC Markets analyst David Madden said, adding that mining stocks such as BHP (L: ), Rio Tinto (L: ) and Anglo American (L: ) were hurt too.

""It has been a double whammy for the FTSE 100 as the drive higher in sterling has dented internationally focused stocks like GlaxoSmithKline (L: ) and AstraZeneca (L: ), plus Unilever (L: ),"" he said.

The midcap index was also dragged down by British gambling firms William Hill (L: ), GVC (L: ), Playtech (L: ) and 888 (L: ) following a media report that the gambling commission would consider putting limits on the amount consumers are allowed to bet online.

All sectors of the FTSE 100 ended lower, with oil majors Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) among the major drags, followed by financials. The index substantially underperformed the broader European benchmark ( ) as more of its components are exposed to commodity prices.

UAE-based NMC Health (L: ), whose shares have swung sharply in recent sessions amid takeover chatter, tumbled 4.2% after analysts at SocGen slapped a double rating downgrade on the stock.

(Bloomberg) -- HSBC Holdings PLC (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell PLC (AS: ) are sending staff home in Hong Kong and Singapore after contact with people infected by the coronavirus, adding to concerns the disease will spread more broadly across the two Asian financial hubs.

HSBC, which employs 21,000 people in Hong Kong, on Friday revealed one of its employees has been placed under government quarantine after “close contact” with relatives diagnosed with the coronavirus. The bank is contacting staff who may have recently come in close contact with the individual, and will advise them to observe 14-day self-care at home, according to a memo sent to staff, which was confirmed by a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman.

“All employees have been reminded to be mindful of hygiene procedures and to stay at home or see a doctor if they feel unwell in any way,” the spokeswoman said. “HSBC will continue to closely monitor the development of the case and stay in close contact with health authorities.”

Oil giant Shell sent some staff from its trading desks in Singapore home after an employee was found to have had contact with a coronavirus case, according to people familiar with the matter. Part of the company’s trading desks were already working remotely as part of a contingency plan, but now all will need to work from home.

Companies in Hong Kong and Singapore have begun taking heightened cautionary measures from closing bank branches, to temperature checks and to having employees work from home or alternative sites as well as self-quarantining to protect staff. Recessions are now threatening the two financial hubs, which have seen the largest number of confirmed cases outside China, excluding an outbreak on a cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama, Japan.

The virus has so far killed more than 1,300 people, mainly in mainland China. Hong Kong has reported one death and 53 confirmed cases. Singapore has 58 confirmed cases.

The HSBC employee has been under self-care since Wednesday after appearing at the bank’s main office in central Hong Kong for three days from the end of January. The person also visited another office in Tseung Kwan O, an area in eastern Hong Kong, earlier this month and took a shuttle bus from Taikoo to Tseung Kwan O.

In an emailed statement, Shell confirmed that an employee had close contact with a coronavirus case. As a precautionary measure, the firm advised colleagues that had close contact with the employee to work from home with immediate effect until further notice, according to the statement.

Shell said its operations aren’t impacted by the development.

Other companies in Singapore’s business district have confirmed at least three infections, one of which caused DBS Group Holdings Ltd. to ask staff on Level 43 of its Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3 headquarters to work from home.

Recession could be a possibility in Singapore as the country battles the coronavirus outbreak, the Straits Times reported, citing comments from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

MUFG Employee

Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (T: ) also quarantined an employee at home in Hong Kong after a family member was suspected of being infected, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The employee, who works at the Quarry Bay office, is not infected. As a precautionary measure, other colleagues in the same office were also quarantined until further notice, according to a memo seen by Bloomberg.

Along with other banks, HSBC is rolling out relief measures to help Hong Kongers cope with the virus outbreak that is weighing on the city’s retail and tourism industries.

(Reuters) - UK shares advanced on Wednesday, helped by gains in heavyweight oil firms and on relief that the number of new cases of coronavirus infections out of China was falling.

China reported its lowest number of new coronavirus cases since late January, bolstering a forecast by Beijing's senior medical adviser for the outbreak in the country to end by April even though fears of further international spread remained.

That helped the FTSE 100 ( ) add 0.50%, with an additional boost to the blue-chip index from oil majors Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ), as they tracked a surge in crude prices.

Miner Anglo American (L: ) rose 4.9% as UBS raised its rating on the stock.

The FTSE 250 ( ) added 0.68%, led by payments company Finablr (L: ). Home furnishings retailer Dunelm (L: ) which jumped 8.7% after an upbeat profit forecast.

Online trading platform Plus500 (L: ) also supported the mid-cap index with a 4.6% rise as its second-half core earnings nearly doubled from the first.

Slightly more than 2,000 new confirmed cases took China's coronavirus total to 44,653. That was the lowest daily rise since Jan. 30 and soothed public fears and markets on hopes of an end to disruption in the world's second-largest economy.

""While there continues to be high uncertainty about the rate of spread and timing of the peak of the coronavirus, modelling by epidemiological experts indicates a likely range for the peak between late February and June,"" analysts at S&P Global said.

CMC Markets analyst David Madden said the impression is the Chinese government are more in control of the crisis, and that has boosted sentiment, with the FTSE at its highest level since late January.

Dealers also took note of comments overnight from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who remained fairly upbeat about the U.S. economy, but warned that the virus-led disruptions in China could spill over globally.

""One can, in fact, make a bullish case for equities based on any scenario regarding COVID-19,"" OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said.

(Bloomberg) -- Global commodity trade plunged deeper into chaos as Chinese companies started walking away from purchase contracts because of the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

A Chinese buyer of liquefied and a importer declared what’s known as force majeure -- meaning they are reneging on deals as the virus constrains their ability to take deliveries. The cancellations are among the first known cases of the legal clause being invoked in commodity contracts due to the epidemic.

“Everything that we were afraid of, from trade wars or global growth, doesn’t compare,” said Jan Stuart, global energy economist at Cornerstone Macro. “This virus is an entirely different risk, especially in commodities where China’s role dominates.”

China is the world’s biggest consumer of most raw materials, from energy products to industrial metals, and disruptions in its purchases create havoc across global supply chains. Now, while global markets bounce back from initial fears over the impact of the virus, the fallout in commodity trade is only worsening as Beijing keeps swathes of the country under lockdown and restricts travel.

When God Appears in Contracts, That’s ‘Force Majeure’: QuickTake

In a dramatic and rare step, China National Offshore Oil Corp., the nation’s biggest LNG buyer, invoked force majeure and told some suppliers it won’t take delivery of cargoes because of constraints caused by the coronavirus. French oil and gas giant Total SA (PA: ) rejected the declaration.

Hours later, it emerged that Chinese copper smelter Guangxi Nanguo had also declared the same get-out clause, refusing to take delivery of raw materials.

Meanwhile, copper buyers are requesting Chilean miners postpone shipments because of port shutdowns while China’s biggest oil refiner, Sinopec Group, is likely to ask Saudi Arabia to reduce crude supplies next month. Soybeans from Brazil and the U.S. are being held up on arrival in eastern China and Indonesian palm oil shipments are also being delayed.

“We are truly concerned about the loss of buying power that has spread across every division of commodities,” said Pete Thomas, a senior vice president at Chicago-based broker Zaner Group. “The impact has been much larger than everyone even realizes it would be.”

For LNG, CNOOC’s force majeure hurts a market already buffeted by rising U.S. supplies and weak demand after a mild winter in Europe and Asia. Even before Chinese buyers walked away from supply contracts, spot prices fell to a record low, crippling the profitability of energy giants like Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ).

CNOOC sent the force majeure notice to suppliers including Shell and Total, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Shell declined to comment.

Total confirmed it received one force majeure notification, which it rejected after legal analysis, Philippe Sauquet, the company’s president for gas, renewables and power, said in a company presentation.

“Of course we have to be careful, if there is a real quarantine in all unloading ports in China, we have a real case for force majeure,” he said. “But for the time being, this is not the case. For me it is ordinary negotiation.”

Amid low prices and demand, there is “a strong temptation from some long-term customers to try to play with force majeure and say I cannot take my cargo under long-term contract,” he said.

Japan Korea Marker, the spot Asian LNG benchmark, fell to record low $3 per million British thermal units, according to S&P Global Platts.

China said last week that it would offer support to companies seeking to declare force majeure on international contracts.

(Bloomberg) -- China’s biggest buyer of liquefied told some suppliers it won’t take delivery of cargoes because of constraints caused by the coronavirus, a rare step that shows how deeply the epidemic is impacting global commodity flows.

China National Offshore Oil Corp. has declared force majeure on some contracts, according to people with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be identified as the information isn’t public. Nobody answered several calls to the company, known as CNOOC, and its listed unit Cnooc Ltd. didn’t respond to a request for comment.

It’s among the first cases of a force majeure clause being invoked in the global commodity market as a result of the coronavirus after speculation mounted that Chinese buyers of everything from to LNG could be forced to take the dramatic step. It’s a sign of the deepening disruptions to flows of key raw materials as the virus curbs demand and constrains logistics.

CNOOC sent the force majeure notice to firms including Royal Dutch Shell PLC (AS: ) and Total SA (PA: ), according to the people, who said it covers prompt shipments.

China said last week that it would offer support to its companies that are seeking to declare force majeure on international contracts, referring to the situation when a company is unable to meet contractual obligations for reasons beyond its control.

Suppliers to CNOOC include the Woodside Petroleum Ltd.-operated North West Shelf LNG and Shell’s Queensland Curtis LNG projects, as well as Total, according to S&P Global Platts, which reported the force majeure earlier. Shell declined to comment. Woodside said it’s “closely monitoring for potential impacts on the market.” Total didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The move will add further pressure on spot LNG prices in Asia, which are already trading at the lowest on record amid a supply glut and milder winter temperatures.

Elsewhere in China, the country’s largest oil and gas firm, PetroChina Co., was forced to delay discharge timings for multiple cargoes because it can’t get enough workers to its Rudong, Dalian and Caofeidian LNG terminals to run them at full capacity.

(Bloomberg) -- Oil prices bounced back from the lowest in more than a year on Tuesday but the emergence of a glut since the coronavirus outbreak loomed over the market as traders look to store excess crude on tankers.

The world’s largest oil traders are seeking to hoard crude on vessels at sea as the industry tries to deal with the oversupply that’s developed as the outbreak wreaked havoc on Asia’s largest economy. Chinese energy importers are struggling to cope with swelling stockpiles, with one declaring force majeure, as travel bans and quarantines weigh on fuel demand.

The growing glut and dithering by OPEC and its allies over whether to hold an emergency meeting in response have pushed the oil market into a structure known as contango, where near-term prices trade at a discount to future contracts. And, while oil rebounded somewhat on Tuesday amid a broader move up in financial markets, the contango for remained at the widest in four months.

“Crude remains under pressure from worries over demand destruction from the coronavirus,” said Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights. “Prices are likely to continue drifting lower in tandem with the progression of the epidemic.”

West Texas Intermediate crude for March rose 1.1% to $50.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 10:59 a.m. Singapore time. It fell 1.5% on Monday. for April climbed 1.3% to $53.96 a barrel on the London-based ICE (NYSE: ) Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a $3.65 premium to WTI for the same month.

Vitol SA, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Litasco SA are among firms asking about hiring supertankers for storage purposes as a sharp drop in Chinese demand due to the coronavirus prompts requests for cargo deferments, according to people familiar with the matter, shipbrokers and oil traders.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is unlikely to meet in February to discuss the effect of the virus on oil markets, leaving the possibility of further production cuts up in the air. Technical experts had earlier recommended a further supply cut of 600,000 barrels a day until June, said OPEC delegates, who asked not to be named because talks were private.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/oil-bounces-from-oneyear-low-but-emergence-of-glut-looms-2049084,0.152,0.83,0.018,-0.9959

(Bloomberg) -- Oil prices indicated that global markets face a renewed surplus as Asia’s coronavirus hits demand, with discounts on prompt supplies emerging across the Brent futures curve.

has moved into a full “contango” structure in which each monthly contract is cheaper than the next, suggesting a glut in supply. Global demand estimates are being cut as the outbreak causes severe economic disruption in China, while OPEC is hesitating over steps to support prices.

As the glut begins to accumulate, leading oil traders such as Vitoil SA, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Litasco SA are seeking to hoard crude on vessels at sea. One Chinese energy company has invoked a legal clause to avoid taking delivery of liquefied .

“When the oil market is in surplus -- as it is now -- the forward curve needs to be in contango in order to pay for the storage of the building surplus,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at Swedish bank SEB AB. It’s the first time a full contango has taken hold in a year, he said.

for April settlement rose 1.3% to $53.96 a barrel on the ICE (NYSE: ) Futures Europe exchange in London as of 10:31 a.m. London time, supported by a recovery in equity markets. The U.S. benchmark, , was at $50.20 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The North Sea crude market, priced using Brent, suffered an “immediate collapse” when shipments to Asia were disrupted, said Olivier Jakob, managing director at consultant Petromatrix GmbH. With Europe also receiving shipments from the U.S., “a surplus can quickly be created.”

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners have fanned speculation over the past two weeks that they might take action to arrest the slump in prices. A committee of their technical experts recommended last week that the coalition should deepen current supply curbs by a further 600,000 barrels a day to drain the excess created by the virus.

Yet the latest signals from the group have deflated those hopes. Azerbaijan’s Energy Minister said on Monday that the alliance probably wouldn’t meet before it’s scheduled March meeting. And days after promising to announce Russia’s position, Energy Minister Alexander Novak would only say on Tuesday that Moscow is considering the proposal.

(Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), which plans billions of dollars in spending on shale drilling projects, boosted output in the top U.S. shale field to 250,000 barrels per day in December, the company's Permian Basin head said on Wednesday.

Shell plans to spend about $3 billion (2.3 billion pounds) per year for the next five years on shale projects, said Amir Gerges, vice president of Permian assets for Shell, at the Argus Americas Crude Summit in Houston. Its Permian Basin production rose more than 100,000 barrels per day in the last year.

“We continue to ramp up our production from our core acreage,” Gerges said.

Shell and rival oil majors Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), Chevron (NYSE: ) and BP (LON: ) are spending billions in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. The companies see shale as a short-cycle asset that complements projects such as deepwater wells that take years to bring into production.

The Permian has 30 years of so-called “tier one” high quality drilling inventory and will remain at the heart of U.S. oil growth, Gerges said. But the industry faces challenges in the region, ranging from too much flaring to inadequate infrastructure and ""even today’s investor sentiments,"" he said.

Previously, Shell indicated it might seek a way to expand its presence in the Permian, but during last week's earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden indicated the timing is not right for an acquisition.

""I think anything inorganic would not be the right thing to do,"" van Beurden said.

Oil and gas companies of all sizes have been under pressure to produce more free cash and return it to investors through share buybacks and dividends.

The industry also faces pressures to reduce emissions, especially from prolific gas flaring, deliberately burning gas produced as a byproduct to oil. The practice can worsen climate change by releasing carbon dioxide.

The U.S. drilling industry flared or vented more natural gas in 2019 for the third year in a row, as soaring production in Texas, New Mexico, and North Dakota have overwhelmed regulatory efforts to curb the practice, according to state data and independent research estimates.

“The flaring and emissions in the Permian Basin have become famous and it’s not something we would like to be recognised for,” Gerges said.

The region needs more infrastructure such as natural gas pipelines, but it is more important to have ""robust, fit-for-purpose policies and regulatory requirements that incentivize reduction in flaring,"" Gerges said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/shell-boosts-crude-output-in-top-us-shale-field-to-250000-bpd-2045996,0.034,0.891,0.076,0.9338

ABERDEEN, Scotland (Reuters) - It is up to governments to drive decarbonisation and consumers will have to pay more to achieve carbon neutrality, Total's (PA: ) chief executive said, adding the French firm has no intention of moving away from oil and gas production.

Oil firms should not be seen as ""villains"" amid growing pressure from investors and climate activists, chief executive and chairman Patrick Pouyanne told Reuters at Total's headquarters in the Scottish oil hub of Aberdeen.

Giving up on oil and gas would be ""a huge mistake"", partly because it pays for investment in green technology, he said, echoing Shell (L: ) CEO Ben van Beurden who told Reuters last year that it had no choice but to invest in oil and gas..

""Suppose we announced today that we have stopped producing oil, do you think cars will suddenly be driven without gasoline? No, it doesn't work. It is not black and white,"" he added.

""We don't want to go away from oil and gas. We have all the financial capacities to be in the driving seat (of the energy transition) and not to be the villains of the story,"" he said.

Since Pouyanne, 56, became CEO in 2014 after his predecessor Christophe de Margerie died in a plane crash, Total has introduced targets to cut carbon emissions, although critics say it is still not aligned with the United Nations-backed 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming.

""Society wants to be carbon neutral, but the energy companies will not be carbon neutral,"" Pouyanne

""Maybe it will take 20 years. It will take time, and this will have an impact on demand, so we need to position the company to be ready,"" Pouyanne said.

Pouyanne said Total will choose at some point whether to abandon oil and gas, but for now fossil fuel profits remain the engine of its growth in renewable and low-carbon energy.

Revenue from its largest segment is needed to grow in power markets, electric vehicle charging technologies and biofuels which are less profitable, and in some cases, loss-making.

But as Total's new low-carbon businesses become larger and more profitable, that could change.

""At a certain point, we'll probably have to choose; do we insist more on this one or this one. Today we have the financial capacity to look at various axis.""

Total, which has rebranded itself in recent years as an energy rather than oil and gas company, is targeting a near ten-fold expansion in renewable power generation by 2025, but Pouyanne said this will not come cheap.

""Maybe society wants oil to be green, but to be green that means we are ready to pay for it,"" he said.

For example, if European governments decided that all domestic flights should have around 2% of biofuels in the jet fuel, it could increase costs for an average French airline company by around 100 million euros (84 million pounds) a year, which would be passed on to passengers, Pouyanne calculated.

Total and rival energy companies had been used as ""scapegoats"", Pouyanne said, adding that the debate should be about demand not supply.

""Today, car engines consume oil. If tomorrow car manufacturers decide that most of the cars are electric-driven, the demand will just disappear,"" he added

Pouyanne said that while oil and gas account for most of its operations, 50% of Total's activities will focus on gas by 2040, 30% on oil and biofuels and 20% on electricity.

Total's oil and gas production grew 9% last year when net profits reached almost $12 billion, allowing it to boost dividends.

And although only 10% of its $17.4 billion investments in 2019 went into renewables, Total has expanded further in recent weeks with projects in Qatar, India and Spain.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/total-ceo-says-governments-not-oil-firms-must-drive-carbon-curbs-2049729,0.057,0.854,0.088,0.971

(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here.

A grim situation for U.S. exporters has gotten even worse as the coronavirus outbreak sends global prices plunging on concern that China’s demand for the fuel will collapse.

Suppliers of American liquefied natural gas were already under pressure from depressed prices arising from a global glut and an unusually mild domestic winter. Now, with the virus threatening to disrupt industrial production across China, Asian spot LNG prices have hit a record low.

Faced with prospect of being unable to even cover their shipping costs, customers such as commodity trading houses may simply refuse to load U.S. cargoes. Those cancellations could force LNG export terminal operators to cap, or “shut in,” production of the fuel as their storage tanks fill up.

“Forward prices for summer are now at levels where U.S. LNG shut-ins begin to seem viable,” said Edmund Siau, a Singapore-based analyst with energy consultant FGE. “There is usually a lead time before a cargo can be canceled, and we expect actual supply curtailments to start happening in summer.”

Such an outcome would be a blow to the young and fast-expanding U.S. LNG industry. New export terminals from Maryland to Texas have sprung up to make the country one of the world’s top suppliers, while also providing a crucial outlet for soaring production from shale basins.

China hasn’t directly imported LNG from the U.S. in a year amid trade tensions and tariffs on the fuel. But it’s the world’s fastest-growing buyer, and a slowdown or decline in demand there will have an effect that ripples right across the market. China’s big state-owned LNG importers are said to be considering force majeure declarations on contracted cargo deliveries, which would further burden an oversupplied market.

Gas stockpiles in China are already brimming after a mild winter, increasing the risk that the world’s second-biggest economy will curb imports, said Nina Fahy, head of North American natural gas for Energy Aspects Ltd. in New York.

“The full impact of the coronavirus on global gas markets is yet to be felt as lower LNG demand expectations for the Lunar New Year were already built into most forecasts,” Madeline Jowdy, senior director of global gas and LNG for S&P Global Platts in New York, wrote in an email.“The global LNG outlook is going from bad to worse for suppliers.”

For Cheniere Energy Inc., the biggest U.S. exporter of the fuel, “the summer doesn’t look good” for the economics of American cargoes at the moment, Eric Bensaude, managing director of the company’s marketing arm in London, said in an interview. Any decisions by Cheniere’s buyers, which include Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Korea Gas Corp., are likely in March or April. While U.S. exporters’ customers have to pay a fee to reserve LNG under long-term contracts, they can opt out of buying with 30 to 60 days’ notice.

If a customer decides not to load a cargo, Cheniere’s marketing arm won’t take the LNG back and resell it unless market conditions have changed, Bensaude said. Instead, the company would typically reduce LNG production at its terminals, he said.

But U.S. LNG companies continue to sound an upbeat note on the longer-term outlook for the market. Charif Souki, co-founder of terminal developer Tellurian Inc, said the global glut of the fuel could be erased as soon as a year from now. Cheniere’s Bensaude said he also expects the oversupply to ease.

“We are going to weather the storm this year as the market should absorb production from the extra capacity that comes online,” Bensaude said.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's Ecopetrol (CN: ) and Anglo-Dutch energy giant Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) have teamed up to develop three blocks in the Caribbean, the state-owned oil company said on Friday.

Under the deal, Shell will acquire a 50% operating-stake in the Fuerte Sur, Purple Angel and COL-5 blocks, which are found in deep-water areas of the Colombian Caribbean.

Oil companies are expected to spend between $920 million and $1 billion on exploration efforts in Colombia this year, according to the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP).

Around $250 million to $260 million will go to offshore projects.

Ecopetrol Chief Executive Felipe Bayon said Shell's deep-water experience will prove useful in verifying the production capacity of the reservoirs and their potential for future development.

""We are very happy with this alliance, which will help use to grow reserves and production,"" Bayon said in a statement.

The blocks cover a recent gas discovery and the two companies intend to drill a new appraisal well near the end of 2021, Ecopetrol said. No value for the deal was given.

(Reuters) - Britain's Compass Group (L: ) said on Thursday first-quarter revenue rose as new business in North America cushioned the blow of slower demand for its catering services in Europe.

Shares of the caterer were up about 3% in early trading, tracking its best day in over six months.

Compass, which provides 5.5 billion meals for office workers, armed forces and school children in more than 50 countries, said its first-quarter organic revenue grew 5.3% year-on-year.

The company, which counts Alphabet Inc's (O: ) Google, Coca-Cola (N: ), Shell (AS: ) and Nike Inc (N: ) among its customers, maintained its 2020 forecast of organic growth in the range of 4%-6%.

""In the longer-term, we remain excited about the significant structural growth opportunities globally, and the potential for further revenue and profit growth combined with returns to shareholders,"" the company added.

The company said its cost-cutting plan, announced late last year, is progressing as expected and the benefits are offsetting slower demand in Europe.

The company had warned of hundreds of job cuts as a part of the programme in November to stem costs.

In the past, the British caterer had also cut food, labour and overhead expenses, and raised prices of their meals to boost profit, while operating margins took a hit from lower volumes and higher costs at its UK business.

In North America - the catering giant's biggest market - revenue rose 7.5% in the quarter.

Compass said that it recently sold half of its Japanese Highways business for 55 million pounds ($71.45 million), as a part of its disposal programme.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/uk-caterer-compass-firstquarter-organic-revenue-rises-2046202,0.034,0.86,0.105,0.9745

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Netherlands' biggest pension fund, ABP, said on Monday it aims to reduce the carbon footprint of its asset portfolio by 40% from 2015 levels by 2025.

ABP, which already set a target to cut the carbon footprint of its assets by 25% from 2015 levels by this year, follows moves by other leading funds - notably Norway's $1.1 trillion sovereign wealth fund - to divest heavy polluting energy companies from its portfolio.

ABP manages 465 billion euros (393.10 billion pounds) in assets for civil servants. Under its new target, it said it aims to invest $5 billion in ""sustainable and affordable energy"" companies over the next five years, adding to $10 billion already invested in such companies.

It plans to exit coal and tar sands investments, with some exceptions, by 2030, it said.

Peter Branner, chief investment officer at APG, the fund's pension manager, puts companies into three ethical categories: those that it excludes completely from its portfolio - such as nuclear weapons makers and tobacco companies; those that make a positive contribution to society, which it seeks to own more of; and a third category he termed ""laggards"" that have room to improve and which include the Netherlands' biggest company Royal Dutch Shell (L: ).

ABP tries to ""engage"" with these laggards, he said.

Shell is ABP's 70th largest investment, with holdings worth 582 million euros.

""It goes without saying that these (fossil fuel) companies and Shell in particular struggle,"" he said.

""When we talk about engagement with Shell of course it is no longer us that needs to convince oil companies about the importance of changing: they want to survive, right?""

SINGAPORE/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) said on Tuesday it has temporarily suspended production at its Prelude floating liquefied (LNG) facility off northwest Australia following an electrical trip on Feb. 2.

Work is under way to restore full operations, a spokeswoman told Reuters on Tuesday.

""Due to some technical issues, there was a delay in starting up the back-up diesel generators which impacted certain amenities on board. These issues are being resolved, and we have made the proactive decision to temporarily reduce the number of people on board,"" she said.

With Asian spot LNG prices diving to a record low this week as the coronavirus epidemic sweeping China dents demand from the world's second-largest importer of LNG, the impact of the production cut at Prelude is expected to be minimal, trade sources said. [LNG/]

""There is still too much gas and very little demand,"" a Singapore-based industry source said.

Buyers of LNG in China are bracing for gas demand to be shattered by a virus epidemic that has killed more than 420 people. Many buyers are considering either delaying cargoes or cancelling them by invoking a force majeure clause.

China is Australia's No.2 LNG export destination by volume, behind Japan.

Prelude, the world's largest floating LNG facility, has the capacity to produce 3.6 million tonnes a year of LNG, 1.3 million tonnes a year of condensate and 400,000 tonnes a year of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). It shipped its first LNG cargo in June last year following start-up delays.

(Bloomberg) -- An interconnected global economy is feeling the strain of China’s viral outbreak -- and the potential $160 billion hit in lost growth that may be on the way.

In New Zealand, a bath furnishings seller told a customer that the German-designed shower head he ordered is unavailable -- because the factory in Shanghai is closed. Out in California executives of REC Group organized a supply chain war room to plan around an anticipated trucking shortage and port logjam in China. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia is rallying support for an emergency OPEC meeting on concern oil demand will falter.

Since China’s last health crisis, the SARS outbreak of 2003, its share of global economic output has quadrupled to about 17%. It’s now the biggest market for new cars and semiconductors, the largest spender on international tourism, the leading exporter of clothing and textiles, and the land where many PCs and virtually all iPhones are made. The global hit from this new outbreak could be three to four times larger than the $40 billion blow from SARS, estimates Warwick McKibbin, a professor of economics at Australian National University.

Thus far, China has absorbed most of the economic shock from the coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV, which has killed more than 210 within its borders and infected over 9,950 globally. Wuhan, the city with 11 million residents where the virus came to light, remains closed off from the world. Under a government-mandated extension of the Lunar New Year holiday, provinces generating at least two-thirds of economic output will be shuttered through next week, including Shanghai and key eastern manufacturing hubs.

All the while, the virus’s toll continues to rise -- and with it the worry. China’s essential role in the global supply chain means business owners and executives around the world are being forced to contemplate what will happen in a prolonged crisis.

“Everyone is waiting to see how this evolves,” said Miguel Patricio, the chief executive officer of Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: ) Co. The food giant has a couple thousand employees in China, including a small sales team in Wuhan. “The danger, of course, is that if this continues and people have to stay home, you start having problems in terms of distribution, production.”

Closed Doors

Four months ago, Levi Strauss (NYSE: ) & Co. opened the doors to a flashy new flagship store in Wuhan, a booming manufacturing powerhouse that alternately gets called the Chicago or Detroit of China. The location features three levels of premium collections and a massive tailor shop. At just over 7,500 square feet (697 square meters), the location is twice as big as any other Levi franchises in China. The mega-store was heralded by top executives as a symbol of a new era of growth for the brand in the country.

Today, like almost everything else in town, the store is shut. A major component of Levi’s growth strategy in the region is temporarily stalled, joining thousands of international corporations, Chinese conglomerates and small businesses in the first wave of economic impact from the virus.

“Our priority is employees, and if the situation doesn’t correct itself quickly, we will probably remain closed for a while.” Levi Chief Financial Officer Harmit J Singh said in a phone interview.

International companies have poured into China, opening up Estée Lauder counters, Canada Goose stores and Rolls-Royce (LON: ) showrooms in Beijing and Shanghai. In more recent years, they moved into the second- and third-tier cities whose populations have ballooned during the nation’s mass urbanization.

Companies with big exposure to China, from Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ: ). to Tesla Inc., refrained from predicting this week how the virus would affect demand, saying simply that they’d update their forecasts when they know more. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). gave wider-than-usual forecast ranges for the quarter amid uncertainty about the virus impact.

The hope, of course, is that health officials are able to contain the spread of the virus enough to let people get back to the normal rhythms of life in a matter of weeks. A vaccine could be months or even years away, but some viruses can burn themselves out within the season. Others take longer. SARS was declared a global health emergency in March 2003 and was considered contained by that July.

The fear is that because 2019-nCoV has a stealthy quality -- symptoms can appear as late as two weeks after infection -- it will have staying power. Worst case, it could frustrate the best efforts of the world’s public health authorities and wreak havoc along trade routes and in boardrooms for months to come.

The first wave of economic impact from the virus comes at a delicate moment. Western companies have helped convert late January’s Lunar New Year festivities into a shopping bonanza, to the point where it’s become a key period for economic growth in China. This year, it’s been so subdued that consumption growth in the first quarter will slow by more than half in China from the 5.5% growth rate recorded in the final months of 2019, according to Bloomberg Economics.

It’s easy to see how. Starbucks has closed more than 2,000 outlets across China -- half of its total -- and can’t get some menu items for those that remain open. McDonald’s Corp. has shut hundreds of restaurants. Some Walmart (NYSE: ) Inc. stores are running out of products. Walt Disney (NYSE: ) Co.’s theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have gone dark. Even before the U.S. and Japan advised their citizens to avoid traveling to China, airlines had curtailed flights to the country -- not because of fear of contagion, but due to lack of passengers.

Many of those coffee purchases, vacation getaways and impulse buys are lost forever, in terms of GDP -- it’s not as if consumers will buy two lattes in March to make up for the one they meant to purchase in January. Manufacturing is different. Although factories that were supposed to be reopening now will remain closed, many have some wiggle room to make up for lost time, pay employees some overtime and finish off their orders.

But with every passing day, there’s less room to maneuver. Construction activity that was paused over the winter, especially in the colder northern parts of China, should be starting up by now. Capital spending is likely to be reined in as companies delay decisions until they know more about the virus’s impact.

The many companies that rely on Chinese manufacturing need to place orders soon to have products ready for peak shopping times.

Take Anne Harper, founder of OMG Accessories, a New York-based company that sells bags and backpacks to Macy’s Inc., Nordstrom Inc (NYSE: )., Dillard’s Inc., TJ Maxx and Burlington Stores Inc. Even before the Lunar New Year, she works to lock in orders with her supplier near Guangzhou to ensure she gets priority after the holiday. Customers want the product by May or June for back-to-school season, when some customers will sell 80,000 backpacks in a single week. That means OMG tries to fill its warehouse by April.

“Making those deliveries is just so important for the life cycle of our product,” Harper said. “If you miss delivery, everyone has already bought their school bags.”

The outbreak will also have a wide-ranging impact on the technology industry, with China accounting for about 21% of global IT hardware spending, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote Jan. 29. Some of the biggest PC makers and parts suppliers are based in China, and if there’s a slowdown in sales, that would constrain demand for Microsoft’s Windows operating system software.

Apple, Tech

More than 50% of the more than $470 billion of chips that are sold each year are either used in devices sold in China or go there to be put into gear sold around the world.

Apple has roughly 10,000 direct employees in China, and its supply chain has a few million workers manufacturing products like the iPad, iPhone and Apple Watch. The Cupertino, California-based company prepares for extreme scenarios like the coronavirus by mandating that major components be dual-sourced -- both in terms of vendors and geography -- and a major immediate impact to its production plans is unlikely for now, a person familiar with its operations said this week. Even so, most of its assembly work is done in China, and so a shortage of workers for assembly lines will have a direct impact on shipment numbers.

On the other side of the equation are small manufacturers in China whose livelihood depends on the confidence of their customers. Any hesitance from clients can cause disarray for people like Cash Liu, a sales director at hot-tub maker Shenzhen Kingston Sanitary Ware.

“Some of our clients choose to wait and see and hold off from placing orders, due to concerns over the coronavirus,” Liu said via a messaging app. “Thus we are likely to miss the peak season of sales to Europe in March.”

Add up the effects of lower consumption, investment and a pause in manufacturing, and the impact from the virus could knock China’s first-quarter gross domestic product growth down to 4.5% -- the lowest since the quarterly data begins in 1992 -- from 6% in the final three months of 2019, estimated Chang Shu, chief Asia economist for Bloomberg Economics. The biggest knock-on effects would be felt by Hong Kong, followed by South Korea and Japan, she wrote. Germany and Japan might take a 0.2% hit to GDP, while the U.S. and U.K. would absorb a 0.1% blow.

It’s survivable, and fiscal stimulus from Beijing could even lessen the blow. On the other hand, the estimate assumes the outbreak is contained to China. And “the longer factory output is affected, the bigger the risk China’s dominant position in global supply chains disrupts activity elsewhere,” the economist wrote.

Shell (LON: ) Shock

Within and outside China’s borders, the virus is bringing up flashbacks to the height of last year’s trade war with the U.S., when global companies raced to find alternatives to their Chinese suppliers and avoid tariffs.

The outbreak could spur more businesses to move manufacturing to the U.S. and Mexico, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business this week. What’s clear is that the virus is adding another layer of complexity for businesses that were just beginning to breathe a sigh of relief over trade tensions.

“This virus outbreak may be even a bigger hit to us than the U.S.-China trade war,” said Melissa Shu, export manager at E.D. Opto Electrical Lighting Co.’s auto-parts factory in Zhenjiang City.

Decades of globalization have made leaders at large corporations comfortable with the logistical challenge of moving resources from place to place and responding nimbly to geopolitical shifts. But 2019 was a lot for anyone to handle, and the thought of contending with a potentially lethal virus in 2020 is giving even the most hardened executives pause.

“Between the virus and the tariffs and the protests in Hong Kong -- I’m waiting for the locusts,” said Emanuel Chirico, CEO of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH Corp (NYSE: ). He said it’s too early to determine the impact the virus will have on the apparel industry.

“The honest answer is nobody really knows yet.”",https://uk.investing.com//news/economy/the-coronavirus-is-infecting-the-global-economy-heres-how-2043069,0.06,0.887,0.053,-0.8821

By Ron Bousso

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (L: ) raised its dividend and said it had completed a $1.5 billion share buyback programme in a sign of confidence in its growing oil and gas business on the last day in office for Chief Executive Bob Dudley.

BP shares were trading 4.5% higher at 1115 GMT on Tuesday, on course for their biggest daily gain in over a year after the company's profit beat forecasts for a twelfth quarter in a row.

As Bernard Looney prepares to take the helm, BP struck a positive tone even as oil prices slumped to a near year-low on concerns over China's coronavirus, bucking a trend among peers that saw a sharp slowdown in revenues last week.

The shareholder rewards came as the London-based company reported a 26% drop in fourth-quarter profit, which easily beat forecasts, and $2.7 billion in charges.

Cash flow rose by more than 10% in 2019 to $25.8 billion, despite lower commodity prices, as a result of higher production - particularly in U.S. shale following the acquisition of BHP assets.

Still, BP's debt-to-capital ratio, known as gearing, rose by the end of 2019 from a year earlier, even though BP sold $9.4 billion(7.23 billion pounds) of assets, underlying the strain oil companies face as demand for fuels and chemicals weakened last year.

""Solid delivery in a tough environment,"" Redburn analyst Stuart Joyner concluded in a note, adding the focus would be on reducing debt.

Rivals ExxonMobil (N: ), Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Chevron (N: ) reported sharp drops in 2019 revenues due to softer demand, particularly in Asia.

Dudley, 64, bows out after a decade at BP's helm. He was abruptly ushered in as CEO in October 2010 after his predecessor Tony Hayward stepped down in the wake of the deadly Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

He has since led the company through a deep and long downturn and rising pressure from investors to adapt to the transition to more renewable energy.

Looney, who takes over on Wednesday, is planning to expand BP's climate targets and is considering a major overhaul to the structure of the 111-year-old company.

""I am proud to be handing over a safer and stronger BP to Bernard and his team. I am confident that under their leadership, BP will continue to successfully navigate the rapidly-changing energy landscape,"" Dudley said in a statement.

STRONG OIL TRADING

BP reported $2.57 billion in fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, exceeding analysts' forecast of $2.1 billion in a company-provided poll.

That was down from $3.5 billion a year earlier, but up from $2.3 billion in the third quarter.

The results were driven by a lower tax rate and stronger-than-expected performance of the oil and gas production unit, or upstream, which saw output rise in 2019 by 3.8% to 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by a doubling of output from U.S. shale oil following the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's assets in late 2018.

Refining profits dropped by a third in the fourth quarter to $1.44 billion due to a weaker performance of BP's large oil trading business.

""Our oil trading result was not as strong as the previous quarters even if it had a record year overall,"" Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary, who steps down in June, told Reuters.

BP raised its dividend by 2.4% to 10.5 cents per share, the second increase since the BHP acquisition.

BP also denied media reports it was considering selling its 10.75% stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft (MM: ).

""Rosneft is one of our closest strategic partners,"" Gilvary said.

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 tumbled to a seven-week low on Friday as the first cases of coronavirus in Britain fanned concerns over the economic impact to the country, which is set to leave the European Union later in the day.

The main index ( ) gave up 1.3%, capping off its worst weekly performance in over a year, while the FTSE 250 ( ) handed back earlier gains to close 0.7% lower.

After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global emergency over the China-linked virus, news that two patients had tested positive for coronavirus kept investors firmly away from risky assets.

""Dealers are dumping stocks for fear the health crisis will curtain economic activity in China, and to a lesser extent the rest of the world – should the situation keep spreading,"" CMC Markets analyst David Madden wrote.

Both British benchmark indexes shed more than 3% this month.

HSBC (L: ), BP (L: ) and Shell (L: ) were among the biggest drags on the index.

Investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown (L: ) was the biggest loser on the blue-chip bourse, dropping 8.2% as half-year results showed a slowdown in net new business growth.

A noteworthy gainer across the board was luxury carmaker Aston Martin (L: ), which soared 24% on its best ever day after Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll said he would take a stake in the company.

News-related moves spurred sharp declines among smaller stocks.

(Reuters) - London's main index bounced back on Monday after hitting a seven-week low in the previous session, when news of the first cases of the coronavirus in Britain hammered equities and fanned worries over its impact to the global economy.

On the first trading day after Britain's exit from the European Union, the FTSE 100 ( ) and the FTSE 250 ( ) added 0.2% each.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 was partly supported by exporter stocks such as Diageo Plc (L: ) as the pound weakened, though gains were countered by a drop in oil major Shell (L: ) as crude prices slid. [O/R]

Stock markets in Britain were in stark contrast to those in China, where shares plunged in the first trading session following an extended Lunar New Year break, as the death toll from the virus outbreak rose to 361 in the Asian country.

""As yet the spread of the virus has not reached epidemic levels in Europe or the U.S., but we are entering a key period now and a sharp escalation in cases closer to home would spook the markets,"" Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said.

""I would consider the script is likely to be the same as last week with dips drawing in buyers, but for these rallies to lack any conviction.""

Though a sharp drop in stock valuations due to the epidemic has made for a more attractive entry point for some dealers, the broader impact has been firmly negative.

Both British benchmark indexes shed more than 3% last month as the outbreak sapped risk appetite, while global stocks also tumbled.

London-listed shares of Ryanair Holdings Plc (L: ) jumped 4.2% on Monday after the Irish carrier raised its annual profit forecast, citing a better-than-expected performance over Christmas and New Year.

Shares of peer easyJet Plc (L: ) advanced 1.5% on the main bourse.

An index of housebuilders ( ) rose 0.5% after Credit Suisse (SIX: ) began coverage of the sector with a ""positive stance"".

Among midcaps, Future Plc (L: ) gained 6.4% after the publisher forecast its full-year results to be materially ahead of market expectations. Small-cap peer Reach Plc (L: ) also rose more than 6%.

A notable loser was payments firm Finablr Plc (L: ), which gave up almost 4%. Its unit, Travelex, said on Friday it had partially restored its UK website, more than a month after a crippling ransomware attack.

Brokerage EFG Hermes also downgraded Finablr's stock, which has lost more than half its value since the attack late last year.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/ftse-100-rebounds-from-sevenweek-low-ryanair-rises-2043456,0.08,0.844,0.076,-0.1668

LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) downgraded ExxonMobil (N: ) to ""sell"" following disappointing fourth-quarter results, as the Wall Street bank forecasted the oil and gas company will meet only half of its targeted returns by 2025.

Irving, Texas-based Exxon's results missed Wall Street's recently lowered estimates, with earnings sliding to $5.6 billion(4.27 billion pounds) from $6 billion a year ago as weak oil and gas prices, sliding refining and chemicals profit margins offset a sharp increase in oil and gas production.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods described the margin weakness as ""a short-term impact"".

But Goldman said its decision to downgrade Exxon from ""neutral"" stemmed from ""lack of free cashflow limiting capital returns, and risk to long-term return on capital employed (ROCE)targets"".

Goldman said it saw ""clear downside"" to Exxon's target of reaching 15% ROCE by 2025, with its own modelling now showing 8% ROCE due to lower downstream margins, lower prices and risks to execution of projects.

Goldman lowered Exxon's share price target from $72 to $59. Exxon shares closed at $62.1 on Friday.

Investing.com -- BP (LON: ) chief executive Bob Dudley bowed out on the sweetest of high notes on Tuesday, raising the company’s dividend less than a week after arch-rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) had been forced to cut the rate at which it returns cash to shareholders.

The company raised its quarterly payout to 10.5 cents a share, from 10.25c previously, after its preferred measure of underlying profit fell less than expected in the fourth quarter of the year. According to data compiled by Investing.com, that takes the yield on one of the U.K. 100’s most reliable dividends up to 7%. The BP (LON: ) share price rose 4.5% in response, while the FTSE 100 rose only 1.2%. The benchmark index was up 1.0%.

By contrast, Shell (LON: ) had been forced to cut its buyback plans for this year by 60%, and while it left its dividend untouched, the accompanying rise in net debt put questions marks over its ability to stay so free with its cash. Shell, for its part, is now yielding 7.39%.

BP (LON: ), at least, is bringing in more cash in these days than it used to. The acquisition of BHP’s shale assets in the U.S. kept the expected decline in upstream profit to less than one-third, and the headwinds from the Gulf of Mexico spill a decade ago continue to drop: this year, BP will pay less than $1 billion in costs related to that accident, down from $2.4 billion last year.

But the sustainability of the new dividend is still likely to be tested. Production is likely to fall from last year’s average of 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the current quarter due to the ongoing disposal program, while the company also expects lower refining margins and bigger discounts for its heavier north American crude blends.

Most worrying, naturally, is the impact of the novel coronavirus on global oil demand. Chief financial officer Brian Gilvary told Bloomberg on Tuesday that the company sees the virus wiping out one-third of all forecast demand growth this year – a reality check to those still hoping for a V-shaped rebound in global demand and economic activity. Gilvary said the demand destruction is likely to be in the range of 300,000-500,000 barrels a day.

prices dropped below $55 a barrel for the first time since the end of 2018 on Tuesday, before recovering to trade at $54.86 a barrel by 5:25 AM ET (1025 GMT). BP (LON: ) has set itself the target of generating a return on average capital employed of over 10% at that price level by 2021, while keeping gearing below 30%.

Given that BP (LON: ) and other majors weren’t able to cover their capex and dividends at even $60 a barrel the last time oil prices collapsed in 2015/6, this represents some remarkable progress. But, as Tuesday’s presentation made clear, it depends on rapid sales of marginal assets. BP is targeting over $15 billion in disposal proceeds by the middle of next year. The company may be well on top of its core projects, but unless crude prices turn around, the risk is that it will have to sell some of its better assets to meet that target.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/stockbeat--dudley-bows-out-of-bp-with-a-flourish-2044371,0.076,0.848,0.076,0.2803

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open higher Tuesday, helped by the Chinese markets rebounding after Monday’s plunge, although disappointing guidance from brewer Carlsberg (CSE: ) was a fresh reminder of the risks associated with the coronavirus.

At 02:05 ET (0705 GMT), the contract traded 107 points, or 0.8% higher. France's were up 41 points, or 0.7%, while the contract in the U.K. rose 62 points, or 0.9%. Futures on the pan-eurozone , climbed 29 points, or 0.8%.

Carlsberg (CSE: ) on Tuesday reported operating profit for the second half of the year that was broadly in line with expectations but the brewer said it expects to deliver only mid-single-digit organic operating profit growth in 2020, down from last year.

The country's central bank has tried to mitigate the economic damage caused by the shutdown instigated to try and curb the spread of the virus, by trimming interest rates and injecting 1.2 trillion yuan of liquidity into the markets.

Elsewhere, BP (LON: ) struck a sharp contrast with arch-rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) as is boosted its dividend payout. A 26% drop in fourth-quarter profit on lower oil and gas prices still beat forecasts.

Earlier Tuesday, financial markets on the Chinese mainland reversed some of the steep losses of Monday, when they reopened after an extended Lunar New Year holiday. The blue-chip index closed over 1% higher, compared with Monday’s drop of 7.7%.

Additionally, China’s securities regulator sought to limit short selling and stop mutual fund managers selling shares unless they face investor redemptions, Reuters reported.

The number of coronavirus deaths in China still climbs, reaching 425 as of the end of Monday, from over 20,000 cases. And there are no signs that the economic shutdown will end anytime soon. Macau, the world's biggest gambling hub, is asking casinos to close temporarily to curb the coronavirus spread, while Hong Kong reported a death from the disease.

Turning back to Europe, the economic data calendar is a little bare, with just the U.K. construction PMI data for January and eurozone producer prices of note, leaving eyes to focus on the ongoing earnings season.

Elsewhere in Europe, jeweler Pandora's (CSE: ) fourth-quarter operating profit beat forecasts despite disappointing sales in China, but it said its 2020 organic sales growth will fall by 3%-6%.

On Wall Street, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) reported after hours Monday, missing analysts' estimates while offering up its worst fourth-quarter revenue growth since 2015.

The earnings releases will continue today from the likes of Snap (NYSE: ) and Walt Disney (NYSE: ), while eyes will also be on the State of the Union speech by U.S. President Donald Trump as his impeachment trial continues.

Oil prices rose on Tuesday with technical experts from OPEC+ expected to meet at the cartel’s Vienna headquarters later in the day to study the coronavirus' impact. There has been talk that the group will decide to cut production to try and raise prices from these weak levels.

AT 02:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), futures traded 1% higher at $50.59 and the international benchmark contract rose 0.6% to $54.81. for February delivery on New York’s COMEX, by contrast, were 0.4% lower at $1,575.95.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/stocks--europe-boosted-by-china-rebound-2044279,0.078,0.852,0.07,-0.7906

Oil giant BP (LON: ) struck a sharp contrast with arch-rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) when it posted its full-year results, boosting its dividend payout. A 26% drop in fourth-quarter profit on lower oil and gas prices still beat forecasts. BP shares climbed 3.8%.

Shares in Glencore (LON: ) climbed over 5% after the commodity trading and mining company maintained its 2020 targets unchanged despite a weak end to 2019. The world's biggest miner posted a 6% fall in fourth-quarter production and a 13% decline in cobalt.

Carlsberg (CSE: ) on Tuesday reported operating profit for the second half of the year that was broadly in line with expectations, but the brewer said it expects to deliver only mid-single-digit organic operating profit growth in 2020, down from last year. Still, shares rose 1.6% after worries it could be harder hit.

Earlier Tuesday, financial markets on the Chinese mainland reversed some of the steep losses of Monday, when they reopened after an extended Lunar New Year holiday. The blue-chip index closed over 1% higher, compared with Monday’s drop of 7.7%, thanks mainly to the People's Bank of China saying it will inject a total of 500 billion yuan into the money market to ""maintain reasonable and adequate liquidity in the banking system during the period of epidemic prevention and control.""

The country's central bank had already trimmed interest rates and injected 1.2 trillion yuan into the markets on Monday, although most of that was rolling over liquidity it had provided before the holidays.

Additionally, China’s securities regulator sought to limit short selling and stop mutual fund managers selling shares unless they face investor redemptions, Reuters reported.

Turning back to Europe, the economic data calendar is a little bare, with just the U.K. construction PMI data for January and eurozone producer prices of note, leaving eyes to focus on the ongoing earnings season.

Jeweler Pandora's fourth-quarter operating profit beat forecasts despite disappointing sales in China, but it said its 2020 organic sales growth will fall by 3%-6%. Shares dropped 3.5%.

On Wall Street, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) reported after hours Monday, missing analysts' estimates while offering up its worst fourth-quarter revenue growth since 2015.

The earnings releases will continue today from the likes of Snap (NYSE: ) and Walt Disney (NYSE: ), while eyes will also be on the State of the Union speech by U.S. President Donald Trump as his impeachment trial continues.

Oil prices rose on Tuesday with technical experts from OPEC+ expected to meet at the cartel’s Vienna headquarters later in the day to study the coronavirus' impact. There has been talk that the group will decide to cut production to try and raise prices from these weak levels.

AT 03:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), futures traded 1.2% higher at $50.73 and the international benchmark contract rose 0.7% to $54.80. for February delivery on New York’s COMEX, by contrast, were 0.6% lower at $1,572.95.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/stocks--europe-pushes-higher-helped-by-china-cash-injection-bp-update-2044321,0.042,0.854,0.105,0.9916

LONDON (Reuters) - North Sea private equity-backed Chrysaor's talks to buy smaller regional rival Siccar Point have ended after a large gap between their price expectations, three sources close to the process said.

The breakdown in negotiations highlights difficulties oil and gas producers are facing with the long-term outlook for prices uncertain as economies shift away from fossil fuels.

Chrysaor offered around $1.6 billion to acquire Siccar Point in the second bidding round on Jan. 13, the only bid to acquire the entire company which is backed by private equity firms Blackstone (N: ) and Blue Water Energy, the sources said.

Siccar Point's owners are seeking around $3 billion, but a drop in oil and gas prices in recent months and a weak outlook for prices, particularly for , have led bidders to lower their offers, the sources said.

Siccar Point also had bids from a number of buyers to acquire parts of its assets. It was not immediately clear if any offers will be accepted.

Siccar Point, Blackstone and Chrysaor declined to comment.

EIG-backed Chrysaor became the North Sea's largest producer after acquiring large portfolios from Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) in 2017 and ConocoPhillips (N: ) last year.

Siccar Point became a major North Sea player after acquiring OMV's portfolio for $870 million in January 2017. Its owners have not disclosed how much they have since invested.

With around 600 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in resources and reserves, Siccar Point expects its output to reach about 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) by about 2027 from just over 10,000 boed currently, mostly through the development of major new fields.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/chrysaor-talks-to-buy-north-sea-rival-siccar-point-end--sources-2042542,0.047,0.923,0.03,-0.8114

LONDON (Reuters) - The Church of England's 2.8 billion pound pension fund has put 600 million pounds into a climate index which includes Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Repsol (MC: ), but shuns BP (LON: ), Exxon and Chevron (NYSE: ).

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Environmental activists chanting ""keep it in the ground"" blocked the entrance to Shell's headquarters in The Hague on Friday, protesting at the energy company's role in climate change, until police dragged them away, detaining 30.

Some of the environmentalists from the Extinction Rebellion and Shell (LON: ) Must Fall! lobby groups wedged themselves between the glass front doors of the building. Others held banners and splashed a black liquid on its front steps, chanting slogans including ""ExxonMobil (NYSE: ), BP (LON: ), Shell: take your oil and go to hell!""

""Shell is one of the biggest polluters,"" said one woman who had glued herself to a railing outside the building. She declined to give her name. ""If we want to have a chance for stopping climate change, Shell is one of the first companies that has to go.""

In a statement, the groups said they were motivated by what they said was hypocrisy by Shell.

""Shell claims regularly that it is 'part of the solution' to the climate crisis, but at the same time the company announced its intention last year to increase its tens of billions of (dollars in) investments in fossil fuels.""

Police spokesman Stefan van Sande said 30 activists had been detained because they did not have a permit.

In a reaction to the protest, Shell said it respects the activists' right to demonstrate.

""We ask only that they do so within the law and with their safety and the safety of others in mind"".

The company said that its strategy is in alignment with international climate treaties. ""In that sense we have the same goal as the activists.

(Reuters) - UK shares tumbled on Thursday as the rising death toll from the coronavirus outbreak led investors away from risky assets like stocks and at home the Bank of England kept interest rates unchanged, while Shell and BT slid on disappointing earnings.

The main index ( ) fell by 1.4% to levels not seen since mid-December and the FTSE 250 ( ) slid 0.9%, as a modest rebound that the indexes had managed over the last two sessions unravelled.

Countries have begun isolating hundreds of citizens evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan to stop the virus from spreading, and the World Health Organization may on Thursday reassess its stance on the outbreak.

""Fears of a pandemic may be over-egging the pudding, but there is again a clear risk-off mood in the market,"" Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said.

The FTSE 100 has shed nearly 4% since last week when news of the coronavirus flare-up first emerged.

""Expect to see further declines and more volatility in risk assets in the coming days. Investors who were waiting for the dips to buy may need to wait a little longer,"" FXTM analyst Han Tan said.

News that England's central bank chose not to cut interest rates at Governor Mark Carney's final policy meeting lifted sterling and in turn accelerated losses for dollar earners.

""Carney ended up giving the pound a goodbye kiss rather than kick, the Bank of England voting to keep interest rates unchanged, booting any potential cut into the Andrew Bailey era,"" Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell wrote.

The biggest drag to the blue-chip bourse came from Shell (L: ), which slid 4.4% to its lowest level since July 2017 after fourth-quarter profit halved and the oil major cut the pace of its $25 billion share buyback programme.

Weaker crude prices also weighed on shares of Shell and peer BP (L: ), as oil stocks made up more than half of the blue-chip bourse's losses. [O/R]

Telecom firm BT (L: ) slumped 8% on its worst day in three years after it reported a steeper-than-expected drop in quarterly revenue and said Britain's decision to limit Huawei's [HWT.UL] role in building 5G and fibre networks would bump up costs.

Around midday, travel group Carnival's (L: ) UK-listed stock stumbled as much as 11% to a three-low year after news of potential coronavirus infection on one of its cruise ships. Shares ended down 5.1%.

Outperforming the main index was Unilever (L: ), which added 2% after the consumer goods company launched a strategic review of its tea business.

LONDON (Reuters) - The number of years of production left in Royal Dutch Shell's (L: ) oil and gas reserves fell for the sixth year in a row in 2019 to below eight.

But there was little reaction from investors to the steady decline in what was once considered a key metric for gauging the strength of the world's major oil and gas companies.

There is a growing perception the world holds enough oil and gas to meet demand many times over, especially against the backdrop of a gradual shift away from fossil fuels because of concerns about climate change. https://reut.rs/2GBtBvC

""The days of companies having 15 years of reserves have largely gone,"" said Redburn analyst Stuart Joyner. ""With the energy transition you would expect reserve life to come down.""

Shell was rocked in 2003 when it revealed it had inflated its oil and gas reserves for years, leading to the sacking of its chairman and chief financial officer.

The company's so-called reserve life last increased in 2013 to just below 12 years but it has been on a downward trend ever since and hit 7.9 years in 2019.

The reserve life of several of the world's biggest oil and gas companies, including BP (L: ) and Total (PA: ), has dropped in recent years but Shell's is now significantly below the industry average in 2018 of about 11 years.

Investors closely monitored oil and gas companies' reserves for decades, especially during the rapid growth in Chinese demand from the turn of the century.

But after the 2014 oil price crash, the focus shifted to companies' profitability, leading many to sell assets to raise capital, which in turn led to a decline in reserves.

Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden told analysts on Thursday that the decline in reserve life, ""doesn't represent the truly integrated and diverse portfolio we have or our focus of value over volume"".

The low reserve ratio could nevertheless prove to be a problem for Shell as it is seeking to sell more oil and gas assets to lower its debt burden and pay for a $25 billion share buyback programme, Joyner said.

To partly offset any concerns over the decline, Shell plans to tap third-party reserves from developments such as Canada's giant liquefied (LNG) project, he said.

Investing.com -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) shares tumbled to their lowest in nearly three years on Thursday after the company unveiled a wretched set of figures for the fourth quarter of 2019, hit by falling operating margins and big writedowns on investments in North American shale gas and elsewhere.

The hit was so severe that the Anglo-Dutch giant said it would slow the pace of share buybacks to only $1 billion in the current quarter, from an average of $2.5 billion a quarter over the last 18 months.

In the three months to December, it had bought $2.8 billion, but that had only been made possible by allowing the debt reduction target to slip. Gearing, the ratio of debt to equity, rose to 29.3% from 27.9% three months earlier – drifting further away from its medium-term target of 25%.

Gearing, of course, depends on the value of the company’s equity as well as its debt, and that was hit by some painful writedowns, notably $1.65 billion mainly related to U.S. shale gas assets. The company joins an ever-growing list of majors forced to admitted their bet on shale has turned sour: Chevron (NYSE: ), BP (LON: ) and Equinor (OL: ) have all already taken similar hits, unable to escape the glut caused by associated gas coming out of new oil fields in the Permian and other shale basins.

Other impairments, notably in Australia and Singapore, took the total value of writedowns in the quarter to $2.94 billion, although the company was also able to soften the blow by booking some non-cash gains on derivatives and deferred tax positions.

It would be nice to think that Shell (LON: ) will be able to move on after putting the writedowns behind it. Unfortunately, that looks like wishful thinking. Margins in refining and marketing, and in chemicals, all weakened against a backdrop of soft Chinese demand in the fourth quarter, and the increasingly obvious impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy leaves little scope for an improvement any time soon.

The risk is that the coronavirus, having infected the Chinese economy, will force Shell (LON: ) to choose between higher leverage or suspending buybacks altogether. In an extreme case, it may even be forced to resort to a scrip dividend again to avoid any further rise in debt levels, a tactic it last used to keep shareholders happy for a couple of years after the BG Group acquisition. The only safe bet would seem to be that the dividend -- one of the most important for European pension funds -- will continue to be paid at its current level in one form or another. At a yield of 6.86%, that is no small consolation to long-term investors.

Shell (LON: ) CEO Ben van Beurden said on Thursday that the company’s intentions to complete the $25 billion program remains unchanged. But that language is intentionally and justifiably vague. With now trading below $60 a barrel and with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies seemingly not in any hurry to make any further cuts to their own production, to promise anything more would be folly.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-shell-hits-the-buyback-brakes-after-big-shale-writedown-2041252,0.088,0.834,0.078,-0.7264

9:10 AM ET: Navistar (NYSE: ) stock rose 54% after Volkswagen's truck unit Traton (DE: ) offered to buy the company for $2.9 billion

9:05 AM ET: Chevron (NYSE: ) stock fell 1.9% after the oil company swung to a $6.6 billion loss in the fourth quarter, as impairments on assets in the Gulf of Mexico, Canada and Appalachia came out close to the top end of an earlier warning.

The company had in December warned of up to $11 billion in asset writedowns and said it was considering the sale of its stake in the Appalachian shale and in the proposed Kitmat LNG project in Canada.

The news comes a day after Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) also took a hefty charge against its U.S. shale gas assets.

9:00 AM ET: Amgen (NASDAQ: ) stock fell 2.7% after the company issued disappointing guidance for 2020. The biotech expects EPS of $14.85-$15.60, well below consensus forecasts of $15.98, due to growing pressure on margins from biosimilars.

8:55 AM ET: Honeywell (NYSE: ) stock fell 1.5% after the company reported a drop in sales and earnings in the fourth quarter.

Adjusted for a string of asset disposals, sales rose 2% but were still slightly behind forecasts.

The company said underlying earnings will rise by between 5% and 10% this year, as its key aerospace division avoids significant damage from the Boeing (NYSE: ) 737 issue.

8:48 AM ET: Caterpillar (NYSE: ) stock fell 1.0% after saying earnings per share this year would be between $8.50 and $10. Even the top end of that range was below market consensus.

The company’s fourth-quarter earnings, however, came in ahead of expectations thanks to some determined cost control.

8:40 AM ET: Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 11.6% after its fourth-quarter profit raced past expectations, thanks to heavy investment in one-day shipping earlier in 2019, and to a rising contribution from its advertising business.

The surge takes Amazon's market capitalization over $1 trillion for the first time - the fourth U.S. company to do so after Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

However, operating income growth from the vital cloud server business AWS slowed, and the company’s international operations continued to lose money.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) stock fell 1.5% after the oil and gas major reported a 5.2% drop in fourth-quarter profit, citing weaker margins in its refining and chemical businesses.

IBM (NYSE: ) stock rose 6.x% after the company said late on Thursday that long-standing CEO Ginni Rometty will stand down. Rometty has overseen a long streak of falling revenue caused by the need to revamp IBM’s business model. That run was broken only in the last quarter.

Investing.com - European stock markets moved sharply lower Thursday, weighed by weakness in Asia as the death toll from the coronavirus continues to mount, and amid reports that the virus has now spread to India.

At 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the U.K.'s index was trading 51 points, or 0.7%, lower, France's was down 75 points, or 1.3%, while the lost 155 points, or 1.2%. The dropped 43 points, or 1.2%.

Overnight China's National Health Commission said the total number of confirmed deaths had reached 170 as of late Wednesday, with the number of infected patients approaching 8,000. Infections have been reported in at least 15 other countries and in every province of mainland China.

The efforts to curtail the growth of this virus are likely to have a significant negative shock on growth in the second largest economy in the world, something Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged during his press conference late Wednesday. The central bank decided to keep its interest rates on hold nonetheless.

JPMorgan (NYSE: ) economists on Thursday said these events could knock China's growth in this quarter from a previously-forecast 6.3% to 4.9%, for a year-on-year figure of 5.6%.

Turning back to Europe, the earnings season continues at a pace with a number of heavyweight companies reporting their latest figures.

Shares in Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) dropped 4% after the Anglo-Dutch energy giant reported a sharp fall in full-year net profit on Thursday, citing challenging macroeconomic conditions and lower oil and gas prices. The company also made heavy writedowns on various investments in North American gas, Australia and Trinidad & Tobago.

BT Group (LON: ) slumped over 4% after the telecoms giant reported a drop in sales and underlying profit for the nine months to December. CEO Philip Jansen also stated that the U.K.’s decision to allow Chinese firm Huawei limited access to the U.K.’s 5G phone network infrastructure would have “an impact of around 500 million pounds over the next five years.”

Deutsche Bank (DE: ) posted a hefty full-year net loss of 5.3 billion euros ($5.8 billion) as part of its huge restructuring. That said, this news is largely baked in and the company’s shares were the top performer in the , thanks to a windfall from bond trading in the fourth quarter.

Unilever (LON: ) said pretax profits for its full year fell by one-third, citing a significant slowdown in its South Asian markets. That said, its shares rose around 1% as the consumer goods company weighed up the sale of its tea business.

Shares in Diageo (LON: ) climbed 0.5% after the alcoholic beverages company reported 6% organic sales growth in the first half of its fiscal year in both North America and Asia Pacific.

Eyes will also be on the Bank of England, with an announcement from its rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee due at 07:00 AM ET (1200 GMT). There is a degree of uncertainty surrounding this meeting. A series of dovish comments by MPC members had stoked up expectations of a rate cut, but the economic data which have followed have generally been positive.

Investing.com -- The death toll from the coronavirus jumped again, although there were tentative signs of a slowdown in reports of new cases. Global stock and oil prices tumbled, and Wall Street is also set for a lower opening as a result. Tesla is set to surge to new record highs after a better-than-expected fourth quarter, while the U.S. will get its first reading of fourth-quarter GDP at 8:30 AM ET. And Mark Carney may do what Jerome Powell chose not to do and cut interest rates at the Bank of England, in what will be the Canadian's last meeting before giving up the governorship. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 30th January.

1. Coronavirus death toll rises as virus spreads further

China reported its biggest single-day jump in coronavirus deaths, the toll rising to 170 from 132 on Wednesday. The number of confirmed cases in China now stands at 7,711, up from 5,974 a day earlier.

The rate of growth in confirmed cases appears to be slowing to around 30% from 50% earlier in the week. Also, the fatality ratio remains well below that for the SARS epidemic, with only 2.2% of reported cases leading to death so far.

However, the disease continues to spread, with India reporting its first confirmed case. Elsewhere, Russia said it would close its (highly-porous) border with China. The World Health Organization is meeting again on Thursday to review its decision not to declare the outbreak a matter of global concern.

2. Q4 GDP reading to cast light on Fed inaction

The U.S. gets its first reading of in the fourth quarter of last year at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).

Analysts expect the annualized rate of growth to have stayed at the relatively modest 2.1%, as the slowdown caused by trade conflicts with China and others continues to drag.

The update comes a day after the Federal Reserve gave little sign of easing monetary policy further in the near term, even though Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank wasn’t happy with inflation still below target and remains alert to the risk of global disinflationary trends – trends that seem likely to be reinforced in the near term due to the impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy.

3. Stocks, oil tumble on virus fears again

U.S. stock markets are set to open sharply lower as the rising death toll from the coronavirus once again rattled confidence around the world, with participants also conscious that the Fed is not in any hurry to come and bail them out again.

By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), were down 227 points or 0.8%, while were down 0.8% and were down 0.7%.

That’s despite support from better-than-expected earnings late on Wednesday from large-caps Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Mondelez (NASDAQ: ) and .

oil futures also suffered, falling below $52 a barrel for the first time in three months.

The earnings stream out of Europe was mixed on Thursday, with Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) stock hitting a three-year low after heavy writedowns and falling margins forced it to slow its mammoth buyback program. Deutsche Bank (DE: ), by contrast, beat expectations, although its numbers were flattered by windfall gains in bond trading.

4. Carney to cut before leaving Bank of England?

The Bank of England will decide at 7 AM ET (1200 GMT) whether or not to cut its own official interest rates, a day before the U.K. formally ends its 46-year membership of the European Union.

The decision is set to be a close one, with analysts polled by Investing.com seeing a 6-3 vote in favor of keeping the bank’s key rate unchanged at 0.75%, despite a flurry of comments from policy-makers suggesting they were inclined to ease policy to shield it from a slowdown caused by Brexit uncertainty and the spillovers from the U.S.-China trade dispute.

Recent data – from house prices to the Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index – have produced more upside than downside surprises, which may incline the Monetary Policy Committee to wait until it sees the new government’s spending plans in March before taking the plunge.

The was rangebound around the $1.3000 level ahead of the decision, the last to be overseen by Governor Mark Carney before he departs.

5. Tesla's Q4 sets it up for surge to new record high

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) stock is set to hit new records at the opening after surging 11% in after-hours trading on the back of a stronger-than-expected quarterly report.

CEO and founder Elon Musk predicted that deliveries will “comfortably exceed” 500,000 this year, an increase of 35%, and also said he expected positive profit and cash flow figures to be the rule, rather than the exception, in future.

Both revenue and profit beat expectations in the fourth quarter, although revenue grew only 2% and the profit margin fell as the higher-volume, lower-margin Model 3 increasingly dominated the sales mix.

Elsewhere on Thursday, the company said it had entered into a partnership with CATL and LG Chem , the biggest makers of electric vehicle batteries in China and South Korea, to supply batteries for its electric cars.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell's (L: ) profit in the fourth quarter of 2019 fell by nearly 50% to $2.9 billion (2.21 billion pounds), missing forecasts and falling to its lowest in more than three years on weaker oil and gas prices.

(Reuters) - UK shares rebounded for a second straight day after a steep sell-off earlier this week on rising fears over the impact from the coronavirus, though the bounce lost some punch as oil majors dipped alongside crude prices on U.S. stockpile data.

The FTSE 100 index ( ), which had risen as much as 0.5% earlier, ended only marginally higher. Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) lagged after inventory and stockpiling data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The FTSE 250 ( ), which had slumped more than 2% on Monday, rose for the second consecutive session and added 0.2%.

""If yesterday's positive move was down to a combination of short covering and bargain hunting, the muted session today might be a sign that buyers are running out of steam,"" CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.

Avast (L: ) underperformed with a 5.5% drop, bringing its losses for the week to nearly 20%. It denied media reports and assured users that none of their personally identifiable information had been sold to a third party.

The cybersecurity company also said it was reviewing options for its trend analytics service which is at the centre of the data privacy concerns.

Both British benchmark indexes have shed more than 2% since last week, when news of the coronavirus flare-up first emerged. Dealers are still mulling over how the outbreak will affect the global economy.

""Markets will be yearning for signs that the outbreak is stabilising,"" FXTM analyst Han Tan said, but warned that a meaningful recovery in equities could be months away.

Market strategists at Societe Generale (PA: ) estimated global stock markets could fall 10% if the situation around the fast-spreading virus, which has killed more than 130 people, worsens.

Traders are also eyeing a U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting, in which the bank is likely to leave interest rates unchanged, but may address future headwinds due to the virus outbreak.

In other stock moves, wealth manager Quilter (L: ) jumped nearly 9% to top the midcaps after a rise in assets under management prompted upgrades by at least two brokerages.

(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks climbed as the Federal Reserve signaled it will remain on hold and after a flurry of solid earnings from bellwethers.

Boeing (NYSE: ) Co. rallied on news the planemaker burned less cash than expected. Treasury yields slid, while the dollar rose.

Fed Leaves Main Rate Unchanged, Saying Policy Is Appropriate

Markets have calmed somewhat from the coronavirus’ initial blow as the earnings season continued to roll in. With the highly anticipated Fed decision, investors have shifted their focus to corporate signals on how the viral outbreak may affect their operations. Heavyweights including Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: )., Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). and Tesla Inc. report results after the close.

Some other corporate highlights:

McDonald’s Corp.’s sales in its home market beat expectations.

Mastercard (NYSE: ) Inc., Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. reported better-than-estimated results.

AT&T Inc. topped earnings estimates as cost cuts helped offset steep TV-subscriber losses and higher spending on its media business.

EBay Inc., Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) Inc. and Xilinx Inc (NASDAQ: ). gave lackluster guidance.

(NASDAQ: ). gave lackluster guidance. At its first-ever investor day, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ). set a goal for return on equity of more than 13% in the next three years.

Elsewhere, oil fell after a government report showed the biggest jump in stockpiles since November. The European Parliament approved Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, clearing the way for the U.K. to leave the EU on Jan. 31 with an agreement that, for the time being, will avoid a chaotic rupture. The pound remained lower.

(Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks slumped to a seven-week low and sovereign bonds rallied amid mounting evidence that the coronavirus epidemic is disrupting the world’s second-largest economy.

A slew of companies have suspended some of their China operations for the time being in the effort to contain the disease, and economists have started cutting growth forecasts. Japanese shares slid more than 1%, and Korea, Hong Kong and Australia saw losses. Taiwan tumbled over 4% as that market came back from a holiday. U.S. futures dropped and Treasury yields added to declines. The yuan dipped offshore.

Foxconn’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. -- which makes most of the world’s iPhones, and has major facilities in China -- plunged as much as 10%. Japanese 10-year bond yields hit their lowest level since December and Australian ones slid below 1%.

With the death toll from the coronavirus rising to 170 and the number of cases continuing to rise, investors remain cautious. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the outbreak of the coronavirus will likely hit the Chinese economy and could spill wider, but it was too early to assess its impact on the U.S.

“At this point the real impact of the coronavirus depends on how fast the containment of the virus is,” Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at SEB, told Bloomberg TV in Singapore. “There is really a lot of uncertainty and we do not know when the peak of the infections will be.”

Powell also said he wasn’t satisfied with inflation running persistently below 2%, after he and his colleagues kept Fed policy on hold Wednesday.

Meantime, investors continue to assess the earnings outlook -- positive results from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). and Tesla Inc. overshadowed an underwhelming report from Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: ).

Royal Dutch Shell's (LON: ) profit slumped in the fourth quarter, raising doubts over the company’s ability to keep up with its share buyback program.

Our intention to complete the $25 billion share buyback programme is unchanged, but the pace remains subject to macro conditions and further debt reduction,"" CEO Ben van Beurden said in the company’s earnings release.

The company’s preferred measure of underlying profit fell to $2.93 billion dollars, while a net $2.06 billion in additional charges meant that reported net income fell to only $965 million. All of the company’s major divisions except LNG trading suffered declines in profit.

The biggest writedowns affected its north American shale gas portfolio, along with projects in Australia and Trinidad & Tobago. The writedowns were partially offset by gains on disposals of other assets.

BT Group (LON: ) said its results for the third quarter were below expectations, but the financial outlook for the full year remained on track.

The telecoms group said its outlook for the year remained unchanged but would be in the lower half of expectations, between 1.9 billion pounds and 2.1 billion pounds.

BT said costs relating to regulation, competition and investment in products affected its overall revenue and profits. Profits were down 3% to 5.9 billion pounds as a result of 2% fall in revenue to 17.1 billion pounds.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc slowed the pace of share buybacks as profit missed expectations, underscoring the pressure on Big Oil due to slumping prices and weaker refining.

The results set a gloomy tone for what is expected to be a broadly weaker set of quarterly results for the industry. The final months of last year saw gas trade at historic lows, while slowing economic growth shrank margins from making fuel and chemicals.

The Anglo-Dutch company first warned investors last quarter that it might not achieve its target of buying back $25 billion shares by the end of 2020. It reiterated that warning on Thursday and said the next tranche of share repurchases won’t exceed $1 billion, compared with $2.75 billion in the prior quarter.

“We remain committed to prudent capital discipline,” Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said. “Our intention to complete the $25 billion share buyback program is unchanged, but the pace remains subject to macro conditions and further debt reduction.”

Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $2.93 billion, down 48% from a year earlier and falling short of the average analyst estimate of $3.15 billion.

Shell’s American peers Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ) are due to report results on Friday. Exxon has already warned that earnings will be weaker than expected, while Chevron has flagged up a write-down of as much as $11 billion.

European peers BP (LON: ) Plc and Total SA (PA: ) will release their figures next week.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set for losses Thursday, along with the oil complex, while both gold and government bonds are in demand in a classic risk off move. This comes amid growing signs the efforts to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus in China are having a significant impact on growth.

At 02:10 ET (0710 GMT), the contract traded 105 points, or 0.8% lower. France's were down 43 points, or 0.7%, while the contract in the U.K. fell 49 points, or 0.7%. Futures on the pan-eurozone index, the , dropped 28 points, or 0.8%.

Additionally, futures traded 1.2% lower at $52.68 and the international benchmark contract fell 1.3% to $58.17. for February delivery on New York’s COMEX were 0.6% higher at $1,579.75.

The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury fell 3 basis points to a low of 1.56%, approaching levels not seen since October last year.

Overnight China's National Health Commission said the total number of confirmed deaths had reached 170 as of late Wednesday, with the number of infected patients approaching 8,000. Infections have been reported in at least 15 other countries and in every province of mainland China.

A large number of companies have suspended their China operations for the time being as part of the effort to contain the disease, while domestic and international airlines have cancelled flights.

All of these efforts are likely to have a significant negative shock on growth in the second largest economy in the world, something Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged during his press conference late Wednesday. He added it was too early to assess its impact on the U.S. The central bank decided to keep its interest rates on hold.

J.P. Morgan economists on Thursday said these events could knock China's growth in this quarter from a previously-forecast 6.3% to 4.9%, for a year-on-year figure of 5.6%.

""The SARS episode in 2003 suggests that the shock could lead to a large impact on economic activity, especially as the fear factor could restrict people's mobility,"" J.P. Morgan analysts wrote.

SARS is believed to have knocked at least 1.0% off Chinese gross domestic product back in 2003, said ING analysts, in a research note.

“In economic terms, however, the global economy has become more integrated and intertwined since 2003,” they added. “Consequently, the speed of the virus spreading could be faster than in 2003, while at the same time the negative impact on global growth could also be higher than in 2003.”

Turning back to Europe, the earnings season continues with heavyweight companies of the likes of Unilever (LON: ), Diageo (LON: ) and Shell (LON: ) reporting fourth quarter figures.

Eyes will also be on the , with an announcement from its rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee due at 07:00 AM ET (1200 GMT). There is a degree of uncertainty surrounding this meeting. A series of dovish comments by MPC members had stoked up expectations of a rate cut, but the economic data which have followed have generally been positive.

Additional economic data due Thursday include and Swiss leading indicators, EU consumer confidence and U.K. money supply.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/stocks--europe-to-weaken-earnings-from-unilever-shell-in-focus-2041158,0.053,0.897,0.05,-0.0082

Investing.com - European stock markets are set for losses Thursday, along with the oil complex, while both gold and government bonds are in demand in a classic risk off move. This comes amid growing signs the efforts to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus in China are having a significant impact on growth.

At 02:10 ET (0710 GMT), the contract traded 105 points, or 0.8% lower. France's were down 43 points, or 0.7%, while the contract in the U.K. fell 49 points, or 0.7%. Futures on the pan-eurozone index, the , dropped 28 points, or 0.8%.

Additionally, futures traded 1.2% lower at $52.68 and the international benchmark contract fell 1.3% to $58.17. for February delivery on New York’s COMEX were 0.6% higher at $1,579.75.

The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury fell 3 basis points to a low of 1.56%, approaching levels not seen since October last year.

Overnight China's National Health Commission said the total number of confirmed deaths had reached 170 as of late Wednesday, with the number of infected patients approaching 8,000. Infections have been reported in at least 15 other countries and in every province of mainland China.

A large number of companies have suspended their China operations for the time being as part of the effort to contain the disease, while domestic and international airlines have cancelled flights.

All of these efforts are likely to have a significant negative shock on growth in the second largest economy in the world, something Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged during his press conference late Wednesday. He added it was too early to assess its impact on the U.S. The central bank decided to keep its interest rates on hold.

J.P. Morgan economists on Thursday said these events could knock China's growth in this quarter from a previously-forecast 6.3% to 4.9%, for a year-on-year figure of 5.6%.

""The SARS episode in 2003 suggests that the shock could lead to a large impact on economic activity, especially as the fear factor could restrict people's mobility,"" J.P. Morgan analysts wrote.

SARS is believed to have knocked at least 1.0% off Chinese gross domestic product back in 2003, said ING analysts, in a research note.

“In economic terms, however, the global economy has become more integrated and intertwined since 2003,” they added. “Consequently, the speed of the virus spreading could be faster than in 2003, while at the same time the negative impact on global growth could also be higher than in 2003.”

Turning back to Europe, the earnings season continues with heavyweight companies of the likes of Unilever (LON: ), Diageo (LON: ) and Shell (LON: ) reporting fourth quarter figures.

Eyes will also be on the , with an announcement from its rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee due at 07:00 AM ET (1200 GMT). There is a degree of uncertainty surrounding this meeting. A series of dovish comments by MPC members had stoked up expectations of a rate cut, but the economic data which have followed have generally been positive.

(Bloomberg) -- Stocks in Asia traded mixed Wednesday after a rebound on Wall Street, with investors continuing to mull the economic dangers from the spreading coronavirus.

Hong Kong’s dropped about 2.5% as markets reopened Wednesday, with the city’s stocks catching up to the global slide since last week. China futures advanced.

Equities are showing signs of stabilizing after a slide that wiped about $1.5 trillion off the value of world stocks since Jan. 20. With earnings continuing to roll in, investors are looking for signs of how the disease is affecting operations in China. More than 5,974 people have been infected in China and at least 132 have died.

“We are seeing economic data points that support this continued recovery,” Susan Schmidt, a fund manager at Aviva (LON: ) Investors, told Bloomberg TV. “The coronavirus might have tamped that down just a bit, but overall management teams are coming back and giving a pretty positive outlook and feeling confident about their businesses.”

Elsewhere, oil rose after suffering from heavy declines in the wake of the coronavirus spreading.

(Bloomberg) -- Liquefied prices are poised to test record lows this year thanks to an onslaught of new supply and warmer winter temperatures curbing consumption.

The startup of new export projects from Australia to the U.S. has flooded the market, while brimming stockpiles in Europe and an expected slowdown in Chinese demand have dumped cold water on consumption prospects. LNG for spot delivery to North Asia is on track to hit an all-time low this summer, while gas prices in Europe and the U.S. are trading at the weakest seasonal levels since 1999.

“The global oversupply of LNG has been building and building and building,” said Ron Ozer, founder of gas-focused hedge fund Statar Capital LLC in New York. “The gas market can’t stomach the oversupply and warm weather, and it’s getting both.”

This is what the rock-bottom prices mean for the industry:

American Halt

U.S. gas exports have surged amid the nation’s shale boom, but plummeting prices may now throttle back shipments or encourage sustained maintenance while firms weather the storm. Producers and companies with offtake agreements may decide not to load cargoes because prices are too low to earn a profit after accounting for shipping costs.

With cargoes from the Gulf of Mexico currently priced around $2.65 per million Btu, cash margins are positive only because of weak U.S. benchmark prices, according to Robert Sims, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. There’s a chance that production could be reduced if the spread between benchmark Henry Hub and U.S. Gulf LNG narrows 25 cents, he said. Torbjorn Tornqvist, chief executive officer of Gunvor Group Ltd., the biggest independent LNG trader, sees the market about 50 cents away from shut downs.

“I think we can see even lower prices in the next few months,” Tornqvist said in an interview this week in Davos. “The supply and demand balance doesn’t look good.”

Contract Scrutiny

Buyers may demand revisions to long-term supply contracts, such as better pricing or the removal of restrictions on reselling cargoes. Japan’s Osaka Gas Co. has already taken action, moving an Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ).-led LNG joint-venture to arbitration in a bid to get lower rates.

Qatar, one of the world’s biggest suppliers and traditionally the strictest when it comes to pricing, may be showing some flexibility. The supplier has started offering more competitive price links, with the lowest seen to Korea Gas at 10.8% the price of oil, according to FGE, an energy consultant. That compares to 2008, when Qatar signed contracts with Chinese firms in the 16% range.

Investment Delays

After four years of belt-tightening, the amount of investments last year in new production capacity set a record. Companies including Qatar Petroleum, Novatek PJSC and Venture Global LNG Inc. sanctioned new plants from the U.S. to Russia.

But the current wave of additional supply and persistent weak global prices is challenging new projects seeking final investment decisions, according to Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ). The bank reduced its outlook for the number of projects reaching FID and revised lower its new supply outlook for the middle of the decade. The low price environment will also likely force Qatar to stagger or postpone its planned 64% capacity expansion, currently scheduled by 2027, according to FGE.

Profit Pain

Weak prices mean more pain for global energy majors including Total SA (PA: ) and Eni SpA, who have seen profits from gas-related businesses dwindle. Some European utilities -- who face mounting criticism for their use of fossil fuels -- may decide to follow peers that are ditching LNG altogether. Denmark’s Orsted A/S cited loss-making LNG operations for its decision to sell the business to Glencore (LON: ) Plc at the end of last year, while Spain’s Iberdrola (MC: ) SA completed its exit this month.

The Sunnier Side

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, the biggest trader of the fuel, has been able to stave off losses on LNG through contracts linked to oil, while leveraging the weak spot market. Most long-term LNG contracts are linked to the price of crude, which puts them about twice as expensive as prompt cargoes sourced on the spot market.

The world’s biggest importers of LNG, Japan’s Jera Co. and Korea Gas Corp., will benefit from lower prices and may be encouraged to shift more of their procurement to the spot market. Jera gets about 20% on spot or via short-term contracts, which run four years of less. That compares with an average of 32% across global LNG trade. Korea Gas bought about one-quarter of its imports on a spot basis in 2018. Still, the firms’ upside is limited as they will source most of the remainder through oil-linked contracts.

India’s transition toward gas may get a boost, as the nation’s price-sensitive buyers are poised to pick up more cargoes from the spot market, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a Jan. 16 note. Beneficiaries of the transition are gas aggregators like Gail India Ltd and Petronet LNG Ltd and city gas distributors, according to the bank.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/global-lng-poised-for-terrible-year-as-new-supply-floods-market-2037308,0.075,0.843,0.081,0.6858

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Oil majors are at the sharp end of the climate debate and face a bewildering balancing act to secure their futures.

It's a Catch-22 situation: to meet ambitious emissions targets by investing in low-carbon technologies, they will have to rely on revenue from expanding their businesses in oil and gas, for which there is still growing global demand.

On one hand, they must satisfy the big investors who are rewarding companies with progressive climate policies and dumping heavy polluters; yet on the other, they can't risk cutting the generous dividends that keep shareholders sweet.

How energy companies navigate this maze could determine the winners and losers in a lower-carbon future, and help govern whether the world can rein in warming. So no pressure, then.

The confusion has been thrown into stark relief this week at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, where oil majors, state oil giants and ministers have been debating behind closed doors in their biggest gathering of the year.

While climate activists, notably Greta Thunberg, have called for all fossil fuel production to be halted to avert catastrophe, U.S President Donald Trump has decried ""prophets of doom"" and hailed the economic importance of oil and gas.

""It feels like we are at the epicentre of this debate. We sit right there between energy needs and climate change,"" said Al Cook, executive vice-president of Norway's energy giant Equinor (OL: ).

""If you listen to Davos speeches, you've got some people who say only economic growth and energy matter. Others ask to stop oil and gas immediately. We need to find a way to balance this but the challenge is that you cannot always be popular with either side,"" Cook told Reuters.

CLEAN ENERGY: FRACTION OF CAPEX

Repsol (MC: ) is at the vanguard of an industry climate drive, announcing this year that it plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. As a result, Norway's wealth fund has doubled its stake in the Spanish energy firm.

Equinor has meanwhile launched a target to reduce emissions to near zero in Norwegian offshore production by 2050, and is co-investing in a $10 billion wind farm in Britain, the world's largest.

French oil major Total this year announced investments into one of the world's largest solar power plants, in Qatar. It also plans to open 20,000 power charging points in the Netherlands and invest in planting millions of trees in Peru.

Europe's top oil firms have all set carbon reduction goals of various breadth. Shell (LON: ) has set out an ""ambition"" to halve ""Scope 3"" emissions by 2050 from fuels and products sold to customers rather than from its own operations.

Reuters reported this week that BP (LON: ) is also looking to significantly broaden its targets.

Companies might tout green credentials to satisfy sustainable investors and activists, but how can they pay the bill?

Fatih Birol the head of the International Energy Agency, the energy watchdog for industrialised nations, said the reality was that industry investments in clean energy represented a small fraction of their spending.

""Last year only 1% of total capex went into clean technologies. But those investments will grow as companies have to balance their short-term profit goals with long-term social licence,"" he said.

""Some companies won't need to borrow more, some companies may need to borrow more, but no company will stay unaffected by the energy transition.""

He said the industry would focus in coming years on reducing methane emissions from their own operations, which constitute 15% of all global greenhouse emissions.

""This part can be done relatively inexpensively,"" he added. ""The more expensive part will include carbon capture and storage, offshore wind and increased use of hydrogen.""

THE TRUMP EFFECT

Another major challenge to climate action is a lack of a global consensus.

In the United States, where Trump is encouraging oil and gas production and has exited the Paris climate deal, oil majors lag their European rivals on emissions goals. Chevron (N: ) has set limited reduction targets while ExxonMobil (N: ) has no targets.

A U.S. energy boom has helped make the country one of the world's biggest gas flarers.

""No-one has been able to fill the previous political leadership role on climate change that was played by the U.S. in the past,"" said Majid Jafar, chief executive of UAE-based Crescent Petroleum.

Jafar argues that if the world replaced all coal with gas, it would achieve the Paris climate target of by keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The problem is that the biggest coal consumers, China and India, will not be able to do that for years if not decades, he said.

""The efforts of the West will be futile without bringing on board Asia and Africa, which are driving the growth in energy demand and emissions,"" he added.

Richard Herrington, head of earth sciences at London's National History Museum also said a speedy energy transition may simply be impossible.

""If the UK were to turn tomorrow all of its cars into electric ones, we would need twice the world annual cobalt and half of annual production,"" he said. ""You can imagine what happens if you scale it up to the whole world.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/oil-industry-in-davos-torn-between-greta-and-trump-2036664,0.053,0.83,0.117,0.9947

(Bloomberg) -- The world’s largest energy traders enjoyed one of their best ever years in 2019 as pipeline outages, dramatic changes in ship fuel regulations and Middle East conflicts shook up the global market.

The bonanza extended beyond the independent traders like Vitol Group and Trafigura Group Ltd. to the in-house units of oil giants Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, Total SA (PA: ) and BP (LON: ) Plc, which made billions of dollars in profits.

“By all accounts, 2019 was among the best years ever for the energy trading industry,” said Marco Dunand, the chief executive of Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., one of the five largest independent oil traders.

For the independents, the bumper year all but guarantees a fat bonus season for a group of companies that’s largely owned by their executives and senior staff. For the European oil companies, the trading boom will help Shell, BP and Total to weather a tough year in other parts of their business.

In interviews with senior traders and top executives, the consensus is that the industry benefited from a lucky mix of factors in the oil market. Recent investments in trading , power and liquefied natural gas also started to bear fruit.

First, a series of supply outages boosted the premiums that oil refiners pay over the benchmark price for some crudes. Early in 2019, Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuela, disrupting flows. Then, Russian shipments into Europe via the key Druzhba pipeline were halted after oil was tainted with a corrosive pollutant. And in September, Saudi exports were hindered after a terrorist attack against the country’s most important petroleum facility.

Some traders also profited from the so-called IMO2020 rules that force the world’s merchant shipping fleet to use fuel with a lower sulfur content. The rules have upended the oil-refining and maritime industries, causing gyrations in the price of fuel-oil and marine diesel.

The results provide some breathing room for a sector that’s under assault from falling margins. , the world’s most important benchmark, traded in a relatively narrow range of $52.51 to $75.60 a barrel through the year.

Vitol, Glencore (LON: ), Shell, BP and Total all declined to comment on their results.

The trend was already clear in the results of Trafigura, which reports earlier than others due to a fiscal year ending in September. Trafigura said its oil unit delivered a record gross profit of $1.7 billion last year.

$1 Billion Year

Elsewhere executives also expect a stellar year, even as they caution that they haven’t yet audited their financial statements or decided on the final writedowns against 2019 results. The oil-trading unit of Glencore Plc., for example, enjoyed its best ever result, according to people familiar with the matter. One person said Glencore expects to report earnings before interest and taxes of more than $1 billion in oil trading.

At Gunvor, chief executive Torbjorn Tornqvist said 2019 was “up there among the best years ever” for the trading house, in part thanks to its expansion into LNG, super-cooled natural gas that can be transported by vessel. “We have a good year across the board.”

Vitol, the world’s largest independent oil trader, expects to report earnings near $2 billion, one of its best results, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mercuria also enjoyed a “very good year,” its chief executive said.

Inside Big Oil, it was also a trading bonanza. Although better known for their oil fields, refineries and pump stations, Shell, BP and Total also run in-house trading businesses that are larger than the better-known independent dealers. Shell alone trades the equivalent of 13 million barrels a day of oil, dwarfing the nearly 7.5 million barrels a day at Vitol.

For BP and Shell, 2019 was one of the best years ever in trading, making several billions dollars, according to two people familiar with the matter. Shell alone made at least $1 billion in fuel-oil trading linked to the IMO2020 changes.

The results came despite mounting legal and regulatory pressures on some of the biggest trading houses. Glencore is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. Meanwhile, Vitol and Trafigura had their Geneva offices raided by Swiss prosecutors as part of a bribery investigation in Brazil. And Gunvor had to pay $95 million in Switzerland to settle a case that saw a former employee pay bribes to secure oil deals in the Republic of Congo and Ivory Coast.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/oil-traders-made-billions-in-2019-as-conflict-shook-the-market-2038391,0.057,0.809,0.133,0.9971

(Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks looked set for further losses Tuesday as concern over the economic and human impact of China’s deadly coronavirus rattled global markets. Treasuries rallied and the yen held gains.

Futures pointed lower in Japan and Australia, which reopens alongside South Korea after a holiday Monday. Chinese and Hong Kong markets remain closed. The S&P 500 Index fell the most in almost four months with chipmakers, cruise lines and casino operators among the hardest hit as investors fled companies with close links to China. A gauge of U.S. equity volatility surged above its one-year average. The sank, breaching key technical levels.

Equity Pounding Feels Awful But Is Pretty Much Right on Schedule

Investor concern that China has failed to contain the pneumonia-like virus -- which has killed at least 80 people and infected more than 2,700 -- roiled markets at the start of a week jam-packed with corporate earnings. The outbreak shattered a calm in markets that hasn’t seen a 1% up-or-down move in the S&P 500 since early October.

Traders Eye Technicals to Predict Where Latest Stock Rout Ends

“This is now a sell first, ask questions later situation,” said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at Russell. “Markets hate uncertainty, and the coronavirus is the ultimate uncertainty -- no one knows how badly it will impact the global economy. China is the biggest driver of global growth, so this couldn’t have started in a worse place.”

China’s financial markets will remain closed until next Monday after authorities extended the Lunar New Year break by three days as they grapple with the virus crisis.

Elsewhere, oil slipped to a more than three-month low, had its longest slump since 2014 and iron ore tumbled.

Rare Inversion Points to Potential End of U.S. Equity Rout

By Jennifer Hiller

HOUSTON (Reuters) - At Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ), CEO Darren Woods' plan to revive earnings at the largest U.S. oil and gas company is being sidetracked by the two businesses he knows best: chemicals and refining.

Another year of poor profit could require Exxon to re-evaluate its bold spending plans or weaken its ability to weather the next oil-price downturn, say oil analysts. Exxon already must borrow or sell assets to help cover shareholder dividends.

The world’s biggest publicly traded oil firm after Saudi Arabian Oil Co (SE: ), Exxon was long considered one of the best-managed majors and most capable of coping with volatile prices due to its size.

Those advantages have slipped in recent years, however, with the drop in once-steady earnings from chemicals. Its total shareholder returns of negative 13% in the five years through this month compare with a 25% gain at Chevron Corp (N: ) and 82% at BP Plc (L: ), according to Refinitiv.

Two years ago, CEO Woods promised to restore flagging earnings by heavily investing in operations even as rivals cut spending. The plan to crank up chemicals, refining and increase oil output pushes capital expenditures to as much as $35 billion this year, up from $19 billion in 2016, the year before Woods took over as CEO after running Exxon's refining and chemical businesses.

Last March, he forecast potential earnings could hit $25 billion this year and nearly $31 billion in 2021, close to the $32.5 billion it earned in 2014 before the oil-price collapse.

The hoped-for payoff, however, has run headlong into a global chemicals glut, tariffs on U.S. exports to China, and lower margins in fuels. Exxon's refining profit last year fell on equipment outages.

The company declined to comment ahead of quarterly earnings, expected on Friday.

On Monday, Exxon shares traded under $65 - close to their level of 10 years ago.

The company recently telegraphed weak fourth-quarter results because of chemicals and refining businesses. Wall Street cut profit forecasts through 2021 on the sour outlook for both. Exxon ""seems to be tracking way behind their own expectations,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson, who slashed his quarterly forecast by a third, to 55 cents a share.

CHEMICALS OVERBUILD

In chemicals, Woods expanded the company's output of polyethylene, a business where it has 9% of global production capacity, to benefit from demand for plastic bags, food packaging and consumer goods. Output rose last summer at the depth of the U.S.-China trade dispute, and industry margins for a key polyethylene fell 30% compared with levels between 2016 and 2018, said James Wilson, analyst at pricing provider ICIS.

""The industry ended up overbuilding,"" said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with investment firm Raymond James. ""Exxon, of course, is among the companies that led that build-out.""

In refining, outages and higher maintenance costs at Exxon refineries in the United States, Canada and Saudi Arabia hurt profit, according to regulatory filings.

prices and slack global demand from the trade dispute are squeezing profit across the industry, said Garfield Miller, chief executive at Aegis Energy Advisors.

This month, an Exxon regulatory filing implied a loss in chemicals of about $200 million for the fourth quarter, and refining earnings of just $400 million.

In contrast, chemicals and refining delivered $7 billion to $11 billion annually for Exxon between 2013 and 2018. In the first nine months of last year, the combined profit was $2.37 billion. Exxon's regulatory filing indicates 2019 earnings for the two at about $2.52 billion, the lowest in at least a decade.

Woods has halted the company's oil output declines by ramping up in shale. Oil volume has risen year-over-year for five straight quarters, reversing annual declines between 2016 and 2018.

TARIFFS HIT EXPORTS

Ending the trade dispute represents the biggest challenge. Global demand for the plastic resins and pellets that Exxon makes is rising, said Marc Levine, chief executive of Plantgistix, which provides logistics for U.S. plastic manufacturers.

""This is the first time in my lifetime and in the plastics industry's lifetime where we make plastics resin for export,"" said Levine.

China in 2018 placed an additional 25% tariff on U.S. polyethylene imports, a move that helped send North American margins to the lowest levels since 2011, said Joel Morales, a polymers analyst at consultancy IHS Markit.

""Imagine having a lot of something and your biggest, easiest consumer you can’t do business with,"" Morales said.

The January U.S.-China agreement does not remove Chinese or U.S. tariffs on chemicals, plastics or oil.

Exxon has ramped up asset sales, aiming to collect $15 billion by next year to balance spending. So far, results have been tepid. It expects to receive about $3.6 billion from selling Norwegian oil and gas production assets.

Weak demand for those assets comes as rivals have written off the value of their own properties. BP, Chevron, Equinor ASA (OL: ), Repsol SA (MC: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) last year cut a total of $22 billion primarily on U.S. assets due to sharply lower gas prices.

(Bloomberg) -- European stocks pared early gains alongside U.S. index futures on Tuesday amid international efforts to curb the SARS-like virus from spreading. The yuan steadied and Treasuries turned higher.

The Index erased an early advance, while contracts on the three main American equity indexes clung to moderate gains. Earlier in Asia, Japanese shares fell for a second day and equities slumped in South Korea as that market reopened after holidays. Trading is scheduled to resume in Hong Kong on Wednesday; the latest guidance from China, where the outbreak is still concentrated, is for markets to reopen on Monday.

The fluctuated after a sharp slide the previous day while the yen nudged higher for a sixth session. declined. While China reported a further increase in both the death toll and number of infected people from the virus, its top securities regulator encouraged investors to evaluate the impact of the deadly coronavirus “rationally and objectively.´´

Investors are keeping an eye out for a slew of earnings due this week including from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). on Tuesday while also monitoring the impact of the deadly coronavirus. Even as containment efforts intensify, the likelihood of the virus disrupting global businesses and the world’s second-largest economy appears to be growing.

“Risk appetite is unlikely to improve until we start getting news that the virus is under control,” DBS Group Holdings Ltd. strategists Philip Wee and Eugene Leow wrote in a note. “For now, the lack of positive news flow is likely to keep investors on the defensive.”

The outbreak shattered a calm in markets that hadn’t seen a 1% up-or-down move in the S&P 500 since early October. The latest surge in demand for havens also sent bond yields tumbling, with the global supply of notes with negative rates surpassing $13 trillion, to the highest since November.

(Reuters) - UK shares lost roughly 1% as worries over the spread of a new flu-like virus from China forced dealers to dump risky assets, while financial stocks tumbled across the board after the European Central Bank kept interest rates at a record low level.

The FTSE 100 ( ) gave up 0.9%, marking its steepest one-day drop in nearly two months and set for its worst weekly performance since early October. The midcaps ( ) ended 1% lower.

An index of miners ( ) hit its lowest in more than a month with a 3.1% drop, in line with a fall in prices.

Losses came after China put Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, on lockdown as health authorities around the world scramble to prevent a global pandemic. The new coronavirus has so far killed 17 and infected nearly 600 people.

InterContinental Hotels (L: ) slipped 4% after saying it would let customers change or cancel for free stays scheduled up to Feb. 3 across mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan as spread of the SARS-like virus deters tourists.

Other companies that rely on the travel market also took a hit. Airline easyJet (L: ) and cruise operator Carnival (L: ) were among the worst performers on the main board, each falling about 4%.

Banks ( ) weakened on both benchmark indexes, shedding 1.5% and in tandem with their European rivals after the European Central Bank kept policy unchanged as expected.

Among midcaps, PayPoint (L: ) skidded as much as 8% after the specialist consumer payment provider said its annual profit would grow at a more modest rate than previously expected. The stock ended down 3.3%.

Overall trading volumes were thin, with investors in Asia preparing to go away for the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays.

""It is thus quite understandable that some money would be taken off the table until the true extent of the coronavirus issue becomes obvious,"" OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said.

However, AIM-listed online fashion retailer ASOS (L: ) provided some cheer as it advanced 9% after beating sales growth expectations in the Christmas trading period.

Liberum analysts said ASOS revenue growth was well ahead of its consensus, suggesting that the company's focus on improving operations and execution was delivering initial results.

Baby products retailer Mothercare (L: ) tumbled 11.2% after saying reduction in debt owed to lenders, related to the collapse of its UK business, had fallen behind expectations and caused a shortfall of 10 million pounds.

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 recorded its longest losing streak since early December as a strengthening in sterling triggered by strong manufacturing sentiment data weighed on dollar earners, while travel group TUI slid on more Boeing woes.

The main index ( ) reversed earlier gains to decline 0.5% on its third consecutive day in the red.

Homebuilder Berkeley (L: ) limited losses on the index, jumping 5.4% to a record high after plans to return 450 million pounds more to shareholders. An index of housebuilders ( ) scaled over a two-year high on the news.

The FTSE 250 ( ) added 0.1%, buoyed by a stronger local currency.

The pound scaling a five-week high against the euro came as bets of a cut to the UK interest rate declined after the Confederation of British Industry reported a pick-up in manufacturers' sentiment.

That dragged on bluechip exporters including GlaxoSmithKline (L: ), HSBC (L: ) and British American Tobacco (L: ).

A standout faller was TUI (L: ), whose London-listed shares slipped nearly 6% to their lowest since September after Boeing (N: ) warned of further delay in returning its grounded 737 MAX airliner to service.

The FTSE 100 missed out as world shares held firm after Chinese authorities ramped up efforts to control the outbreak of the coronavirus, which is being likened to the 2002-2003 spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has already led to nine deaths.

Sage Group (L: ) outperformed the bourse with a 4% rise as the software provider reported higher quarterly revenue and affirmed its annual forecast.

But Burberry (L: ) slid 5% despite a solid performance through the Christmas quarter.

""The reminder of how closely the company's fortunes are tied to China may have provoked some nervousness given the deadly virus which is currently afflicting the country,"" AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.

He also suggested that there could be a hint of profit-taking, given the recent rally in shares.

Further driving the index lower was a dip in Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) as oil prices weakened, and miner Antofagasta (L: ) which fell 4.6% after its production was hit by civil unrest in Chile.

Small-cap fashion retailer Ted Baker (L: ) sank as much as 10% after it more than doubled its preliminary estimate of an overstatement in inventory.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian tax police searched the Milan offices of three managers at Eni (MI: ) on Thursday to widen an investigation into suspected obstruction of justice by officials at the Italian oil group, two sources said.

The inquiry is still in an early phase and has been overshadowed by an ongoing corruption trial centering on the 2011 purchase of a Nigerian oilfield by Eni and oil major Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ).

Milan prosecutors opened the obstruction case in 2018 to investigate whether in 2015 and 2016 Eni officials had sought to discredit two independent board members who later became witnesses in the Nigeria case.

On Thursday tax police searched the offices of Claudio Granata, chief services and stakeholder relations officer; Michele Bianco, executive vice president of legal affairs; and Alfio Rapisarda, senior vice president of security, the sources said.

Eni, which itself is under investigation, said it was confident the prosecutors' inquiries would show it was extraneous to the whole matter.

""Eni reiterates its firm view it was an offended party,"" the company said.

Prosecutors have not laid any charges against Eni officials or the group itself and their investigation may not lead to charges.

(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks climbed the most since October on speculation that efforts to contain the coronavirus will prevent a major economic fallout.

The S&P 500 Index rebounded from its worst sell-off in four months, with technology shares leading the charge. Some of the companies that suffered the biggest losses during the latest equity rout, such as chipmakers, casino operators and airlines, advanced on Tuesday.

Stocks Turnaround Got Few Cheering With Uncertainty Running High

Equities rallied after a slide that wiped about $1.5 trillion off the value of world stocks since Jan. 20. As it’s too early to assess the full impact of the deadly virus, traders digested some positive readings on U.S. consumer confidence and home prices. With earnings continuing to roll in, investors will be looking for signs of how the disease is affecting operations in China.

“We kind of stall a little bit on the Chinese recovery, but we have a lot of other things going in favor of a global recovery anyway,” Stephen Auth, chief investment officer of equities at Federated Investors, told Bloomberg TV. “We still think that’s coming.”

By Ron Bousso

LONDON (Reuters) - Change is afoot at BP . Incoming Chief Executive Bernard Looney plans to expand the company's climate targets and is considering overhauling the structure of the oil and gas major in one of the biggest shake-ups in its 111-year history.

The 49-year-old Irishman plans to adopt broader carbon emissions reduction goals that will likely include emissions from fuels and products sold to customers rather than just the far lower emissions from BP's own operations, according to four sources with knowledge of internal discussions with the new CEO.

The aim is to catch up with, and possibly outdo, rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Repsol (MC: ) as investor pressure over climate change mounts, said the sources who declined to be named as the plans have not yet been made public.

More stringent climate targets could lead to London-based BP (L: ) selling its most carbon-intensive businesses such as oil and gas fields in Angola and Canada, they added.

As part of the climate push, Looney is also looking at a broad reorganisation of the company aimed at cutting costs, with one idea being explored to merge parts of the upstream oil and gas production division with refining and petrochemical operations, said five sources.

The new CEO and his team of close advisers have held an intensive series of closed-door meetings in recent weeks to outline the new strategy, according to three of the sources.

They said he would outline his ""ambitions"" for the company in a speech on Feb. 12, a week after he takes over from Bob Dudley.

It is unclear if Looney has decided to adopt any structural changes at this stage.

A BP spokesman declined to comment.

Any new strategy will require a fine balancing act though, and is not without risk for a company whose pioneering efforts in the early 2000s to build a large renewable business, branded ""Beyond Petroleum"", ended with huge losses.

BP will have to rely on revenue from an expanding oil and gas business to fund its green ambitions while maintaining the generous dividends that keep investors on board.

Some industry experts say that business model may not be sustainable in a low-carbon future. They also point out that BP's emissions are rising, as its oil and gas exploration and production activity expands, while it spends just a fraction of its investment pot on renewable and low-carbon technologies.

""Looney is coming in at a crucial moment for the oil sector,"" said Morgan Stanley's global oil analyst Martijn Rats.

""Over the next decade, companies like BP will need to maintain supply of oil and gas, for which demand is continuing to grow. That will require ongoing investment. At the same time, they will need to prepare for a decarbonised future.""

""All the while, their investors will ask them to keep up these large dividend payments. Balancing these three demands will be the key challenge.""

BEYOND CARBON?

Looney, who is known for his energetic management style, wants to go beyond the carbon reduction targets that were set by Dudley in 2019 and limited to emissions from BP's own operations.

The new targets will likely encompass, for the first time, emissions from the fuels and products sold, known as Scope 3, which account for nearly 90% of BP's total emissions, according to the sources.

BP's current targets are to reduce emissions from its own operations to net zero by 2025, equivalent to cutting 3.5 million tonnes of CO2 compared with 2016. It also agreed in a resolution adopted by shareholders to align its business with the 2015 Paris climate agreement goals.

It is not clear what reduction targets the company could set for its Scope 3 emissions. The goals are however expected to be detailed at a strategy day later this year, the sources said.

Dudley, who became CEO almost a decade ago following the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that drove BP to the brink of bankruptcy, had long resisted setting Scope 3 targets, arguing the company could not control how its fuels were being used.

While Looney receives a financially solid company, he faces fierce pressure from shareholders and activists to do more to meet U.N.-backed goals to limit global warming. In Britain in particular, BP faces regular protests and calls for boycotts.

Europe's top oil firms have all set carbon reduction goals of various breadth. Scope 3 targets could align BP with its most climate-progressive rivals: Repsol, which aims become a net zero-carbon company by 2050; Shell which has set out an ""ambition"" to halve Scope 3 emissions by 2050; and Total (PA: ).

U.S. majors have lagged their European rivals, with Chevron (NYSE: ) setting limited reduction targets and ExxonMobil (NYSE: ) having no targets.

STRUCTURAL OVERHAUL

Looney, who joined BP in 1991 as a drilling engineer before rising through the ranks, is also considering overhauling the company's traditional structure, aiming to reduce costs as the outlook for oil and gas prices and consumption remains uncertain.

The idea being explored of merging parts of its upstream and downstream operations is driven by the fact that they share similar management objectives such as safety, cost efficiency and reduction of carbon emissions, according to the sources.

Under the proposed changes, BP would also form a unit focussed on its rapidly growing retail, marketing and power businesses. These businesses are expected to be central in the energy transition as customers switch to electric vehicles and global demand for electricity is set to soar in coming decades.

Rival Shell has already carried out a major shake-up, in 2016, establishing its integrated gas division as a separate segment following the acquisition of BG Group which sharply expanded its liquefied business (LNG).

France's Total created a gas, renewable and power division in 2016 as it prepared to expand it LNG and low-carbon operations, spinning off parts of its upstream operations.

Energy companies see natural gas as key for the energy transition, replacing more polluting coal in power generation.

'BALANCED BY REALITY'

Since being announced as Dudley's successor in October, Looney has shuttled around the world, visiting staff, partners and governments in BP's main hubs, from India and Azerbaijan to Senegal. He has also met investors, consultants, bankers and environmental groups.

""BP needs to be a willing and enthusiastic participant in the energy transition,"" said Alasdair McKinnon, manager at The Scottish Investment Trust (LON: ), which holds shares in the oil major.

""But this needs to be balanced by the current reality of the economics of the low-carbon technologies"" that are generally less profitable than oil and gas, he added.

The numbers underline the challenge Looney could face in meeting more ambitious emissions goals.

As things stand, BP's upstream emissions are set to grow by 4% between 2018 and 2025 due to higher oil and gas production in the wake of the 2018 acquisition of BHP Billiton's U.S. shale assets, HSBC said in a report, citing Wood Mackenzie data.

However, of the roughly $16 billion per year the company invests in its business, only about $500 million goes to renewable and low-carbon technologies.

BP, which made a profit of $7.4 billion in the first nine months of 2019, is also set to pay over $9 billion in dividend and share repurchases for the year.

""Bernard knows that doing more of the same won't win the day,"" said a senior BP official. ""He believes in oil and gas but is not blind to the consequences of using it and that it cannot last forever.""

SANDEFJORD, Norway (Reuters) - The Norwegian government has awarded 28 oil and gas companies a total of 69 offshore blocks to explore for petroleum in mature areas of its continental shelf, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate said on Tuesday.

Shell (L: ), ConocoPhillips (N: ), Total (PA: ) and Equinor (OL: ) won blocks, as did DNO (OL: ), Aker BP (OL: ), Lundin Petroleum (ST: ) and Eni's (MI: ) Vaar Energi.

Private-equity backed firms, such as Chrysoar, which acquired ConocoPhillips assets in the British North Sea last year, and Neptune Energy received stakes in eight and 13 blocks respectively.

Russia's Lukoil (MM: ), which holds stakes in two licences, and wholly-owned Rosneft (MM: ) subsidiary RN Nordic, a previous licenceholder, were not awarded any blocks. A ministry spokesman declined to comment on why.

The annual predefined areas (APA) licensing round covers blocks adjacent to acreage previously explored or developed, as opposed to licensing rounds in the country's frontier areas.

Thirty-three oil companies had submitted bids by a September deadline for a total of 90 offshore exploration blocks, including 48 in the Arctic Barents Sea.

The number of final awards depends on a range of factors, including Norway's requirement that each licence must have several owners.

Of this year's 69 licences, 33 were in the North Sea off southern Norway, 23 were in the Norwegian Sea off central and northern Norway and 13 were in the far-north Barents Sea.

Norway's oil and gas output is expected to rise sharply in the next several years as recent large discoveries come on stream, and authorities are keen to extend the lifespan of the oil and gas industry for decades to come.

""Hopefully, the exploration in the awarded acreage will result in new discoveries,"" Oil and Energy Minister Sylvi Listhaug told an industry conference in south-east Norway.

""This is important to ensure employment, value-creation and future government revenue for Norway's largest industry.""

Separate from the APA awards, Norway also conducts so-called numbered licensing rounds, which include frontier parts of the Norwegian continental shelf, where exploration is more risky, but where large finds could be made.

The government aims to announce the next numbered licensing round before Norway's 2021 general election, but must first agree an updated plan on areas to exempt due to environmental concerns, particularly in the Arctic.

The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) estimates that two-thirds of Norway's undiscovered oil and gas resources are in the Barents Sea, but exploration there has been disappointing in the last few years.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/norway-awards-69-oil-and-gas-exploration-blocks-2030574,0.029,0.89,0.081,0.9377

BEIJING/GUANGZHOU (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) to build its first commercial-scale polycarbonate production plant in southern city of Huizhou in China.

Polycarbonate is a transparent and impact-resistant polymer, widely used to make vehicle headlights and LED spotlights.

""(Huizhou city government) is in touch with Shell and CNOOC for detailed investment and production plans,"" said Liu Ji, mayor of Huizhou, on the sideline of a conference in Guangzhou on Thursday.

The MoU follows an agreement reached by the two energy giants in October 2018 that aims to build more production equipment at their jointly-owned petrochemical complex in Huizhou.

CNOOC and Shell Petrochemicals Corp (CSPC) has ethylene production capacity of 2.2 million tonnes.

Meanwhile, Shell has started constructing a polycarbonate development unit at its Jurong Island chemicals plant in Singapore as an interim step, the company said in a statement on Monday.

""(...)We have an advantaged route to production and are looking at investment in a number of commercial-scale units to serve the growing number of polycarbonate customers,"" Thomas Casparie, Executive Vice President of Shell's global chemicals business, said in the statement.

The Huizhou mayor also said the city was in talks to introduce a fine chemical project with a ""world-leading"" company into the city, without giving more details.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/royal-dutch-shell-signs-mou-with-chinas-cnooc-to-build-polycarbonate-plant-2032118,0.009,0.925,0.066,0.8467

LONDON (Reuters) - Two liquefied (LNG) managers at Gazprom Marketing & Trading's London office have left the company, sources said on Wednesday.

Jayesh Mistry, general manager for LNG and oil trading, has left, three sources said. Lawrence Darby who was responsible for LNG paper trading, has also left, one of the sources and another source said.

Gazprom Marketing & Trading is a trading arm of Russia's energy giant Gazprom (MM: ) which, sources told Reuters in March 2018, is reorganising its overseas trading and export operations with hundreds of jobs potentially moving to St Petersburg.

Mistry's and Darby's departures follow a number of resignations in Gazprom Marketing & Trading's Singapore LNG trading team in December. The traders who resigned then were Delia Proteasa, head of LNG trading, and Akshay Kaul and Aimie Parpia.

Gazprom Marketing & Trading declined to comment on Mistry's departure and did not reply to a request for comment on Darby. Neither Mistry, nor Darby were available for immediate comment.

Mistry has spent 10 years at Gazprom's (MM: ) London-based trading arm, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE: ) profile. He first served as director of global LNG trading and origination and in the past three years was general manager for LNG and oil trading.

His function in the London office was to manage a team responsible for Gazprom's Global LNG Trading book, his profile on Gazprom M&T's website said.

Darby joined Gazprom Marketing & Trading in June 2017 from Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), according to his LinkedIn profile which did not specify what position within the LNG team he occupied.

The two sources, who confirmed his departure, said he was managing the company's paper positions for LNG. One of the sources added that he started at Gazprom as an LNG physical trader before being transferred to the LNG paper trading team.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/two-londonbased-gazprom-lng-trading-managers-leave--sources-2031663,0.016,0.961,0.024,0.3818

(Bloomberg) -- Mexico has made key data on its sovereign oil hedge a state secret to shield the information from speculators and prevent cost increases, according to official documents seen by Bloomberg.

The move reduces transparency into the workings of the program, which is the largest oil transaction on Wall Street and often moves the market. The Mexican Finance Ministry will keep the data secret for five years, it told the government’s auditing body in a February 2019 letter.

That letter and a March 2018 resolution by the central bank show a concerted effort to officially protect the information. This year, the government provided only the approximate annual cost of the program -- $1 billion -- in contrast to the detailed data that it previously used to reveal.

The government hasn’t publicly confirmed that the information is officially a state secret. Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio told reporters in Mexico City Thursday that disclosing more data would raise the value of premiums paid for the hedge, without elaborating.

Mexico’s finance ministry declined to comment on its policy beyond what was said on Thursday. The central bank had no immediate comment.

“Several institutions outside the hedge could use the information to speculate, buying the same financial instruments ahead of the government, increasing considerably their price,” the central bank said in its March 2018 resolution.

The central bank argued that Mexico has in prior years paid more after Bloomberg News published a series of reports about the hedging program. “The volatility in and increased, generating also an increase in the price offered by the counterparts to the Banco de Mexico to cover its operations,” it said, referring to the two main oil-price benchmarks.

Massive Deal

The hedge has paid several times since its inception during the Gulf War in 1990-91. It yielded multibillion-dollar payouts in 2009 -- after the global financial crisis sent oil prices sharply lower -- and again in 2015, when a record of more than $6 billion was reaped, as well as in 2016.

As part of the oil hedge, Mexico buys put options -- contracts that give it the right to sell at a predetermined price -- with banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ). and energy companies like Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc.

The deal typically involves between 200 million barrels and 435 million barrels of crude, with a value as high as $20 billion.

Earlier this month, the government said it had insured the budget against crude prices dropping below $49 a barrel.

Mexico has historically disclosed the strike price of the put options and the actual cost of the deal, which runs from Dec. 1 to Nov. 30. Until last year, it reported the number of barrels hedged too.

The government used to reveal its lock-in price via the hedge as well as how many extra dollars per barrel it would cover through the Oil Revenues Stabilization Fund, known as FEIP.

In 2017, for example, Mexico hedged at $38 a barrel, and insured another $4 a barrel with the FEIP cash reserves, equal to the $42 level used to write the budget that year.

Additionally, it released even more granular detail over time when the body that audits the government reviewed the program, including when Mexico started and finished buying the options, the name of the banks it dealt with, and each bank’s share in the deal.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil giants familiar to fans of fossil-fuelled Formula One are finding a new focus for their energies in the all-electric world of Formula E.

Shell (LON: ), decades-long sponsors of F1 glamour team Ferrari (NYSE: ), are partnering the Nissan and Mahindra Formula E outfits while branding for French giant Total features on the cars of champions DS Techeetah.

They will be racing again in Saturday's ePrix in the Chilean capital Santiago.

""Most people looking at a Formula E car or indeed an electric road vehicle would think there’s no content from a company like ours,"" Richard Tucker, General Manager of Shell Lubricants Technology, told Reuters.

""But there are still lubricants and coolants involved in that technology, and we want to be pioneering in that space.""

Formula E, a city-based series now in its sixth season and soon to acquire FIA world championship status, has become the series of choice for car manufacturers looking to promote electric vehicles and test the technology.

Germany's big four of Porsche, Mercedes, BMW and Audi are competing alongside the likes of Jaguar, Nissan, Citroen's DS brand, China's Nio and Monaco-based Venturi.

""Electrification is the big topic within the whole auto industry so to be a credible part of that journey you want to be involved in many different aspects of it,"" said Tucker.

For a company like Shell, keen to highlight an increasing investment in wind power, brand association is only a part of the equation.

Total also emphasises its involvement in solar energy on the Techeetah website.

Formula E, which started its season with races in the world's biggest oil producer Saudi Arabia, presents itself as a vehicle for change as well as an important test laboratory for road car technology.

Tucker emphasised the interest for Shell in developing 'E fluids' from turned into liquid at the company's plant in Qatar.

""If you charge your phone, you know that it gets a little bit warm. If you’re doing that on a big scale, particularly if you want to do it quickly for your car..., then you’ve got to take that heat away from the batteries,"" said Tucker.

""There's lots of variations on the theme but the one that we believe is a winner for the future is so-called immersion cooling, because the batteries are in direct contact with the liquid that is the heat-transfer medium for you.

""So we are developing a range of fluids for immersion or direct cooling.""

The electric motors require greases while lubricants need to show advanced anti-foaming properties because the gearbox is spinning so fast.

Formula E founder Alejandro Agag, who now spends most of his time on a planned new Extreme E series, said the oil companies were welcome.

""It is a big change. Those companies also have the key to make a big change because it’s not people who are in their home watching TV that are going to make the change,"" he told Reuters recently.",https://uk.investing.com//news/general/motor-racing-oil-giants-find-fresh-focus-in-allelectric-formula-e-2033399,0.003,0.89,0.107,0.9945

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) is looking to sell its oil refinery in Anacortes, Washington, according to three people familiar with the matter.

If completed, this and other asset sales currently underway would reduce Shell's North American refining operations to large plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast, said the people, speaking on condition of anonymity as the talks are private.

Oil and gas major Shell has publicly committed to selling more than $5 billion (3.8 billion pounds) of assets per year in 2019 and 2020. The Netherlands-based company is trying to use its global scale to build a power business as the world moves toward cleaner energy.

The refinery, located north of Seattle, has the ability to process 144,000 barrels per day (bpd) of , according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

This is Shell's third effort to divest a plant in the past year. In June, Shell agreed to sell its Martinez, California, refinery to independent refiner PBF Energy Inc (N: ) for up to $1 billion.

The company retained advisers about a year ago to sell its 75,000-bpd Sarnia, Ontario, refinery.

If all three sales are completed, including Anacortes, Shell would operate only three North American refineries: the 340,000-bpd Deer Park, Texas, refinery, a joint venture with Petroleos Mexicanos, and two refineries on the Louisiana coast that together can process almost 500,000 bpd of crude oil.

Shell has also divested refineries in other regions, selling its 50% stake in the SASREF refinery in Saudi Arabia last year.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusive-royal-dutch-shell-seeking-buyer-for-anacortes-washington-refinery--sources-2028124,0.013,0.921,0.066,0.8442

(Reuters) - Underwhelming trading updates from Pearson and Whitbread broke a three-day winning run for London's main index on Thursday, while investors exercised caution amid a lack of clarity on some elements of the U.S.-China trade deal.

The FTSE 100 ( ) drifted in and out of the red but ended 0.4% lower, underperforming the STOXX 600 ( ) which added 0.2%. All but one sector ended the day in negative territory.

The FTSE 250 ( ), however, eked out a 0.04% gain, helped by a strengthening of the pound as well as an 8% leap in Wood Group (L: ) after the oilfield services provider forecast higher 2019 core earnings.

Education company Pearson (L: ) sank 9% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 and hit its lowest level since October 2008 after saying earnings would be lower due to sharp declines in sales at its U.S. higher education business.

Premier Inn-owner Whitbread (L: ) followed with a 5.1% fall after it reported lower UK like-for-like sales and warned that clarity on Brexit following a decisive British election outcome had yet to deliver a bounce in business bookings.

From global headlines, markets digested news that China will boost purchases of U.S. goods and services in exchange for the rolling back of some tariffs under a preliminary trade accord, and were left a bit edgy as the deal does not fully eliminate the tariffs.

""Given that it has taken nearly two years to pick off the low hanging fruit of a Phase 1 deal, it does stand to reason that (any) Phase 2 is likely to take much longer,"" CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said.

""In any case, the tail risk for markets in the short term isn't in the form of further de-escalation, but in the form of the deal falling down and tariffs getting increased again.""

The finer print of the deal states that if the United States is prompted to slap new tariffs which are then disputed by China, the only recourse available would be to quit the agreement rather than lodge an appeal or retaliate.

Companies exposed to international trade relations including oil majors and miners closed in the red on Thursday.

Associated British Foods (L: ) outperformed the FTSE 100, rising 4.1% as solid revenue growth at its Primark fashion chain over Christmas helped it stand by its annual earnings forecast.

A notable faller on the midcap bourse was Dechra Pharmaceuticals (L: ) after the veterinary medicines maker pointed to a softer first-half partly due to supply issues.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell's (L: ) New Energies boss Mark Gainsborough will step down in April and be replaced by Elisabeth Brinton, who joined the business in 2018 and will oversee the company's plans to expand its low-carbon and power business.

Gainsborough, a 39-year Shell veteran, set up Shell's New Energies four years ago as the oil and gas company faces heavy investor pressure to meet the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming.

He will leave the company at the end of the year, he said in a post on his LinkedIn (NYSE: ) page. A Shell spokeswoman confirmed the moves.

Brinton, a Silicon Valley and utility industry veteran, joined Shell in 2018 and is currently vice president for strategy at New Energies, according to her LinkedIn page.

She will take over on April 1.

The Anglo-Dutch company has made a number of large investments in renewables, electric vehicle technologies and power markets under Gainsborough, including acquiring British utility First Utility, European electric vehicle battery charging firm NewMotion and a stake in U.S. solar power provider Silicon Ranch.

Shell plans to invest $2 to $3 billion (2.30 billion pounds) a year on its power and low-carbon business compared with an overall spending budget of $30 billion per year between 2021 and 2025.

The company's growth plans in the sector were dealt a blow last month when it failed to acquire Dutch renewable energy business Eneco which went to a group led by Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp (T: ) for 4.1 billion euros.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shells-new-energies-boss-gainsborough-to-step-down-2027979,0.023,0.913,0.064,0.8442

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (N: ) fourth quarter operating results will decline from a year ago due to weakness in chemicals and refining, according to a regulatory filing and analyst comments on Friday.

Some analysts slashed earnings projections to about 50 cents per share, down from the average earlier estimate of 71 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES. The estimates exclude gains from asset sales.

Exxon on Friday provided its expectations for fourth-quarter results compared with the prior quarter. It will officially report results for the latest quarter on Jan. 31.

The update ""is like Groundhog's day - once again chemicals and downstream weakness will drag down overall earnings,"" said Jennifer Rowland, analyst at Edward Jones.

Exxon in the filing projected a loss in chemicals and a sharply lower operating profit in refining, two of its three major businesses. The company earned about $1 billion per quarter in chemicals as recently as 2017.

Operating profit in its largest business, oil and gas production, could be $2.3 billion (1.7 billion pounds) based on the midpoint of its estimate, up from the third quarter but down from a year ago, according to the filing.

Offsetting the weak results, Exxon will report a gain of as much as $3.6 billion from the sale of its Norwegian oil and gas production, part of a plan to divest about $15 billion in assets by 2021.

""The asset sale proceeds will help cover the dividend, but that's not a sustainable strategy,"" Rowland said.

Exxon did not disclose any asset impairments or write downs in its filing. Since October, rivals Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), Chevron (N: ), BP (L: ), Equinor and Spain's Repsol (MC: ) all wrote down a total more than $20 billion, primarily in U.S. shale gas assets due to lower long-term gas prices.

Cowen & Co cut its quarterly earnings estimate for Exxon to 49 cents per share from 71 cents. Simmons Energy lowered its estimate to 52 cents from 78 cents.

Exxon's refining and chemicals businesses ""remain a material headwind to cash flow"" as there is no sign it will slow spending on new investments, Simmons Energy said in a note to clients.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/exxon-signals-fourth-quarter-weakness-in-chemicals-and-refining-offset-by-asset-sale-2024781,0.059,0.853,0.088,0.9231

(Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 ( ) closed 0.6% lower on Monday with financial stocks leading the losses on concerns over tensions in the Middle East, although oil-fuelled gains for Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) provided some support.

And the FTSE 250 ( ) fell 1% after President Donald Trump threatened sanctions against Iraq and retaliation against Iran if it responded with force to last week's U.S. air strike.

Apart from energy-related shares ( ), which were lifted by oil price gains, all others closed lower.

U.S.-Iran tensions have dampened initial hopes of a sustained rally in global equities on the back of an imminent Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal.

""A severe escalation of tensions in the Middle East - or even outright hostilities - has the potential to easily subsume any benefits gained from the interim U.S.-China trade agreement,"" OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said.

Although BP and Shell had helped the FTSE 100 make gains on Friday, while other markets fell after the air strike, their weighting was not enough to stop the index falling.

""With so much cash heavily invested in global recovery trade in the elusive search for yield, a downward correction in asset prices could be aggressive,"" Halley said.

An index of airlines ( ) recorded its worst two-day fall since early December, as higher oil prices raised concerns about a potential impact on their margins.

Morrisons (L: ) and Sainsbury's (L: ) fell 3.3% and 1.1%, respectively, after Bank of America (NYSE: ) said retailers faced structural challenges, including market share losses to discounters such as Aldi UK, which reported higher sales, and profit dilution due to e-commerce.

Britain's major supermarkets are forecast to report lacklustre Christmas sales this week, reflecting weak economic growth and comparisons with generally solid festive results in 2018.

LONDON (Reuters) - A group of Barclays (L: ) shareholders coordinated by responsible investment lobby group ShareAction want the bank to phase out financing fossil fuels, stepping up pressure on one of Europe's biggest funders of the sector.

Eleven institutional investors have filed a resolution to be voted on at Barclays' annual meeting in May, requiring the bank to set out plans to stop providing all financial services to firms not aligned with the Paris climate agreement.

The pressure on Barclays comes at a time when shareholders, prompted by activists and mounting public concern, are increasingly urging the companies they invest in to do more to combat the climate crisis.

Up to now, investors have largely focused their collective efforts on big oil and gas companies responsible for producing fossil fuels, with resolutions at companies including Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), BP (L: ) and Equinor (OL: ).

The Barclays resolution will mark the first time a European bank has faced such shareholder action on fossil fuel financing. It calls on Barclays to go further than its previous public commitments to combat climate change by forcing it to set specific targets.

The move comes just days after outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the financial services industry had been too slow to cut investment in fossil fuels.

Carney is set to leave the BoE at the end of January to take up a position as the United Nations special envoy for climate action. He has previously warned that global warming could lead to a sharp reassessment of the value of every financial asset.

The eleven investors publicly backing the Barclays resolution collectively manage some 130 billion pounds and include Brunel Pension Partnership, LGPS Central, Sarasin & Partners and Folksam.

""The lending practices of many banks pose a serious threat to the goals of the Paris agreement,"" said Laura Chappell, Chief Executive of Brunel Pension Partnership.

""We hope the Barclays Board formally supports this resolution.""

One of the bank's 20 biggest shareholders told Reuters they could also back the proposals.

""We've said to Barclays we would be minded to support this type of resolution, so you'd better take it seriously,"" the investor said.

A formal vote on the measures at the May meeting might not be needed if the bank announces measures beforehand that satisfy the investors' demands.

""We are working to help tackle climate change, and we meet with ShareAction and other shareholders regularly to update them on our progress,"" a spokesman for Barclays said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/barclays-pressured-by-shareholders-to-cut-fossil-fuel-financing-2026649,0.053,0.854,0.094,0.947

(Reuters) - Britain's stock market indexes surged in the first trading session of the new decade, as investors welcomed China's monetary policy easing and U.S. President Donald Trump set the date for sealing a Phase 1 trade deal with Beijing.

The FTSE 100 ( ) jumped after two straight sessions of losses to rise 0.8% after China cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks and Trump said a Phase 1 trade deal with Beijing would be signed on Jan. 15.

Mining shares ( ) and oil majors were among the top gainers, with Antofagasta (L: ), Glencore (L: ) and BP (L: ) advancing between 2%-3.1%.

The FTSE 250 ( ) soared 1% to notch up a fresh record high and the British indexes enjoyed their best day since mid-December, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson's election win and de-escalating trade tensions had triggered a rally in equities.

Gains were further supported by strong demand for cyclical stocks such as banks, that led blue-chips Lloyds (L: ) and Barclays (LON: ) higher by 2% and 3%, respectively.

But despite Thursday's rise, which came after two sessions of profit-taking following the FTSE 100's best run in three years, analysts warned against getting carried away, citing thin trading volume and calling China's policy predictable.

""The move on the RRR had been well telegraphed but came as a welcome New Year's gift,"" OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said.

Cityindex analyst Ken Odeluga echoed that Beijing's policy decision wasn't surprising, adding that though a signing date for Phase 1 was set, uncertainties remained about if and when more comprehensive trade agreements would be nailed down.

""As much as investors are keen to ring-in the New Year with sure-footed gains, these influences are of course 'so 2019',"" he said.

""Predicating a positive risk-asset rally on them continues to ignore a whole host of well-rehearsed reasons to remain cautious.""

Tullow Oil (L: ), which plummeted more than 70% last month after it scrapped its dividend and its CEO stepped down, plunged as much as 20% following underwhelming results of drilling at its Carapa-1 well offshore Guyana.

(Reuters) - Britain's stock market indexes advanced on Christmas Eve, with the main bourse now on its longest winning streak in three years and the midcaps touching a fresh record high, amid a lack of major drivers in thin trading.

The FTSE 100 ( ) overcame earlier sluggishness to add 0.1% on Tuesday, its 10th straight session of gains. Boosts from oil major Shell (L: ) and a 2% rise in domestic bank Lloyds (L: ) ensured the index clung to a five-month high.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) ended higher for the fourth straight day as it outperformed its European peers with a 0.6% gain.

Dealers seemed content to reflect on major developments of the month, including a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks that partly led to an equities rally earlier this month.

""This holiday period should be rather calm as trade updates appear very constructive as we near the finalisation of the phase-one trade deal next month,"" OANDA analyst Craig Erlam said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's election victory also spurred on domestic stocks, reflecting hopes of a clear path to Brexit.

Some of that optimism waned after his expressed hard line on a future trade agreement with the European Union revived fears of a chaotic Brexit.

Traders are now likely to hold off on making further bets before gaining further clarity on trade and Brexit in the new year.

Sterling recovered from a three-week low against the U.S. dollar, which weighed on exporters such as Unilever (L: ) and limited the main index's rise.

Still, the bourse is on course for its best month since April 2018, while the more domestically-focused midcaps are on track for a fourth consecutive month of gains and their best performance since January.

The FTSE 100 looks set for its biggest annual gain since 2016, when Britain voted in a referendum to leave the EU. The FTSE 250 is on course for its best year in six, as several long-standing hurdles to Brexit have now been removed.

(Reuters) - London's main stock index overturned earlier loses to end higher on Friday as a U.S. air strike in Iraq stoked fears of a disruption in crude supply, supporting shares of oil heavyweights, and as tobacco stocks firmed.

The FTSE 100 ( ) had been pressured for most of the session as rising geopolitical tensions after the air strike, that killed top Iranian and Iraqi commanders, drove investors away from risky assets and towards safe havens such as gold.

(Reuters) - Britain's blue-chip equities index gained for a ninth straight session on Monday in holiday-thinned trading, while midcaps hovered near all-time highs.

The FTSE 100 ( ) rose 0.5% to hit its highest in nearly five months and match its best run of gains since May 2017. The FTSE 250 ( ) jumped 0.8%, up for the third straight session.

Both benchmark indexes drifted lower in early dealings as traders locked in profits ahead of Christmas, but a lack of negative news and paltry trading volumes helped them recover.

""Given the low liquidity conditions, it does not take much to change the market,"" Raymond James analyst Chris Bailey said. ""Note too the lack of real losers. Classic squeeze up just ahead of Christmas.""

The stand-out gainer was NMC Health (L: ), which surged almost 37% on its best day ever after it promised an independent review of its books. Its shares had nearly halved in value last week after short-selling firm Muddy Waters questioned its finances.

""The fact the company is taking such action implies they don't have anything to hide, which has encouraged some traders to swoop in and snap up the relatively cheap stock,"" CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.

Dealers seemed content to reflect on major developments of the month, including a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's election victory which have helped the FTSE 100 surge nearly 5% in the last two weeks.

The exporter-heavy index is on course for its best month since June, while the more domestically-focussed midcaps are on track for a fourth straight month of gains. Both benchmark indexes look set for their ninth month of gains this year.

Some of that momentum has eased after Johnson's hard line on a trade agreement with the European Union revived fears of a chaotic Brexit and market players are likely to hold off on making further bets before the new year.

Lingering Brexit concerns left sterling hamstrung on Monday, boosting firms with a larger international exposure such as Shell (L: ), Unilever (L: ) and Diageo (L: ), which lent further support to the main index.

(Reuters) - London's main index rose for the eleventh straight session on Friday, as trade-sensitive stocks cheered further positive signals from the United States and China over signing a phase-one deal.

The FTSE 100 ( ), which is on its best run in three years, gained 0.2%, supported by a near 2% rise in Glencore (L: ). BP (L: ) was also a major boost to the index and rose 1%, benefiting from higher crude prices.

Returning from their Christmas and Boxing Day break, traders hailed comments from Beijing and Washington that signalled official ratification of an initial trade deal was close.

However, a lack of further details meant that the bourse settled for only a modest gain on the day, while trading volume remained thin at the end of a holiday-shortened week.

The FTSE 250 ( ) added 0.4% to scale a fresh record high and sterling firmed after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the European Union may need to extend the deadline for talks about a new trade relationship with Britain.

Fear of a chaotic Brexit, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson set a hard deadline of Dec. 2020 for a deal, has sapped some momentum from a rally in domestic stocks which was spurred by his landslide election victory earlier this month.

Still, UK markets, in tandem with global peers, are ushering in an upbeat end to the year, as broader worries around major macro-economic events such as the U.S.-China trade war, British politics and Brexit have receded recently.

This has increased investor appetite for risky assets like stocks, with the blue-chip bourse on course for its best month since April 2018 and its best annual performance since 2016.

The more domestically-focused midcaps are on track for best month since January and their biggest yearly gain since 2013.

""A lot of excellent news is now priced into financial markets across the globe, but top picking remains a dangerous game; only for the brave and deep-pocketed,"" OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said.

Food delivery firm Just Eat (L: ) topped the main board with a 2.4% rise after Britain's competition regulator said it would launch an in-depth probe into Amazon's (O: ) deal with online food delivery group Deliveroo.

NMC Health (L: ) fell 2.6%. The healthcare provider's shares more than halved in value last week after short-seller Muddy Waters criticised its financials, but shot up more than 36% on Monday after promising to review its books.

(Reuters) - British shares fell on the year's penultimate trading day as investors consolidated gains from a rally that saw the blue-chip index enjoy its best run in three years and led midcaps to successive record highs.

The FTSE 100 ( ) shed 0.8% after logging 11 straight days of advances. The FTSE 250 ( ) gave up 0.6%, as dealers cleared the decks in another holiday-shortened week and braced for 2020.

Healthcare stocks AstraZeneca (L: ) and GlaxoSmithKline (L: ) were among the biggest drags on the blue-chip bourse. Oil majors Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) also weighed, despite crude prices touching a three-month high.

""The overall picture is one of book squaring and profit-taking...with investors preferring to wait until next week before loading up on the first trades of a new decade,"" OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said.

Receding worries around the U.S.-China trade situation, British politics and Brexit have fuelled sharp gains for UK markets in December.

On Monday, trade hopes were further bolstered when White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said Washington and Beijing would likely sign a Phase 1 deal early next year.

At home, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Dec. 12 election victory and prospects of a clear process towards leaving the European Union on Jan. 31 have spurred risk-on sentiment.

Though Johnson's hard line on a December 2020 deadline for a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the EU blemished an otherwise robust rally, the FTSE 100 is still tracking its best month since June and its biggest annual gain since 2016.

The more domestically focused midcaps are on course for their best month since January and their best yearly performance since 2013.

However, Halley warned against reading too much into year-end moves that have come in thin trading volumes over the Christmas holidays.

""Strong directional moves at this time of the year should always be taken with a grain of salt with so many participants, either away or having closed books for the year-end,"" he said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions on companies building a pipeline to boost Russian gas supplies to Europe will delay the completion of the project by several months and increase its cost, a member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives said on Monday.

The group behind Nord Stream 2 has said it aims to complete the project seeking to double gas capacity along the northern Nord Stream pipeline route to Germany as soon as possible after U.S. sanctions prompted a contractor to suspend pipe-laying.

The United States, which is seeking to sell more of its own liquefied to European states, says Nord Stream 2 will make Europe too reliant on Russian supplies.

""The sanctions will temporarily delay completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,"" conservative lawmaker Peter Beyer told German public radio. ""But I believe that in the second half of next year the pipeline will be completed.""

The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will run along the Baltic Sea floor, was expected to start up in the first half of 2020.

""There are alternatives, which will bring with them delays as well as higher costs,"" said Beyer.

Merkel has condemned the decision but said her government would not retaliate against Trump's sanctions.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Sunday that the pipeline would be launched despite U.S. sanctions and that Russia would respond.

Gazprom (MM: ), Russia's state-controlled gas giant and a major backer of Nord Stream 2, already supplies more than a third of Europe's gas needs.

Nord Stream 2 will help Russia bypass Ukraine, the main route for Russian gas. The two neighbouring countries, which are locked in military conflict that followed Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, agreed a new transit deal this week.

Nord Stream 2 contractor, Swiss-Dutch company Allseas, announced on Friday it had suspended pipe-laying activities.

Other partners in Nord Stream 2 are Austria's OMV (VI: ), the German firms Uniper (DE: ) and Wintershall (DE: ), Anglo-Dutch energy major Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and France's Engie (PA: ).",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/us-sanctions-will-delay-raise-costs-of-nord-stream-two-pipeline-german-conservative-2020215,0.039,0.912,0.049,0.25

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese marine fuel suppliers have signed up short-term deals to buy very low-sulphur fuel oil from companies like oil major Shell (L: ), Germany's Uniper (DE: ) and U.S. commodities trader Freepoint ahead of a new standard on emissions for the global shipping industry that kicks in on Jan. 1.

While China's state refiners have pledged to produce a combined 14 million tonnes of the fuel for 2020 that complies with the tighter rules set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Beijing has not yet rolled out much-anticipated tax breaks that will encourage refineries to ramp up domestic output of the very low-sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO).

Instead, companies like Chimbusco, PetroChina (HK: ) and Sinopec Corp (HK: ) have procured supplies from the international market to cover demand up to the end-March, executives at the three firms said. The officials declined to be named as they're not authorised to speak to media.

The buying pattern comes as the world's shipping business gets set to go greener to comply with IMO rules: From Jan. 1, they'll be obliged to run ship engines using VLSFO or marine gasoil (MGO) of 0.5% sulphur content, down from the current 3.5%.

""China continues to buy the (low-sulphur) fuel in bulk from Singapore as local tax legislation deters Chinese refiners from selling into the bunker (shipping) fuel market,"" consultancy Energy Aspects said in a note this week.

Beijing has been widely expected to announce by end-2019 a waiver of a 1,218 yuan ($177.11) per tonne consumption tax and offer rebates of the 13% value-added tax currently levied on fuel oil to allow the country's refiners to economically produce VLSFO.

The Chinese companies are importing 500,000-700,000 tonnes of VLSFO per month on average from November to January, diverting limited supplies from Singapore, the world's top bunkering hub, three Singapore-based traders said.

PetroChina has secured close to 1 million tonnes of 0.5% sulphur content fuel oil from Dubai-based Uniper Energy, a united of Germany's Uniper, and U.S. trader Freepoint, while Chimbusco has also bought from companies including Shell (L: ) to cover several months' sales.

""Our refineries are ready to pump the (low-sulphur) fuel once the (Beijing) tax policy comes through,"" said a PetroChina executive, who declined to be identified by name. ""Meanwhile, we've secured supplies that could last as long as through April or May in case the policy is being delayed.""

PetroChina will stock up both in Singapore, where it owns storage, and Zhoushan in east China, China's largest bunkering centre, the PetroChina official added.

Sinopec, Asia's top refiner, appeared more relaxed and has built the smallest inventory compared to Chimbusco and PetroChina, according to comments from officials at the three firms.

Soaring demand - including from China - and logistical constraints for VLSFO ahead of the Jan. 1 deadline has pushed prompt-delivery VLSFO bunkers to as high as $30-$40 per tonne above MGO prices in Singapore, versus a $20-$30 per tonne discount just weeks ago.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/china-firms-stock-up-cleaner-shipping-fuel-overseas-ahead-of-new-emission-rules-2019184,0.009,0.93,0.061,0.9758

(Bloomberg) -- Royal Dutch Shell (AS: ) expects capital expenditure to be near the lower end of the $24 billion to $29 billion range in 2019, as the company keeps a lid on spending amid concern about its ability to sustain hefty shareholder returns.

The statement on fourth-quarter earnings published on Friday comes after Shell’s previous set of bumper profits was overshadowed by a warning about the pace of share buybacks. It’s only the second time the company has issued such guidance, which was a response to criticism about the unpredictability of its financial results.

Shell also indicated that post-tax impairment charges in the final three months of the year would be between $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion, based on the macroeconomic outlook. These so-called “identified items” totaled $1.3 billion in the third quarter.

Last week, Chevron Corp (NYSE: ) said it expects to write down as much as $11 billion for assets including shale-gas holdings in the U.S. prices in the country are on course for the lowest annual average in two decades, forcing producers to consider revaluing what many of the fields are worth.

Shell warned in October that the worsening economy could slow the pace of returns to shareholders, prompting a negative reaction from investors despite the company comfortably beating even the highest analyst profit estimate for the third quarter. Friday’s statement also gave a relatively downbeat assessment of the market.

“Trading and optimization performance is expected to be average” in the company’s integrated gas unit, according to the statement. In the marketing business “margins are expected to be lower due to seasonal trends, and weaker compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to crude price movements.”

The company’s B shares slipped 0.7% to 2,257 pence as of 8:14 a.m. in London.

Upstream production will range from 2.775 million to 2.825 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the fourth quarter, Shell said. Integrated gas output will be between 920,000 and 970,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, with gas-liquefaction volumes of 8.8 million to 9.4 million tons.

Investing.com -- President Donald Trump wants to be tried immediately, but stocks are ignoring the impeachment noise and are consolidating at new record highs anyway. The U.K. House of Commons will - finally - vote through legislation on leaving the European Union, and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) warns of as much as $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Plus there's the final reading of U.S. third-quarter gross domestic product. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 20th December.

1. Brexit bill to pass, as U.K. appoints Bailey as next BoE head

After multiple rejections, the U.K. House of Commons will in all probability finally approve legislation governing the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union.

The Withdrawal Agreement bill has been redrafted by Boris Johnson’s government to expunge previous references it made to protecting workers’ rights, a compromise it had made when it still needed the votes of Labour Party MPs to pass. The bill must still pass the House of Lords and receive Royal Assent before entering into law.

Elsewhere, the government also approved Andrew Bailey to take over from Mark Carney as Governor of the Bank of England in March next year. Bailey is a BOE lifer who currently heads the Financial Conduct Authority and who in the past has also been the institution’s chief banking supervisor.

2. Trump wants a trial now

President Donald Trump called for “an immediate trial” after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to say when she would send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, the next administrative step that must happen before the upper house votes on whether to remove Trump from office.

Any delay to the trial, which was notionally slated for January, would be intended to give Congressional Democrats time to put pressure on the Republican-controlled Senate to allow for witnesses such as National Security Advisor John Bolton to be called. So far, that pressure does not look like it is likely to succeed.

3. Stocks consolidating at new highs

U.S. stocks are set to open mixed after closing at new record highs again on Thursday.

By 6:35 AM ET (1135 GMT), were up 17 points, less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 futures contract and the contract were up in parallel.

Treasury bond yields, meanwhile, continue to grind higher, with the 10-year note yield hitting 1.95% and the 30-year bond hitting 2.37%. The yield curve inversion that so troubled investors earlier in the year has been banished as three interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have eased fears of a recession.

The earnings calendar is winding down ahead of the holiday period, with the only report of note due.

4. Final Q3 GDP reading due

There’s a last hurrah for data ahead of the holiday season, with a final reading for third-quarter U.S. GDP due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). The previous revision put the annualized growth rate at 2.1% any last adjustments are likely to be minimal.

Even so, attention will be paid to sub-components such as real consumer spending and the price index for personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s favored measure of inflation. The latter is expected at 2.3% for the third quarter, while more up to date figures for November will be published at 10 AM ET

There’s also a final revision of the Michigan consumer sentiment due at 10 AM and the Kansas City Fed regional business survey at 11 AM ET.

5. Shell (LON: ) warns of big write-downs

A week after Chevron Corp (NYSE: ) announced writedowns of over $10 billion on its oil and gas portfolio, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) said it faces impairments of as much as $2.3 billion in the current quarter due to decommissioning costs, well write-offs and other factors.

However, Europe’s largest major also said its oil output will be at the top of its previously forecast range, while capital spending for the year will be at the bottom end of the guidance range at just over $24 billion.

(Reuters) - London's main index rose on Friday and was on course to record its longest winning streak in more than two-and-a-half years, as shares of exporters benefited from a subdued pound amid renewed no-deal Brexit worries.

The FTSE 100 ( ) inched 0.2% higher, tracking its best run of consecutive gains since May 2017. The FTSE 250 ( ) was flat at 0835 GMT as trading began to wind down ahead of the holiday season.

After a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks and Prime Minister Boris Johnson winning the British elections, investor focus now shifts to his vote on a divorce deal with European Union.

The euphoria around Johnson's win had triggered a rally in domestically-exposed stocks, though fears of a chaotic Brexit have re-emerged due to a new provision for a hard, December 2020 deadline to reach a trade agreement with the European Union.

However, sterling traded near two-week lows as traders expect the deal to be ratified without any major hiccups, helping exporter stocks such as Diageo (L: ) and Reckitt Benckiser (L: ).

Despite swinging between sharp gains and losses this week, the midcaps, whose components earn most of their money at home, are still set for an eighth successive weekly jump.

Shell (L: ) dipped nearly 1% after it forecast $2.3 billion in impairment charges for its latest quarter and trimmed its oil production sales outlook.

Shares of Just Eat (L: ) fell 2%, a day after Dutch firms Prosus NV (AS: ) and Takeaway.com (AS: ) tabled their final offers for the company. Takeaway.com looks poised to win approval to buy the British online food delivery group.

By Ron Bousso

LONDON (Reuters) - An activist group is increasing the pressure on five big U.S. and European oil companies with shareholder resolutions urging them to meet the Paris climate goals and cut carbon emissions.

Dutch group Follow This is targeting U.S. giants ExxonMobil (N: ), Chevron (N: ) and their European rivals Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), BP (L: ) and Equinor (OL: ) with climate resolutions ahead of next year's annual general meetings (AGMs) scheduled for the first half of 2020.

Follow This owns minor stakes in the companies which enables it to file shareholder resolutions.

The Exxon and Chevron resolutions are vaguer than the European text, underscoring an Atlantic divide over companies' approach to climate change.

The U.S. version calls on the Exxon and Chevron boards to ""align its strategy with emission levels compatible with the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement"", which aims to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.

The European companies, which all agreed in recent years on various emission reduction targets, are however urged to set and publish clear long-term targets to meet the Paris goals.

The resolutions urge all companies to include all types of emissions in their climate strategies, including those from fuels and products sold to customers, known as Scope 3 emissions, which are 6 to 8 times bigger than emissions from the companies' operations.

Follow This first filed a climate resolution with Shell in 2016 but last year it expanded its efforts to other companies as the climate debate gathered momentum.

Its resolutions have always been opposed by the companies' boards and have never won a majority support, but they have often led to debates during annual meetings.

It is still unclear if the U.S. resolutions will be put to vote as companies are allowed to request regulators to bar shareholder resolutions.

Exxon last year successfully blocked a resolution by the Church Commissioners for England and the New York State comptroller's office.

Follow This also renewed pressure on Shell with a call to set out clear short, medium and long-term targets for greenhouse gas emission targets.

Last year the group did not file a resolution with the Anglo-Dutch company after it had agreed in 2017 together with a large group of investors on a long-term ambition to halve its emission intensity by 2050.

Shell confirmed a resolution has been filed and it is being reviewed. BP declined to comment. Equinor did not reply to requests for comment.

Chevron confirmed the resolution was filed. A spokesman for the company said it was ""too early to comment directly on stockholder proposals,"" adding that the company had established goals to reduce emission intensity in its upstream operations.

Exxon did not comment on the Follow This resolution but said that ""all shareholder proposals will go through the proper process in advance of the annual meeting.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exxon-chevron-face-new-round-of-shareholder-climate-resolutions-2015545,0.034,0.938,0.028,-0.4559

(Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) said on Friday it expects impairment charges of up to $2.3 billion (£1.76 billion) in the fourth quarter and trimmed its forecast for quarterly oil product sales, as the Anglo-Dutch oil company faces slowing demand for oil and gas.

The company warned in October that trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's two largest energy consumers, could hurt demand and take a toll on its performance.

Shell said it expects oil product sales of 6.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) to 7 million boepd for the fourth quarter, compared with its earlier estimate of 6.65 million boepd to 7.05 million boepd.

The company, which had beaten third-quarter profit expectations on strong oil and gas trading, also warned that higher taxes would hit earnings by about $500 million to $600 million in the fourth quarter.

Post-tax impairment charges are expected to range between$1.7 billion and $2.3 billion for the quarter, Shell said.

The company added that it expects additional well write-offs in the range of $100 million to $200 million in the period, while 2019 capital expenditure is expected to be at the lower end of its guidance range of $24 billion to $29 billion.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The captain of a Vietnamese oil tanker has been jailed for over five years in Singapore for his role in a scheme that saw around $150 million (115 million pounds) of oil stolen from Shell's biggest refinery over several years.

Doan Xuan Than, 47, was sentenced to 66 months in prison on Thursday, a spokesman for the State Courts of Singapore said, becoming the second person jailed in a case that also involves former employees of Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) who allegedly conspired to siphon oil from the firm's Singapore refinery.

The theft, which unfolded in the world's biggest ship refuelling hub and Southeast Asia's petroleum refining hub, shone a spotlight on an illegal oil trade worth tens of billions of dollars worldwide. https://reut.rs/34ArdP6

Than's sentencing comes almost two years after Singaporean police raids that led to over a dozen arrests for alleged offences dating back to 2014 in which around 340,000 tonnes of oil were filched from Shell's refinery, which sits on an islet south of Singapore's mainland.

Charge sheets seen by Reuters allege that Than was involved in the theft of gasoil from the Pulau Bukom refinery aboard vessels MT Gaea and Prime Sun on 10 occasions in 2016 and 2017. Than could not be reached for comment.

Another Vietnamese national was jailed for 2-1/2-years in July for related offences, local newspaper Straits Times reported.

Besides the former Shell employees, there have been related charges filed against former employees of one of Singapore's biggest marine fuel suppliers, Sentek Marine & Trading Pte Ltd; a Singaporean who worked for Intertek (L: ), a British-listed company specializing in quality and quantity assurance, including for fuel products; and other Vietnamese nationals who allegedly helped receive stolen property aboard ships.

Shell has previously said it was ""disappointed"" by what it uncovered at Pulau Bukom, was working closely with authorities and had implemented ""measures to prevent this from happening again"".",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/singapore-jails-tanker-captain-in-shell-oil-heist-case--reports-2019109,0.1,0.879,0.021,-0.9819

(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco (SE: ) shares surged as the oil producer began trading after its initial public offering, vaulting Saudi Arabia’s stock market into the ranks of the world’s largest.

The stock jumped the daily 10% limit to 35.20 riyals at 10:31 a.m. in Riyadh. Trading kicked off after an opening auction from 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. local time.

Aramco raised $25.6 billion in the biggest-ever IPO, selling shares at 32 riyals each and valuing the company at $1.7 trillion, overtaking Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). as the most valuable listed company. Saudi officials have pulled out all the stops to ensure that the stock trades higher.

“It’s likely that we will see Aramco bid up to $2 trillion or higher in the first days of trading, and potentially to trade limit up on the first day,” said Zachary Cefaratti, chief executive officer at Dalma Capital Management Ltd., which bought shares in the IPO through three funds.

The start of trading in Riyadh marks the end of a near four-year saga that’s been intertwined with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s rise to global prominence and his Vision 2030 plan to reform the Saudi economy. First announced in an interview with Economist in January 2016, the IPO set records, but fell short of the $100 billion international offering with a valuation of $2 trillion that the prince once proposed.

Even before any first-day pop, Aramco is so big that it easily dwarfs the rest of the companies in the Saudi market, which have a combined value of about $500 billion. Adding in Aramco, the kingdom’s bourse becomes the world’s ninth-biggest stock market, overtaking India and closing in on Germany and Canada. Saudi Arabia, though, only sold 1.5% of the company’s capital, meaning that barely any of its shares will trade.

Foreign investors balked at the prince’s sought-for valuation, citing concerns including governance issues and possible security threats to stay away from the stock. Still, final orders surpassed $119 billion, with authorities allowing lenders to boost loans beyond usual to support the sale.

“There are a lot of transparency issues in the disclosures and based on the expected listing valuation, it doesn’t seem one is getting paid for that uncertainty or opacity,” said Adam Choppin, an investment officer at FIS Group in Philadelphia, who decided not to buy shares. “Reportedly, it seems that a good amount of local investors have been cajoled into participating, whereas no such leverage exists over foreign investors.”

Aramco’s IPO was said to have relied on some of the kingdom’s richest families, who had members detained in a hotel during a so-called crackdown on corruption in 2017, and also on cash from neighboring allies such as the sovereign wealth funds of Kuwait and Abu Dhabi. Gulf Cooperation Council investors are confident the stock price has plenty of room to increase, boosted by incentives that go from bonus shares to fast inclusion in emerging-market benchmarks.

A surge in early trading validates “our thesis that Aramco’s pricing fell short of $2 trillion to leave upside on the table for Saudi and GCC investors, allowing them to benefit from the listing of Saudi’s crown jewel,” said Dalma Capital’s Cefaratti.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: )., acting as share stabilizing manager, has the right to exercise an option to sell another 450 million shares. It could be executed in whole or in part up to 30 calendar days after trading begins. The previous largest IPO, Alibaba (NYSE: ) Group Holding Ltd., rose 38% in its trading debut in 2014.

The Aramco IPO proceeds will be transferred to the Public Investment Fund, which has made a number of bold investments, including into SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund and a $3.5 billion stake in Uber Technologies (NYSE: ) Inc. Saudi authorities flagged this week that “a lot” of the money will be spent in the domestic economy.

Giant in the Room

The proceeds of the Aramco deal alone are equal to more than a decade of IPOs on Tadawul, the Saudi stock exchange, which has already said that the company’s weighting in the main local benchmark will be capped at 15%. And even though Aramco’s free float is among the lowest globally, the deal opens up one of the world’s most secretive companies, one that bankrolled Saudi Arabia and its rulers for decades, but until this year had never published financial statements or borrowed in international debt markets.

Aramco has promised a bumper dividend payment of a minimum $75 billion a year until at least 2024. That could make yields competitive with the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, but also threatens to stretch the world’s largest oil producer if prices fall.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/aramco-soars-in-debut-to-hit-market-value-of-188-trillion-2012937,0.03,0.856,0.114,0.9973

QUITO (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), Mitsubishi Corp (T: ) and Trafigura presented bids for a contract to lift some 20.2 million barrels of Ecuadorean crude between 2020 and 2023, the Andean country's energy minister told reporters on Tuesday.

The country expects to pick a winner for the contract, which is expected to generate $950 million (£740.45 million) in export income for Ecuador, in the coming days, said the minister, Jose Agusto.

Ecuador invited some 51 companies to participate in the auction, the first of its kind in more than a decade. The price of the oil will be determined by a formula taking into account the price of the country's oil sales on the spot market plus a premium.

Shell, through its Shell Western Supply and Trading Unit, proposed the highest premium, according to state oil company Petroecuador.

Under the contract, Ecuador will deliver the winner four shipments of 360,000 barrels each of Oriente-grade crude in 2020 and 2021. In 2022 and 2023, the country will deliver the winner 24 shipments of the same amount per year.

ZURICH (Reuters) - ABB (S: ) is ready to spin off more businesses although a separation of its electrification unit is not on the table, Chairman and interim Chief Executive Peter Voser said in an article published on Wednesday.

The Swiss engineering company, under pressure from activist investors to simplify its operations, is carrying out a strategic review of underperforming businesses and agreed to sell its power grids business last year.

Voser, the former Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) CEO who took temporary charge at ABB in April, said the company, whose operations run from factory robots to chargers for electric cars, was ready to make further cuts to its portfolio if necessary.

""If we feel the need to separate ourselves from one area, then we do that as well,"" Voser said in article published by German newspaper Boersen-Zeitung.

""If we see a strategic need, we can act,"" he said. ""I can not say if ABB will look like it does now in five years.""

The comments, confirmed by ABB, boosted the company's shares, which were 2.5% higher and the biggest gainer on Switzerland's blue chip index. ( )

The synergies between the ABB's electrification, industrial automation, drive technology and robotics divisions ""are not so great,"" Voser said in the article.

But he added that a separation of the electrification division, currently ABB's biggest business by sales, was not being considered.

A separation is ""not at the moment on the table with us,"" said Voser.

Voser is due to be replaced by Sandvik CEO (ST: ) Bjorn Rosengren in February, and will return to his role as chairman.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/abb-ceo-says-more-spinoffs-possible-2008927,0.011,0.955,0.034,0.6059

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 dropped to a two-month low on its fourth day in the red on Tuesday, as U.S. President Donald Trump's nonchalance about reaching a trade deal with China spooked traders.

The blue-chip index ( ) slipped 1.8%, while the midcap FTSE 250 index's ( ) fall was limited to 1% on the back of a 15% surge in miner Centamin (L: ) after Canada's Endeavour Mining (TO: ) revealed a $1.9 billion buyout proposal.

Diversified miner Glencore (L: ) was among steepest fallers on the main board, tumbling 4% as investors were unimpressed by an update on the company's priorities and expected output.

In a broad sell-off, every sector in the main index recorded losses after Trump said an agreement with Beijing might have to wait until after the U.S. presidential election in November 2020.

Asia-facing financial stocks, led by a 2.3% drop in HSBC (L: ), and oil majors Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) were among those hardest hit due to the trade jitters.

""This insouciance about the prospect of putting off any deal has completely upended market expectations that we were potentially millimetres away from a deal, and also flies in the face of the optimism that has seen markets rally strongly over the last few weeks,"" CMC analyst Michael Hewson said.

The mood had already started to sour this week as Washington's tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from key Latin American trading partners and Trump's threat to slap separate tariffs on France and the European Union rekindled fears of global trade tensions.

Reflecting that, the FTSE 100 is headed for its worst monthly performance since August despite being just days into the final month of the year.

On Tuesday, the bourse also underperformed its European counterparts, with its dollar-earners falling further due to a rise in sterling after a new poll showed the Conservative Party widening its lead before an election next week.

Among midcaps, Centamin shares marked their biggest one-day climb in four-and-a-half years even as the British firm rejected Endeavour's takeover approach.

""We believe the Endeavour all-share merger proposal for Centamin would provide the management and operational direction Centamin has lacked for the past two years,"" Peel Hunt analysts wrote.

In other news-driven moves, Cineworld (L: ) lost 4% after the cinema chain warned on its annual trading performance.

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 bounced on Monday after a near 1% drop in the previous session, as upbeat manufacturing activity from China - the world's second-largest economy - boosted sentiment, while fashion retailer Ted Baker (L: ) slid on overstated inventory.

The FTSE 100 ( ) advanced 0.5% by 0945 GMT. An index of miners ( ) surged 1.6%, while oil majors Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) added more than 1% each.

The gains owed much to surveys of China's factory activity, which beat forecasts with one showing the quickest pace of expansion in almost three years in November.

Exporter stocks, including Durex condom maker Reckitt Benckiser (L: ), firmed as the pound began the week on the back foot after polls showed a tightening UK election race.

A clutch of polls showed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party losing some of its lead ahead of the Dec. 12 election, adding uncertainty.

The polls tempered investor sentiment at home, leaving the mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) with modest gains of 0.2%. The index had leapt almost 4% last month on hopes of a Tory victory that would clear the way for Brexit.

Ted Baker slipped as much as 10% to its lowest level since March 2009 after the retailer said it may have overstated inventory by as much as 25 million pounds ($32.08 million).

DATA COOLS TRADE FEARS

The latest data out of China set the tone for currency markets, and came as a relief to markets that are cautious of the impact any fallout from Beijing's trade war with Washington will have on the global economy.

Sticking points still remain in trade negotiations. According to news website Axios on Sunday, a trade deal between the United States and China was now ""stalled because of Hong Kong legislation"".

China's Global Times newspaper also reported last night that Beijing's top priority in a preliminary deal was the removal of existing tariffs.

""It is hard to see the U.S. swallowing a very bitter trade pill like that ... It is now becoming more apparent why the talks have dragged on so long,"" OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said.

Online grocer and technology company Ocado (L: ) missed out on the main index's rally, as it shed almost 6% after launching a bond issue, partly to fund construction of robotic warehouses for overseas partners.

Precious metals miner Fresnillo (L: ) also underperformed, hit by a double whammy of lower gold prices amid demand for risky assets and after narrowing its annual production forecast range.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors cheered Spanish group Repsol's (MC: ) pledge to slash net carbon emissions to zero by mid-century, saying they hope it will pile pressure on rival oil and gas companies to follow suit in the fight against climate change.

The world's top oil and gas companies are under heavy pressure, not only from environmental groups but also from institutional investors, to fall in line with targets set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming.

Repsol on Monday became the first leading energy firm to commit to a net-zero emission target, outdoing Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) that had set out an ambition to halve emissions by 2050.

""It is clear that this is a very significant commitment from Repsol that raises the bar across the oil and gas sector,"" said Adam Matthews, Director for Ethics and Engagement at the Church of England Pensions Board, who co-led discussion between a major group of investors with Shell on a climate resolution last year.

Several companies set short-term targets to reduce emissions by limiting gas leaks and burning of excess gas, but none have set out long-term reduction targets before Repsol.

""We have been pressing fossil fuel companies to commit to align with a net zero emissions pathway by 2050 for some time. It is good to see Repsol showing this leadership, including clear milestones along the way,"" said Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship, Sarasin & Partners.

""In the end, shareholders need to know their companies are looking forward, not back, when it comes to the energy transition."" Sarasin & Partners manages 14.3 billion pounds in assets.

CARBON STORAGE

Repsol's targets encompass 95% of all its emissions, including from fuels sold to clients. It also wrote down 4.8 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in the value of its oil and gas assets to reflect its lower oil and gas price outlook.

Net-zero targets are generally expected to be achieved by offsetting emissions through investments in carbon storage technology or in natural sinks such as forests.

Companies are also increasing production of , the least polluting fossil fuel, as well as renewable power such as solar and wind, whose consumption is expected to

jump in coming decades as demand for electricity grows.

Repsol said it would sharply increase its low-carbon power generation capacity by 2030, partly by expanding its renewables business.

(Bloomberg) -- Almost four years after Mohammed bin Salman first said Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant was worth $2 trillion, the crown prince finally proved his point on Thursday.

On the second day of trading on Riyadh’s stock exchange, Saudi Aramco (SE: ) surged -- briefly -- past his target. The valuation had become a matter of pride for Prince Mohammed, and he’s likely to claim victory over skeptical international investors who said the fair value for the world’s largest company is far lower.

“I know he is proud,” his half-brother and oil minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said in a TV interview after the shares were successfully allocated last week. “He made us all proud because he took good decisions. These decisions, you have seen it now, have brought us a 4.6 times over-subscription.”

When the international sales effort was ditched back in November, the crown prince, advised by Prince Abdulaziz and Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan, decided to press on without the global fund management industry and use local capital to get as close to $2 trillion as possible.

Reaching that mark took a major effort. Even before the international part of the share sale was all but abandoned, Aramco promised bumper dividends, minority shareholders were guaranteed payments at the state’s expense, and the company’s tax rates had been cut three times. The measures aimed at enhancing Aramco’s appeal, but as crude fluctuates, they may also undermine the stability of the oil revenues buttressing the kingdom’s economy.

Banks were told to relax lending limits to maximize subscriptions, the richest Saudi families were pressed to make large commitments, retail investors got bonus shares, the governments of neighboring allies Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates were asked to help, and the Saudi state even committed more than $2 billion of its own money.

Potential Trouble

The strategy worked, but it stores up potential trouble. Loans backed by Aramco shares are vulnerable to a drop in the share price, and the heavy reliance on local investors means the offering sucked up capital that could have found its way to other parts of the Saudi economy.

It also makes an international listing, a big part of the original plan, more difficult. Global investors already had a chance to invest in Aramco shares at 32 riyals and balked. There’s no reason to think they would change their minds given another opportunity to invest at a still higher valuation on a different exchange.

Aramco shares also look overvalued compared with other securities. At a market capitalization of $2 trillion, the dividend yield on Aramco shares is just 3.75%, based on the $75 billion a year in dividends the company has promised investors. That’s the same as the yield on Aramco’s bonds due in 2049 -- which entail less capital risk for investors -- and below the yield on long-dated Saudi government bonds.

It’s also a long way below what other large oil companies pay: Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ).’s dividend yield is currently 5.1%, and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc pays 6.8%. Even some Saudi companies provide better yields. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal’s Kingdom Holding Co. yields 6.8%, and Saudi Basic Industries Corp., which Aramco is acquiring, pays 4.9%.

“For investors who have benefited so far, we would take profit here,” analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein Co. including Neil Beveridge and Oswald Clint said in a note on Thursday. “For those who have not, we would wait until a better entry point, which will inevitably come.”",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/prince-gets-his-2-trillion-aramco-but-victory-comes-at-a-cost-2014188,0.066,0.785,0.149,0.9953

Investing.com -- It’s been a tough week for the oil and gas sector.

The price of its main commodity has risen by over $2 - nearly 4% - as the cartel that produces over 40% of the world’s output has moved toward a significant tightening of its policy, but the share prices of Europe’s big names are mostly down on the week, reflecting a growing number of longer-term concerns. The big four European majors are all down on the week, by between 0.6% and 2.6%.

For one thing, there’s the worry about whether the action agreed by OPEC and allies led by Russia will actually be enough to stop a fresh glut on world markets next year. The ‘OPEC+’ grouping has reportedly agreed to take another 500,000 barrels a day of oil off the market through the end of 2020, but whether that will be enough to offset rising production in Brazil, Norway and – the big wild card – U.S. shale is far from clear - especially if the U.S.'s attritional trade war with China continues to depress world oil demand.

London-listed BP (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) can at least argue that some of their weakness is due to exchange rate effects: the pound has rallied strongly this week, reducing the value of their dollar-based income streams. But that doesn’t explain away Total’s and Eni’s limp performance.

The truth is – the OPEC meeting in Vienna is not the only game in town. Across the continent in Madrid, the UN-sponsored COP 25 talks on climate change have sharpened the focus on the growing hostility to the very notion of oil and gas, even though there is currently no way of maintaining living standards in a world without the two sources that meet the overwhelming majority of the world’s primary energy needs.

The sector has been under siege from the growing might of the sustainable investing lobby for years, and now the authorities appear to be taking the ESG side too: incoming European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has pledged to make the continent carbon-neutral by 2050, and Christine Lagarde is likely to throw the European Central Bank's considerable influence behind that push when she launches her strategic review of ECB policy, probably at her first governing council meeting next week.

The ECB's action could include, for example, banning the sector’s bonds from its asset purchase programs. It could also, as bank supervisor, apply higher capital charges on loans to the sector (ironically so, given that the majors in particular have rock-solid credit ratings). The central bank could also pull its own pension money from the sector’s bonds and stocks. All three measures would raise the majors’ cost of capital, the first two especially.

(Bloomberg) -- The chairman of the world’s biggest oil company was about to lose his temper.At a meeting in Riyadh on a sultry October evening, Achintya Mangla, one of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: ).’s most senior bankers, had told Yasir Al-Rumayyan there was no way international investors were going to value Saudi Aramco (SE: ) -- just weeks away from an initial public offering -- at $2 trillion.Al-Rumayyan, who’d risen in just a few years from head of a mid-sized investment bank in Riyadh to one of the most powerful jobs in the global economy, erupted. He unleashed a torrent of expletives in Arabic and English that shocked the roomful of battle-hardened bankers. The chairman was probably worried about telling his boss, the crown prince who locked up many of the nation’s wealthiest people in a five-star hotel just two years ago.In the three and a half years since Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman first proposed an initial public offering of Aramco, the state oil company that pumps 10% of the world’s oil, the $2 trillion valuation had caused trouble.

The prince, who runs the day-to-day affairs of the kingdom, had long insisted on the stratospheric valuation, almost double any other business on the planet, and nobody had been able to convince him global investors didn’t agree. Anyone who argued with him got pushed aside, including Khalid Al-Falih, sacked as Aramco chairman and oil minister earlier this year.

This account is based on interviews with bankers, consultants, executives, government officials and members of the royal family, many of whom asked not to be identified discussing private meetings and conversations. Aramco, the banks and fund managers all declined to comment.

When bankers pitched for a role on the IPO this year, they told Al-Rumayyan what he needed to hear: that $2 trillion wasn’t out of the question. The range initially pitched by Wall Street was $1.7 trillion to $2.4 trillion, according to people involved in the process.But as the sale came closer, the valuation was becoming unsustainable. In September and early October, Aramco’s bankers toured the world informally pitching the deal to fund managers from Boston to London to Tokyo. Everywhere, foreign investors told the company the valuation was too high. In Switzerland, where trillions are managed for the world’s richest people, fund manager Pictet & Cie. had an initial valuation as low as $800 billion.The bankers took notes. A spreadsheet summarizing feedback, seen by Bloomberg News, is a who’s who of the global fund industry, from Capital Group, a large investor in natural resources, to BlackRock (NYSE: ), the biggest fund manager. The consensus from foreign investors was around a valuation of around $1.2 trillion. A few signaled they could go a bit higher. “Up to $1.5 trillion based on dividend,” was the feedback from Franklin Templeton, the emerging markets specialist and among the most generous.The problem for many investors was summarized in two words: dividend yield. At $2 trillion, Aramco would pay shareholders a dividend equivalent to a return of less than 4% on their money, well below what Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: )., Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ) and other major oil companies pay.

Investors need a much higher yield, requiring a lower valuation. Wellington Asset Management, which controls $1 trillion in assets, told bankers the dividend yield needed to rise to 7% to 8% to make the company a worthwhile investment, implying a valuation of about $900 billion.The job of JPMorgan’s Mangla that evening in October was to break the news to the client. Speaking on behalf of the band of banks hired for the deal, he burst the $2 trillion bubble, according to two people who attended the meeting.

Mangla wasn’t the only one who tried to give Al-Rumayyan an unvarnished version of events. Jonathan Penkin, a senior equity capital markets banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: )., was told not to speak at any more meetings after he tried to talk about the valuation later in October, according to people familiar with the discussions. Motassim Al-Ma’Ashouq, the top Aramco executive in charge of the IPO preparations, and the person who had met foreign investors in preparatory talks, was also sidelined.

“Saudi Arabia has always had this problem: top-down decision making,” said Karen Young, a Middle East specialist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a specialist in the political economy of the Middle East. “There’s a culture of fear. Savvy and able technocrats don’t feel comfortable speaking up.”​

Saudi Arabia also drew a blank with strategic investors, which often agree to buy into an IPO earlier than others, becoming cornerstone shareholders on the deal. Aramco’s banks pitched from China to Singapore, Russia to Malaysia. Everywhere, they got a polite thanks, but no thanks.

Al-Rumayyan, 49, who had no experience of the oil and gas industry before becoming Aramco chairman, felt betrayed by the very same Wall Street bankers who had told him that securing a $2 trillion IPO was possible. Saudi Arabia had a tough choice -- go ahead, lose face and settle for a valuation below $1.5 trillion and attract foreign investors. Or delay the deal, perhaps forever.

Riyadh, keen to restore the kingdom’s standing after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, opted for a third way: ignore foreign investors, and sell the Aramco shares at home. The government would pressure wealthy local families, many of whom had members locked up in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton in 2017, and bring in a few friends in the Middle East region, including funds controlled by the governments of the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. Even then, it had to compromise on the valuation, settling for $1.7 trillion.

The new IPO is a shadow of the initial plan, but still allows the crown prince to claim victory. Last Thursday, Aramco announced it raised a record $25.6 billion, beating the $25 billion set by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE: ) Group. The valuation means the world’s most valuable company, until now Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., will trade in Riyadh not in the U.S.

For Wall Street, already stung by the collapse of WeWork’s IPO and Uber (NYSE: ) Technology Inc.’s chronic under-performance, Aramco is another embarrassment. After offering unrealistic valuations to win a place on the deal, the world’s most famous banks were unable to deliver, attracting scorn from their client and derision from investors. Now, many banks face the prospect of not getting paid for nearly four years of work.

The fact the IPO happened at all this year was a surprise.The deal has been in the works since early 2016, when Prince Mohammed told The Economist newspaper he thought privatization would aid his Vision 2030 campaign to modernize the oil-dependent Saudi economy. But the sale, initially scheduled for 2018, was delayed several times as the Saudi leadership grappled with where to list it and how much it was worth.

By the start of this year, then Aramco chairman and oil minister, Al-Falih, believed the IPO was in the deep freeze and he hoped the deal would go away for good. But the crown prince and Al-Rumayyan, who headed the sovereign wealth fund that would get the proceeds, were still keen. He sought advice.

Throughout the stop-start IPO, one banker played a key role, although he rarely sought the limelight. The boutique operation of Michael Klein, a veteran Wall Street dealmaker who’d gone out on his own when he wasn’t made CEO of Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ). during the financial crisis, advised Aramco directly, helping the company’s chairman to select the banks which would handle the IPO. Alongside Lazard Ltd. and Moelis & Co., Al-Rumayyan appointed his firm as an independent financial adviser.

If anyone could have warned Al-Rumayyan that Wall Street was inflating the Aramco valuation to win the IPO mandate, it was the ever-present Klein. He never did. According to several people, Klein thwarted attempts to have a discussion with the Saudi government about the valuation.

Another boutique bank, Evercore Inc., who worked on the IPO from 2016 to 2018, didn’t return. One of their top bankers, David Waring, warned the kingdom early in the process the $2 trillion was going to be very hard to achieve. Second time around, they ensured they weren’t on the deal by proposing a fee Aramco refused to pay.

While work on the IPO had slowed to a crawl, the crown prince was still insisting the sale take place by early 2021. But in the summer, Al-Rumayyan became anxious the U.S.-China trade war was going to cause an economic slowdown, sending crude prices tumbling and ruling out an IPO for several years.“The royal palace panicked thinking oil prices were about to crash,” said a person who has worked on the IPO for nearly four years. “They saw two options: rush the IPO immediately, or forget about it until much, much later”.First, Saudi Arabia tried to juice the oil market, cutting production to 9.6 million barrels a day, more than 700,000 barrels a day below its official OPEC quota. For the kingdom, it was an unprecedented move. Even so the price of oil briefly dropped to close to $55 a barrel in August, below the $60 to $70 a barrel range that was needed to support the IPO.Al-Rumayyan, convinced time was running out, decided the deal needed to be fast-tracked, persuading Prince Mohammed that if he wanted an IPO, he should put him in charge.

Paid the Price

Al-Falih, who mixed administrative ability with an abrasive style, paid the price for his opposition. He was removed as Aramco chairman on Sept. 3 and replaced by Al-Rumayyan. (He was replaced as oil minister a few weeks later.) The IPO’s champion now sat at the head of the company.With little time to organize the deal, Aramco ruled out an international listing. But Al-Rumayyan still wanted to bring billions in international money into Saudi Arabia. To ensure success – and positive coverage from analysts – he hired almost every bank on Wall Street including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), Bank of America (NYSE: ) and JPMorgan.Al-Rumayyan and Amin Nasser, the Aramco CEO, thought the IPO would be fairly easy. Only a few months earlier, the company had sold its first -- massively oversubscribed -- international bond.

Perhaps blinded by that success, Aramco walked into the IPO under-prepared. Despite four years of work, executives still struggled to answer simple questions from foreign investors, its legal team couldn’t produce documents on time, and nobody at Aramco could convincingly explain why Aramco deserved its $2 trillion valuation.

Then in the early hours of Sept. 14, a fleet of drones attacked the very heart of the Saudi oil industry – the giant crude processing plant at Abqaiq in the kingdom’s eastern desert. Half of Aramco’s production was knocked out in minutes.

Blamed Iran

The kingdom blamed Iran for the attack, but said there would be no interruption in oil supplies to customers around the world. Oil traders, looking at photos of punctured tanks and mangled pipework, were skeptical. Many assumed the IPO would have to be delayed.Prince Mohammed told advisers a delay would be a victory for Iran. The new oil minister, the crown prince’s half-brother Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, and Aramco CEO Nasser promised the damage could be fixed in weeks. Bankers on the IPO were told to keep working.

Saudi Arabia did everything they could to boost the valuation: tax rates were cut further and investors were offered incentives to buy the shares. The intention to float was finally announced by Al-Rumayyan and Nasser on Nov. 4.

But the feedback from international investors didn’t improve. At a meeting in the early hours of Nov. 17, Saudi Arabia decided to scale back the size of the IPO and scrap plans to market the shares internationally. A roadshow in London and other financial capitals was scrapped. The Wall Street banks, who’d fought so hard to get a mandate, were dumped.

The deal became what Prince Abdulaziz, the oil minister, described as “our family and friends” IPO, relying on local retail investors, rich Saudis and regional governments. The Saudi government even spent more than $2 billion of its own cash buying shares. An unsuccessful attempt was even made to persuade Qatar – under economic blockade by Riyadh – to make a large investment.

The deal got done. Prince Mohammed might even get his wish. In a press conference at OPEC’s Vienna HQ Prince Abdulaziz scolded the international press for their coverage of the IPO and said the company would trade at more than $2 trillion in a few months. On the first day of trading, the price jumped 10%, giving a market value of $1.88 trillion.

“Those who have not subscribed in Aramco will be chewing their thumb to the point that I will be worried about them that they go and fix themselves in the hospital,” the oil minister said later in an interview.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/the-wall-street-bankers-who-burst-aramcos-2-trillion-bubble-2013282,0.071,0.851,0.077,0.9496

(Reuters) - Global oil refiners have upgraded processing units and adjusted operations to raise output of low-sulphur residual fuels and marine gasoil (MGO) to prepare for stricter shipping fuel standards that kick in on Jan. 1.

The new International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules prohibit ships from using fuels containing more than 0.5% sulphur, compared with 3.5% through the end of December, unless they are equipped with exhaust-cleaning ""scrubbers"".

The shipping industry consumes about 4 million barrels per day (bpd) of marine bunker fuels, and the rule changes will impact more than 50,000 merchant ships globally, opening a significant new market for fuel producers.

Below is a summary of how top refiners have prepared.

CHINA

The world's largest refiner, Sinopec Corp (SS: ) (HK: ), has started very low-sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) output at 10 refineries in China.

The company plans total VLSFO capacity of 10 million tonnes a year (about 180,000 bpd) by 2020 and build a fleet of 100 barges over the next three years to supply cleaner fuels to ships.

PetroChina (HK: ) has targeted 4 million tonnes of VLSFO in 2020, while Total (PA: ) plans to supply marine fuel in a joint venture with China's Zhejiang Energy.

China Marine Bunker [CMBPC.UL], known as Chimbusco, secured at least 4 million tonnes of VLSFO for the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first two quarters of 2020, and has started to supply all major Chinese ports from bonded storage.

NORTH ASIA

At SK Energy's largest refinery in South Korea, engineers are rushing to complete a new processing unit ahead of schedule.

The unit of SK Innovation (KS: ) started supplying MGO from October and is building a vacuum residue desulphurisation (VRDS) unit that can produce 40,000 bpd of low sulphur fuel oil (LSFO*) due online in March or April. Japan's second-biggest refiner Idemitsu Kosan Co (T: ) is increasing capacity for LSFO, but is also relying on blending to produce IMO2020 compliant bunker fuel.

Hyundai Oilbank has said it will sell VLSFO from November.

In Japan, Fuji Oil Co Ltd (T: ), Cosmo Energy Holdings Co Ltd (T: ) and Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd (T: ) began shipping IMO-compliant fuels in October.

SINGAPORE/SOUTHEAST ASIA

In the world's largest marine fuels market, Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) loaded its first LSFO cargo from its Pulau Bukom refinery in September, and Singapore Refining Company (SRC), a joint venture of Chevron Corp (N: ) and Singapore Petroleum Co [SPCS.UL], supplied its first VLSFO cargo in October.

Chevron said its VLSFO and MGO supply capacity in Asia could double in the next one to two years.

Vitol is building a 30,000 bpd crude processing unit in Malaysia to supply LSFO starting in May 2020, and IRPC Pcl (BK: ) said it will produce 52,000 tonnes of VLSFO in November, making it Thailand's first refinery to produce IMO-compliant fuel.

Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (NS: ) has started supplying IMO-compliant fuel in India.

MIDDLE EAST

Uniper Energy DMCC operates two crude processing units in Fujairah that annually produce 3.6 million tonnes of VLSFO, including 0.1% sulphur fuel used in regional Emission Control Areas.

Brooge Petroleum and Gas Investment Co said it plans a 250,000-bpd refinery in Fujairah to produce low-sulphur fuel.

Qatar Petroleum said in October it has started supplying VLSFO at its ports.

EUROPE

Marine fuel supplier Peninsula Petroleum plans to double VLSFO deliveries to 600,000 tonnes by year-end in Europe and the Americas.

Gunvor Group will overhaul its refinery in Rotterdam in March to produce LSFO.

UNITED STATES

Most U.S. Gulf Coast refiners are able to process heavy crudes used to make IMO-compliant marine fuels, and have spent heavily this year refurbishing distillation units and cokers to process cheaper, heavy grades.

Motiva Enterprises overhauled its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, the nation's largest, this year so it can produce compliant fuels. This month, PBF Energy (N: ), restarted a coker at its Chalmette, Louisiana, refinery that had been idled nine years.

*LSFO stands for fuel oil with sulphur content of between 0.5% and 1.0%; VLSFO for fuel oil with a sulphur content of less than or equal to 0.5%; and ultra low-sulphur fuel oil (ULSFO) for fuel oil with sulphur content of less than or equal to 0.1%. Refineries that lack the technology to product VLSFO outright, may produce LSFO and blend it down to IMO-compliant levels. See the table at for more information.

ABU DHABI/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's executives met officials of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) on Monday to discuss a potential investment in the oil giant's share sale that could raise as much as $25.6 billion, three sources familiar with the talks said.

Aramco has struggled to attract a major cornerstone or anchor investor for its IPO, which could be potentially the world's biggest. It has also approached Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) and Singapore's GIC.

The meeting between Aramco and ADIA, one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds, was separate to an investor roadshow in Abu Dhabi, the second leg of a Gulf marketing effort by Aramco and its advisors.

A similar roadshow was held in Dubai on Sunday.

A spokesman for ADIA declined to comment. Aramco has said it does not comment on specific investor meetings.

""Aramco, have stepped up a gear this month, but the signs are that it is unlikely to be the blockbuster sale that the Kingdom once hoped for,"" said London-based Capital Economics in a note on Monday.

""And plans for this sale to be followed by an international listing seem to have lost momentum.""

The company has also cancelled marketing roadshows for its listing outside of the Gulf because of the lack of interest from foreign institutional investors.

Some investors, who attended the Aramco roadshow in Abu Dhabi on Monday, also expressed mixed feelings about investing in the deal.

Aramco's future weight in the region's benchmark indices was a compelling reason for fund managers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to invest in its shares, a fund manager said after the roadshow.

But another fund manager said Aramco's dividend yield of 4.4% at the top end of its valuation was less attractive compared to other oil companies.

Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) has a dividend yield of 6.48%, Refinitiv data shows.

Aramco is looking to sell 1.5% of the company in the deal, valuing the company between $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion. It has set a base dividend of $75 billion over five years.

The deal is the centrepiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to diversify the Saudi economy away from its reliance on oil.

""For the biggest IPO in history, it is still a wait and see approach for us, how it will perform, who's going to make the market,"" said an investment advisor to high net worth investors in Abu Dhabi.

""The rich valuation, the recent attacks, the oil price, regional tensions – we are yet to get perspective on this.""

Aramco's roadshow was led by Yassir Mufti, vice president of strategy and market analysis, and attended by members of the oil firm's IPO team, according to an investor invite seen by Reuters.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/saudi-aramco-meets-adia-abu-dhabi-funds-in-ipo-pitch--sources-2003784,0.035,0.878,0.087,0.972

LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in some London-listed oil and gas producers including Tullow Oil (L: ), Premier Oil (L: ) and Cairn Energy (L: ) fell on Thursday after the main opposition Labour Party pledged to raise taxes on the sector if it wins a Dec. 12 election.

(Bloomberg) -- China can become a fully developed economy that doesn’t produce any carbon emissions by mid-century.

The nation’s high savings and investment rate allow for the spending required to meet the twin goals, according to a report by The Energy Transitions Commission, a global coalition of executives from across the energy landscape committed to the Paris climate agreement.

The move by the second-biggest economy toward zero emissions is critical for the world to counter climate change. While China has spent more money than any other country on clean energy, it’s still the biggest consumer of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, and is estimated to have as much coal power capacity in the pipeline as the current total in the 28-nation European Union.

The nation could triple its per-capita economic growth and standard of living while cutting final energy demand by 27% in 2050, said the ETC, which published the report in partnership with the Rocky Mountain Institute. That would require reductions in steel and cement use, a more circular use of materials such as plastics, and energy efficiency measures including the electrification of transport.

“China has the institutional, financial and technological advantages of ‘concentrating resources to accomplish large undertakings,’ which makes it well placed to stimulate long-term and large-scale investment once setting up strategic goals,” said Jules Kortenhorst, chief executive officer of RMI. “This helps lay a solid foundation for China to pursue zero-carbon objectives by 2050 and gain the economic and environmental advantages which would result.”

The commissioners of the ETC include executives from Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc (LON: ), ArcelorMittal, Rio Tinto (LON: ) Group, China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. and China Huaneng Group.

Other findings include:

The industry sector would see the most significant cut in final energy demand of 30% but would continue to contribute to 60% of final energy demand.

China’s total primary energy demand could fall by 45% from today to 2050 as a result of less energy being lost in electricity generation. Fossil fuel demand could tumble more than 90% as non-fossil fuels would jump 3.4 times.

Zero-emission target will require total decarbonization of power generation and expansion of power use of about 15,000 terawatt-hours in 2050. That compares with 7,000 terawatt-hour increase last year. 75% of power generation will be met by wind and solar with the support of grid flexibility and storage. This will also need a more than threefold increase in production and use of hydrogen to more 80 million tons in 2050, along with important roles from increased bioenergy and carbon capture.

The report also highlighted key sectoral actions and public policies needed to meet the goal, such as a national carbon price system.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA: ) has selected four groups for the second round of bidding for four refineries up for sale, including China's Sinopec, Abu Dhabi's state investor and two Brazilian firms, according to four people with knowledge of the matter.

Sinopec, Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Co and Brazil's Ultrapar Participações SA (SA: ) and Raizen were chosen to go through to the next phase, they said. Brazil's Raizen is a joint venture between Cosan SA (SA: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ).

Petrobras, as the oil company is known, received non- binding offers in early November for the first block of refineries it plans to sell. It selected the groups that will progress to the second round last week, the sources added, declining to be named as the details are confidential.

The binding offers are expected to be delivered by mid-January, two of the sources said. The first block of refineries is the largest one, with a combined capacity of 961,000 oil barrels per day, or 40% of Brazil's total refining capacity.

Ultrapar, Raízen and Mubadala declined to comment. Petrobras and Sinopec did not immediately comment on the matter.

According to the sources, Ultrapar and Raízen may deliver bids for the two refineries in the southern region, REFAP and REPAR, and for RNEST, in the northeastern state of Pernambuco.

China's Sinopec and Mubadala plan to bid for RLAM, Brazil's oldest refinery, in the northeastern state of Bahia, the people said. RLAM needs significant renovations, and Sinopec is interested in forming a consortium with a Chinese construction company. Mubadala is expected to structure a deal involving Spanish oil company Cepsa, which has Mubadala and Carlyle Group (NASDAQ: ) as investors, two of the sources said.

According to rules set forth by Brazil's antitrust watchdog Cade, bidders can only acquire one refinery in each region.

CONSORTIA

The sources said companies approved for the second round are in talks to create consortia with commodity traders such as Glencore (LON: ) and Vitol, that signed non disclosure agreements at the start of the process and are allowed to join the groups in the binding phase. Vitol and Glencore declined to comment.

Operators of pipelines are also in talks to potentially join groups to operate the logistics assets that Petrobras will sell with each refinery, such as terminals and oil and fuel pipelines, they added.

Among these groups are Canada's Brookfield, which owns gas pipeline network company NTS, previously sold by Petrobras, the sources said. Brookfield declined to comment.

Financial firms such as Canadian pension funds CPPIB and Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec (CDPQ), besides Singapore's GIC, could also join, they said. The companies did not immediately comment.

Oil behemoth Saudi Aramco, which had signed a non disclosure agreement, dropped out of the process, the sources said.

Brazil's history of imposing fuel price controls and a privatization model that will leave Petrobras with a strong presence in Brazil's richest region, the southeast, have reduced the expected competition for the refineries.

Initial estimates that the oil company could fetch up to $18 billion for the refineries have been reduced to around $10 billion.

SECOND BLOCK

A second block of four refineries, which is expected to be put up for sale next year, is much smaller than the first, with a total capacity of roughly 200,000 barrels per day.

REMAN, in the state of Amazonas, has attracted the interest of regional fuel distributor Atem Distribuição de Petroleo, one of the sources said.

India's conglomerate Essar, which has exploration operations in India and refining and fuel distribution assets in Britain, could also bid for one of the units in the second block, the sources added.

EIG Global Energy Partners is also said to be eyeing REGAP, in Minas Gerais, according to one source.

Atem, Essar and EIG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusive-brazil-china-uae-firms-in-second-round-of-bids-for-petrobras-refineries--sources-2006269,0.024,0.912,0.063,0.9697

LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (N: ) is accelerating its biggest asset sales in decades with plans to divest up to $25 billion (£19 billion) of oil and gas fields in Europe, Asia and Africa as it sharpens its focus on a handful of mega projects at home and abroad, banking sources said.

The vast programme, which will see Exxon effectively quit its upstream oil and gas business in Europe, comes amid growing pressure from investors to free up cash for new developments in Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and the United States.

In recent months, the Irving, Texas-based company has drawn up an extensive list of assets, spanning at least 11 countries, which it wants to sell. The list easily exceeds its current $15 billion disposal target for 2021, according to three banking sources with direct knowledge of the plans.

An Exxon spokeswoman said the company does not ""comment on market rumours or speculation.""

Exxon shares were trading 0.4% higher at 1448 GMT.

Exxon, the world's top listed energy company, has struck a number of deals in recent months including a $4.5 billion exit from Norway, and is also already offering assets in Australia, Nigeria, Malaysia.

The expanded plan will see Exxon sell out of operations in the British North Sea, Germany and Romania. In Europe, that would leave it with production in the Netherlands, where it holds a stake together with Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) in the giant Groningen gas field which the government plans to shut down in 2022.

The plan would also see Exxon significantly pare back operations in Southeast Asia with the sale of its assets in Indonesia and Malaysia, the sources said.

In Africa, Exxon wants to sell its operations in Chad, Equatorial Guinea as well as parts of its Nigerian assets.

While Exxon is set to ramp up its spending sharply in the coming years to develop new oil and gas projects, most of its peers have more cautious spending plans due to an uncertain outlook for oil prices and growing pressure from investors to diversify away from fossil fuels towards renewables.

For a factbox on the asset sales

INVESTOR PRESSURE

Exxon responded more slowly to the 2014 oil price crash than some of its rivals that sharply cut spending, putting it under pressure from shareholders to reduce costs. Exxon's shares heavily underperformed relative to other Oil Majors over the past five years.

Unlike rivals such as Shell and BP (LON: ), Exxon did not carry out major review of its portfolio in recent decades. BP sold over $65 billion of assets following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico while Shell sold over $30 billion after acquiring rival BG Group in 2016.

But under Chief Executive Darren Woods, Exxon is set to sharply increase its spending in the coming years as it launches new, large oil and gas developments including in Guyana, Mozambique, Brazil, Papua New Guinea, the United States and possibly Qatar.

In its 2019 investor day, the company said it planned to boost its annual capital spending from $26 billion in 2018 to $30-$35 billion between 2021 and 2025.

Building up a war chest via asset sales could help allay concerns that Exxon will ramp up its debt levels to fund new projects, particularly with oil prices remaining stubbornly close to $60 a barrel.

Moody's Investor Service on Tuesday changed Exxon's outlook to negative from stable due to its negative free cash flow and anticipated use of debt to fund its future capital spending.

Moody's has forecast negative free cash flow of about $7 billion this year and $9 billion next year.

""The company's high level of growth capital investments cannot be funded with operating cash flow and asset sales at projected levels given ExxonMobil's substantial dividend payout, absent meaningfully higher commodity prices and earnings from downstream and chemicals,"" Moody's said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusive-exxon-steps-up-assets-sales-with-sweeping-25-billion-plan-2002119,0.061,0.85,0.089,0.905

(Reuters) - UK stocks fell on Wednesday after three sessions of gains as flaring tensions between China and the United States cast doubt over prospects of a trade deal and retailer Kingfisher (LON: ) slumped 7% following disappointing quarterly sales.

The FTSE 100 ( ) lost 0.8% on its worst day in almost three weeks, as trade concerns weighed on Asia-exposed financial stocks like HSBC (L: ), while oil majors Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) and industrial stocks also slipped. [O/R]

Losses on the more domestically-focussed FTSE 250 ( ) were slightly more contained, as the index gave up 0.3%.

However, earnings-driven gains helped pub operator Mitchells & Butlers (L: ), software company Micro Focus (L: ) and thermal processing service provider Bodycote (L: ) rise between 4%-5% and outperform the mid-cap index.

Worries over U.S.-China trade escalated as President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on imports if no deal was reached, while nerves were jangled further after the U.S. Senate passed legislation backing protesters in Hong Kong, which drew condemnation from Beijing.

That spurred a broad sell-off across global markets as investors chose to prioritise safer bets over risky assets like stocks. They will also keep an eye on the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest minutes, though no surprises are expected.

""Given that the U.S. Senate has just passed legislation in support of the Hong Kong protests, such a move threatens to drive a wedge into ongoing negotiations while potentially raising the barrier to a trade deal,"" FXTM analyst Han Tan said.

Shares in Aviva Plc (L: ) fell 3.5% as investors were underwhelmed by a strategy update from the insurer, which analysts say is struggling for direction since replacing its top boss.

Domestic stocks, which have benefited from polls indicating a likely Conservative victory in the upcoming election, weakened after three sessions, but still outperformed the broader European benchmark ( ).

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell's (L: ) gender pay gap in Britain edged higher in 2019 following the acquisition of a utility company, with women earning on average 18.7% less than men.

This year's figure, which compares to 18.6% in 2018, comes after Shell UK incorporated around 1,000 employees from First Utility which it had acquired in March, Shell said in a report.

Excluding First Utility, which was re-branded Shell Energy, the pay gap would have narrowed to 15.1%.

Gender gap pay is defined as the difference in the average pay and bonuses of all men and women across an organisation.

""We have made good progress in building an inclusive and diverse workplace, and we have increased the proportion of women in senior leadership positions,"" Sinead Lynch, Shell UK Country Chair, said in a statement.

""However, we still have further to go and will continue to work to close the gender pay gap across all parts of the business.""

The oil and gas sector has traditionally had a much higher ratio of men to women. In April 2019, Shell employed more than 6,000 employees in Britain, of whom two-thirds are men.

Shell said its UK gender pay gap stems from having fewer women in senior leadership positions as well as in specialist roles attracting higher levels of pay such as trading.

""Our gender pay gap also reflects wider societal issues such as relatively fewer women studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects at university,"" Shell said in a statement.

Shell UK said it had achieved its ambition to reach 30% women in senior leadership positions by 2020 which it aims to increase to 35% by 2025.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-uk-gender-pay-gap-widens-slightly-in-2019-2001222,0.035,0.895,0.069,0.9313

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Co aims to exhaust its vast oil and gas reserves even as many consumers switch to cleaner sources of energy, a senior executive in the Gulf oil company said.

The world's transition away from fossil fuel in an effort to slash greenhouse gas emissions is expected to accelerate in coming decades, leaving many oil companies and producing nations pondering their long-term future.

But for state-run ADNOC, the main oil-producing company in the United Arab Emirates, which supplies nearly 3% of global oil demand, crude is set to remain the revenue backbone, ADNOC's upstream executive director Abdulmunim al-Kindy told Reuters.

""Our oil is our gold,"" al-Kindy said in an interview during the ADIPEC oil and gas conference in Abu Dhabi, capital of the UAE.

""With the reserves we have, the challenge we have is monetising it at the right time.""

To achieve that, ADNOC has undergone a drive to slash extraction costs to rival other major producers including OPEC heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Iraq.

ADNOC has embarked on a broader transformation strategy since 2016, expanding its oil and gas business, listing one of its subsidiaries and overhauling its trading operations.

This week it announced it was listing its flagship Murban crude grade and has partnered with Intercontinental Exchange Inc and oil majors including BP (LON: ), Total and Shell (LON: ) in a new exchange to be launched in 2020.

""We are really the lowest-cost producers because of the efficiencies we drive,"" al-Kindy said.

ADNOC is also seeking to diversify the sources of energy it can offer.

The company is in the midst of a vast expansion of its production of , the least polluting fossil fuel whose demand is forecast to rise sharply in the coming decades as Asian economies consume more power.

It has signed deals with oil majors to boost its gas output and has said it was seeking investment opportunities abroad in liquefied natural gas (LNG).

""Whatever resources we have, we are going to really drive the monetisation of these resources. We are not going to leave anything in the ground if we can,"" he said.

""That's the bottom line. Be it gas, conventional or unconventional, oil, conventional or unconventional, it is going to come to the market and that's our aim.""

ADNOC aims to reach 1 billion cubic feet per day of unconventional gas production before 2030.

(Bloomberg) -- Two years ago, when the initial public offering of Saudi oil giant Aramco held the imagination of foreign investors, President Donald Trump felt compelled to publicly lobby for the share sale to happen in America.“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump tweeted in November 2017.Today Saudi Aramco isn’t just shunning New York -- and other international exchanges -- as a listing venue, but has decided it won’t even market the IPO to American, Canadian, European or Japanese investors. Instead, Aramco plans to rely heavily on ultra-wealthy Saudis, many of whom have been pressed to invest, to get the deal done. Saudi banks are loosening lending regulations to allow locals to buy more shares.

The IPO once was promoted as the strongest sign of economic change in Saudi Arabia: the deal that was going to attract tens of billions of foreign capital into the kingdom. Instead, a slimmed down share sale is starting to look more like a levy on the country’s economy as Saudi investors, large and small, take the place of foreign money managers.It may well still be the world’s largest IPO, perhaps raising about $25 billion and valuing the company at $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion, well above the biggest names of Silicon Valley. But that’s short of the $100 billion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said he was hoping to raise when he first mooted the IPO in 2016. At that point, he targeted a valuation of at least $2 trillion.“The valuation range is higher than most institutional investors would consider attractive,” said Neil Beveridge, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “Aramco’s price range would imply a premium valuation to western oil majors on almost every valuation metric.”The new valuation implies Aramco, which has promised a dividend of at least $75 billion next year, will reward investors with a dividend yield of between 4.4% and 4.7%, below what other oil majors pay. Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). pays a dividend yield of just under 5%, while Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc pays 6.4%.

So poor is the international appetite for the deal, even at the lower valuation, Saudi Aramco decided at the last minute against marketing the IPO in the U.S., Canada and Japan -- three markets traditionally seen as a must-go destination for any big Wall Street deal. Instead of the planned approach to American investors, using what lawyers and bankers know as the 144A rule of the U.S. Securities Act, Aramco decided on Sunday the tepid interest meant it wasn’t worth the trouble.

The array of Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) & Co, with mandates to sell the stock to international investors, were taken aback by the sudden decision, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing private conversations.

Skipping the U.S. means saying goodbye to powerful American pension funds with billions of dollars managed from cities like Boston and Los Angeles.

On Monday, Aramco’s banks told investors in London and other European cities that roadshow events planned for this week had been canceled.

In a sign of Aramco’s shifting ambitions, the company has yet to publish an English version of the updated prospectus, more than 24 hours after the Arabic version posted the target price range.The difference between local and foreign investors is that Prince Mohammed, the country’s day-to-day ruler, has leverage at home. Overseas, he has almost none.

Many of the rich Saudi families that will now become key investors in Aramco learned the ruthlessness of Prince Mohammed during the crackdown that saw many arrested in the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh in 2017. Prince Mohammed also controls the local banking industry, which will lend billions of dollars to Saudi retail investors to buy shares.Despite the tepid interest overseas, the 34-year-old Prince Mohammed is all but sure to get the job done -- even if the result falls short of his original ambitions. As well as a lower valuation between $1.6 and $1.7 trillion, it won’t be the 5% of company’s capital he envisioend. Instead just 1.5% will be offered.

The combination of a lower valuation and a smaller stake means that there will almost certainly be enough Saudi money to buy the shares – and perhaps guarantee reasonable post-IPO trading -- but the sale will be a long way from the seismic global financial event Prince Mohammed touted in back in 2016.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/aramco-failure-to-win-foreign-investors-makes-ipo-a-local-event-1999845,0.03,0.861,0.109,0.9965

BP Plc, (LON: ) Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, (NYSE: ) Total SA (PA: ) and Vitol Group are among companies taking stakes in a new ICE-operated crude futures exchange in Abu Dhabi, according to people familiar with the matter.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc. Chairman Jeffrey Sprecher confirmed the partnerships, speaking on Monday to reporters in Abu Dhabi. Other partners in the emirate’s oil exchange are Petrochina Co., Inpex Corp. and JXTG Holdings Inc. of Japan, PTT Pcl of Thailand, and South Korea-based GS Caltex Corp., Sprecher said.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will join major international oil companies, traders and customers as founding partners in a platform operated by ICE (NYSE: ) for the trading of futures contracts in Abu Dhabi’s flagship Murban crude, Adnoc Chief Executive Officer Sultan Al Jaber said in a speech earlier Monday. Murban futures will allow buyers to hedge in the open market, he said.

Although oil producers across the Persian Gulf pump about a fifth of the world’s oil, they have never had a region-wide, exchange-traded crude benchmark. Adnoc wants the new Murban futures contract to eventually serve that function. The platform will be based in Abu Dhabi’s financial district.

Murban is Adnoc’s most plentiful grade, at about 1.7 million barrels a day, and accounts for more than half of the crude pumped in the United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi holds most of the oil in the U.A.E., the third-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

(Bloomberg) -- Not so bad. That’s the view of most strategists examining the European earnings season. As we approach the reporting period’s final stretch, the picture isn’t as grim as initially feared as most sectors are actually delivering growth. But overall, the region is in an earnings recession and looking forward, companies may struggle to meet expectations for the fourth quarter and for next year without some improvement on the macro-economic front.

We recently highlighted that Europe might have recorded profit growth in the third quarter if it hadn’t been for the energy sector. Bloomberg Intelligence strategists even show that without a few “bad apples” in each country, companies posted a decent beat.

The table below is pretty clear: energy stocks and financials provided the bulk of the earnings drag. The problem with those laggards is that they carry a heavy weight in indexes. For example, BP (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) make up almost 16% of the .

Aside from energy, earnings have not only been brighter than consensus expectations, but also better than that implied by feeble Purchasing Managers’ Index economic data, JPMorgan (NYSE: ) strategists say.

They also point out that overall, sales growth is 2% year-on-year, which is particularly encouraging given the fall in commodity prices. This is usually a “good lead indicator for revenue growth.” The top line could pick up further, provided that commodity prices stay at current levels or bounce back, JPMorgan says.

Not everyone is so keen though. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) strategists say the earnings beat has been of “low quality,” and that companies on the MSCI Europe Index are on track to deliver a third consecutive quarter of negative earnings growth on average. Most of all, they struggle to see the validity of the consensus at this stage, with analyst expectations of 10% earnings-per-share growth for the next two quarters and full-year 2020. We probably haven’t seen the end of the earnings downgrades yet.

In the end, as a potential positive outcome on the trade front looks increasingly priced in, it may all come down to the macro improvement. JPMorgan strategists expect European PMIs to follow the improvement in money supply and China export orders, noting that global manufacturing PMIs have been stable for three months. The ignored the deterioration in the figures this year and now the composite PMI has stabilized just above the contraction zone.

British markets avoided sharp declines despite a host of trigger points, including weak Chinese factory output data, anxiety around U.S.-China trade and political uncertainty in the U.S. amid an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.

Slowing Chinese factory output growth was yet another sign of how Beijing's trade dispute with Washington was weighing on demand. To that end, China said the countries were holding in-depth discussions on a ""phase one"" trade agreement.

(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia put a valuation on oil giant Aramco of between $1.6 trillion and $1.71 trillion, well below the $2 trillion target sought by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman since he first touted the deal in 2016.

The kingdom will list only 1.5% of the company on the Tadawul and the offering will mainly target local investors. If shares price at 32 Saudi riyals ($8.53) -- the high end of the range -- it will just beat Alibaba (NYSE: ) Group Holding Ltd. to the title of the world’s biggest IPO.

At the lower end of 30 riyals, Aramco will still be more than three times bigger than the entire Saudi stock market. A poll of 24 money managers by Bloomberg News shows more than 40% put the company’s fair range at $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion.

The new valuation implies Aramco, which has promised a dividend of at least $75 billion next year, will reward investors with a yield of between 4.4% and 4.7%. That compares with just under 5% for Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) and 6.4% for Shell (LON: ).

At this rate, it would dwarf last year’s payouts from the 80 listed firms on the Saudi bourse that paid dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors who buy into the IPO have been guaranteed that the dividend won’t fall until after 2024.

No matter what the final valuation, the share sale will create a public company of unmatched profitability. Aramco earned a net income of $111 billion in 2018 on revenue of $315 billion. It pumps about 10% of the world’s oil from giant fields under the kingdom’s deserts.

The company is so big, investors and analysts were concerned it could drain liquidity from the Saudi market. In recent months, many analysts have said that local investors -- key for a successful deal -- were offloading some of their portfolio to buy Aramco shares.

(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) is one of the most bearish -- and bullish -- on Saudi Aramco’s valuation.

In a presentation for investors, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) bankers ran through several valuation models that gave a spread of about $1 trillion between the most bearish and bullish scenarios.

For example, based on a dividend discount model the spread ran from $1.06 trillion up to $2 trillion. The base case was $1.52 trillion, according to the presentation seen by Bloomberg. A spokesman for Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) declined to comment.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) isn’t alone in struggling to pinpoint exactly how much Aramco is worth. Valuation has been a sticking point since the IPO was first touted in 2016. Aramco faces a delicate balance as it seeks to push its IPO valuation as close as possible to Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s $2 trillion -- a figure that’s been met with skepticism from many professional investors -- while making sure it’s attractive to potential Saudi buyers.

Range of some of the banks with the IPO mandate:

Another Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) scenario shows a valuation of between $1 trillion and $2.2 trillion, according to the presentation. A third model shows a range of $1.07 trillion and $2.5 trillion.

Among 16 banks that offered a valuation, the range in estimates ran from $1.1 trillion at the bottom right up to $2.5 trillion, a number that even the crown prince might find optimistic. The midpoint was $1.75 trillion, according to people who’ve reviewed all the research.

This $1.4 trillion spread between the top and low end of valuations is more than the combined market capitalizations of Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: )., Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Chevron Corp (NYSE: ), the world’s three largest publicly listed energy companies.

Ultimately, investors will decide. The price range for the IPO will be announced on Nov. 17 and bookbuilding for the offering will start the same day. Retail investors will have to bid at the top end of that range and the company will set the final price for all investors based on institutional investors’ book-building process that ends on Dec. 5.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/morgan-stanley-is-latest-bank-to-offer-1-trillion-aramco-spread-1997383,0.026,0.929,0.045,0.6705

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) is buying French renewable power company EOLFI as part of its plans to ramp up the oil major's electricity business.

EOLFI has largely focused on solar and wind projects, including offshore wind farms. Offshore wind is one of the fastest growing renewables markets, with floating structures the technology's next frontier because they utilise waters that are too deep for traditional turbines fixed to the seabed.

Shell, which generates most of its revenue from oil and gas, wants to become the world's largest electricity company and expects to invest $2 billion (£1.6 billion) to $3 billion a year -- nearly 10% of its overall spending -- on its power division by 2025.

""We believe the union of EOLFI’s expertise and portfolio with Shell's resources and ability to scale up will help make electricity a significant business for Shell,"" Offshore Wind Shell vice president Dorine Bosman said in a statement.

Shell did not disclose financial details of the deal, which is expected to close in December.

EOLFI is part of a group developing a pilot project off the coast of Brittany, France, as it ramps up activity in a market the International Energy Agency says could attract a cumulative $1 trillion of investment by 2040.

By Arpan Varghese

HOUSTON/BENGALURU (Reuters) - As the thirst for electricity to power drilling rigs in West Texas drives the state's energy needs to new highs, oil and gas companies are increasingly relying on wind and solar power to ensure that the shale boom continues.

Oil and gas firms operating in the Permian shale basin in West Texas, the nation's biggest, have been largely behind growth in the area's energy demand, according to Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which oversees most of the state's electricity grid.

Securing ample, reliable energy supply is critical to sustaining the shale boom that has helped the United States eclipse Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's biggest oil producer.

Wind and solar farms help oil and gas producers lock in a growing part of that supply in a way that can be easily tailored to their needs as they keep ramping up production, industry experts say. ""Gas generation gets cheap if you're building at a large scale. But if you're trying to build to match your refinery or E&P (exploration and production) operations, you'd want to build something relatively inexpensive at a smaller scale,"" says Manan Ahuja, manager at North America Power Analytics at S&P Global Platts.

""You can add more panels or windmills at a later point if your exploration and production grows.""

For a graphic on Energy sources vs West Texas demand, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7930/7861/TexasEnergy.png

Building their own on-field wind or solar farms is one way to safeguard electricity supply, long-term supply deals with renewable energy firms is another.

One recent example is Occidental Petroleum Corp (N: ), a major player in the Permian, which announced early last month the launch of a solar-powered facility to power an oilfield operation there.

A unit of Occidental also signed a long-term power purchase agreement with a joint venture between Macquarie's Green Investment Group (GIG) and Core Solar LLC for 109 MW of solar energy, beginning in 2021.

""Use of solar energy is expected to reduce the cost and carbon intensity of Occidental's operations,"" the company said in a statement.

Oil major Exxon Mobil (N: ), which aims to boost its Permian output to more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2024, last year also signed a multi-year supply contract with Danish renewable firm Orsted (CO: )

Under that deal, Orsted would make available about 500 megawatts (MW) split evenly between wind and power to fuel Exxon's Permian operations, with its Texas wind farm due to come online early next year, and the solar project due in 2021.

Typically, energy firms will mix and renewables.

Houston-based Apache Corp (N: ), for example, uses solar, natural gas and diesel to power its operations in the Permian basin at locations where they're not connected to a power grid.

Together, wind and solar power this year have nearly overtaken coal as the state's second-biggest source of electricity behind natural gas, according to ERCOT. The council expects West Texas electricity demand to keep growing by around 10% per year over the next five years.

The phasing out of federal tax breaks for wind and solar projects due to begin next year offers additional incentive to ramp up renewable projects and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects nearly half of wind projects scheduled for this year to come online in December.

Oil major Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), said it has started using solar energy to power parts of their Permian operations this year, and that while it welcomed the tax incentives they were unlikely to be a decisive factor behind the industry's push into renewable technologies.

""Whether more oil and gas companies decide to transition into renewables likely hinges more on overall corporate strategy than a single tax provision,"" Shell spokeswoman Anna Arata said.

Environment Texas, an advocacy group that has sued major oil companies over air pollution, lauds the use of renewables to reduce carbon emissions during oil and gas drilling, but Executive Director Luke Metzger says eliminating those fuels altogether remains its ultimate goal.

""It is certainly ironic that oil and gas companies would use renewable energy to pump out more fossil fuels.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/the-permian-paradox-texas-shale-players-go-green-to-drill-more-1994535,0.011,0.891,0.098,0.9958

By Jennifer Hiller

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ) and Chevron Corp (N: ) on Friday posted sharply lower quarterly results despite increases in oil and gas production as lower energy prices soured earnings for most oil majors.

The two U.S. oil majors credited higher production in the top U.S. shale field for similar 3% volume increases, while warning that sizeable cost overruns at a giant oil field in Kazakhstan, where both are partners, would affect future earnings.

Results mirrored weaker quarterly earnings at BP Plc (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ), which indicated they might delay dividend increases or a buyback program if current low prices continue.

In the third quarter, global benchmark Brent crude ( ) fell 8.7%, the worst quarterly drop since the fourth quarter of 2018, while U.S. crude ( ) dropped 7.5% as concerns about the trade war between the United States and China plunged global economic growth to its lowest levels in a decade.

Investors have fled the energy sector in recent years due to returns that significantly lag market indexes. Exxon's share performance in the last three years was down 6.9% while Chevron's rose 20.4%, both well below the 44.6% gain in Standard & Poor's 500 index ( ).

Exxon's profit was nearly halved to $3.17 billion, or 75 cents per share, beating analysts' recently reduced estimate of 67 cents a share, according to Refinitiv IBES. The results included a favorable tax impact of 7 cents a share. Operating profits in each of Exxon's major businesses fell compared with the same period a year ago.

Chevron's earnings fell 36% to $2.58 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the quarter. Excluding items, the company said it earned $1.55 per share, exceeding the $1.45 expected by analysts.

The two are partners in the Tengiz oilfield in Kazakstan, where the operator, Chevron, said on Friday that overruns will balloon project expenses by 25% to $45.2 billion. It blamed a one-year delay in an expansion project and higher construction and equipment costs.

""If you take away the initial contingencies that they have baked in, it's almost a 50% cost increase to the project,"" said Anish Kapadia, a director at London-based Palissy Advisors.

Exxon shares were up 2.5% at $69.24 on Friday afternoon while Chevron's were flat at $116.14.

Exxon and Chevron are racing in the top U.S. shale field to reach 1 million barrels per day of production within a few years.

Chevron's Permian Basin production rose 35% from the same period a year ago to 455,000 barrels of oil and gas daily, while Exxon's daily output reached 293,0000 barrels, up more than 70% in a year.

Smaller oil and gas companies in the field are struggling to generate profits, prompting speculation that the majors will scoop up smaller rivals at bargain-basement prices.

""There's a lot of things to consider,"" said Neil Hansen, Exxon vice president, on a call with analysts. ""It's just a question of whether or not we can transact at the right value.""

(Bloomberg) -- America’s two biggest oil majors are leaning on booming shale production in the Permian Basin, the once-overlooked region in West Texas and New Mexico, to weather the gathering macroeconomic storm of lower oil demand, weak commodity prices and slowing global growth.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) said Friday its production from the basin rose 70% in the third quarter compared with a year ago while Chevron Corp (NYSE: ) reported a 35% gain. Those huge increases are likely to offset any slowdown from U.S. independent explorers under intense pressure to slow output following years of losses.

While Exxon’s per-share profit exceeded estimates, analysts had lowered the bar in recent weeks as the outlook darkened. Chevron was the only oil major to fall short of analysts’ predictions after reporting a $430 million tax charge.

Oil producers are bracing for a tough 2020 amid signs that worldwide crude output will swamp demand, despite the best efforts of OPEC and allied producers to control supplies. Meanwhile, a raging trade war between the world’s two largest economies is undercutting demand for petroleum-based fuels and chemicals.

Exxon rose 1.4% to $68.50 at 9:56 a.m. in pre-market trading in New York. It reported $11.2 billion was spent on dividends and new projects in the quarter exceeded cash flow from operations by 25%.

“The material capex outspend and lack of dividend coverage in the near term is unlikely to entice investors,” RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note to clients.

Chevron (NYSE: ) fell 1.3%. Profits for the upstream division beat estimates, driven by lower corporate costs, Borkhataria said.

Earlier in the week, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and BP (LON: ) Plc posted better-than-expected results, only for their share prices to be battered amid rising anxiety over their ability to plump shareholder returns.

Despite its positive earnings report, Exxon is struggling to cover its dividend payments with free cash flow, as a result of its $30 billion-a-year capital spending program. Instead the supermajor resorting to asset sales from the Gulf of Mexico to Malaysia to help fund the payout without incurring extra debt.

Analysts downgraded their forecasts for Exxon earlier this month when the oil major said it would take a hit from lower commodity prices, a communication strategy introduced this year and aimed at reducing share-price volatility on the day earnings are reported. A surprise first-quarter loss at Exxon’s refining division and a big miss for the second quarter have hurt the stock this year, at a time when management is trying to win support for its long-term plan to rebuild its oil and gas division.

Expectations have been high for Chevron, which is close to overtaking Shell as the world’s second-largest publicly traded oil company. It was the best performing Big Oil stock in 2019 after hiking its share buyback program 25% and dividend by 6%.

CEO Mike Wirth is forging a reputation as oil’s “Mr. Discipline” for his unwillingness to splurge on major new projects and walking away from a $33 billion takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE: ). in May after being outbid. But investors are starting to question whether Chevron has enough in the locker for growth after 2023.

Chevron’s interest in Anadarko begs the question of what company it may be prepared to buy next, especially as stock valuations in the Permian Basin have plummeted this year amid low oil prices and investor apathy toward independent producers.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/permian-surge-helps-exxon-and-chevron-weather-oil-slump-1989861,0.071,0.867,0.063,-0.0194

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's giant state oil company finally kick-started its initial public offering (IPO) on Sunday, announcing its intention to float on the domestic bourse in what could be the world's biggest listing as the kingdom seeks to diversify its economy away from oil.

But in its long-awaited announcement, Aramco, the world's most profitable company, offered few specifics on the number of shares to be sold, pricing or the date for a launch.

Bankers have told the Saudi government that investors will likely value the company at around $1.5 trillion, below the $2 trillion valuation touted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman when he first floated the idea of an IPO nearly four years ago.

Aramco also did not mention what measures it has taken to beef up security following unprecedented attacks on its oil plants in September.

Sources have told Reuters the oil company could offer 1%-2% of its shares on the local bourse, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion. A deal over $25 billion would top the record-breaking one of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (N: ) in 2014.

""Today is the right opportunity for new investors to reap the benefits of Aramco's ability to achieve value, and boost it on the long-term,"" Aramco Chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan told a news conference at the company's headquarters in the eastern city of Dhahran.

The company will spend the next 10 days talking to investors and sounding out their interest and the price range will follow, he said.

The IPO is designed to turbocharge Prince Mohammed's ambitious economic reform agenda by raising billions to build non-energy industries and diversify revenue streams.

Rumayyan said a decision on an international listing for Aramco shares will be made in the future, without giving a time frame or possible venue.

""Selling a small piece of Aramco in a captive market gives the KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) more control to prop the value of Aramco up over its fair value,"" said Gary Ross, CEO at Investors.

Confirmation of the sale of shares in the oil giant, whose formal name is Saudi Arabian Oil Co, comes about seven weeks after the crippling attacks on its oil facilities, underlining Saudi Arabia's determination to push on with the listing regardless.

Aramco said it does not expect the Sept. 14 attacks, which targeted plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil industry and initially halved its production, would have a material impact on its business, operations and financial condition.

Aramco accounted for about one in every eight barrels of crude oil produced globally from 2016 to 2018, it said on Sunday.

Its net income for the third quarter of 2019 amounted to $21.1 billion, according to Reuters calculations, dwarfing the income for the same period of oil giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ), which was just over $3 billion.

Chief Executive Amin Nasser said at the news conference that Aramco plans to release the prospectus on Nov. 9.

To help get the deal done, Saudi Arabia is relying on easy credit for retail investors and hefty contributions from rich locals.

""Whatever this local round achieves, with domestic players being strong armed into investing, international investors are still going to value this well below the expectations of (Crown Prince) Mohammed bin Salman,"" said Rory Fyfe, managing director at Mena Advisors.

LURING INVESTORS

The Saudi stock market fell 2% on Sunday after the announcement. The benchmark index ( ) is down nearly a fifth since May as local institutions sold shares to prepare for the Aramco deal, fund managers and analysts say.

Salah Shamma, head of investment, MENA, at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity, said some local investors could be selling other shares in order to shift investments to Aramco, but this could well be a case of ""short-term pain for long-term gain.""

To comfort investors, Aramco said on Sunday the state will forgo its right to receive a portion of cash dividends on shares, giving priority to new shareholders.

Aramco is also cutting royalties it pays to the state. Effective Jan. 1, 2020, it will adopt a progressive royalty scheme, with a marginal rate set at 15% up to $70 per barrel, 45% between $70 and $100, and 80% if the price rises higher.

The firm said the Saudi market regulator, which approved the application to list on Sunday, issued an exemption for non-resident institutional foreign investors to subscribe.

Saudi investors would be eligible to receive bonus shares - a maximum of 100 bonus shares for every 10 allotted shares.

At a valuation of $1.5 trillion, Aramco would still be worth at least 50% more than the world's most valuable listed companies, Microsoft Corp (O: ) and Apple Inc (O: ), which each have a market capitalisation of about $1 trillion.

But a 1% sale would raise ""only"" around $15 billion for Saudi coffers, ranking Aramco as the 11th biggest IPO of all time, Refinitiv data show. (For a graphic on the top 10 largest global IPOs, see https://tmsnrt.rs/33gWypM)

""Some perspective on the Aramco IPO for the overall Saudi diversification story is needed: the likely Aramco IPO proceeds will be less than the Aramco dividends the government received in the first half of 2019 alone,"" said Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at Tellimer.

(GRAPHIC: Aramco vs. Oil Majors 9-month earnings link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/7184/7166/Pasted%20Image.jpg)

THE 'RIGHT TIME'

The promised listing has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Prince Mohammed flagged it in 2016.

Aramco mandated 27 banks to work on the deal including Citigroup (NYSE: ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE: ) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ).

""I think this is the right time for us to take Aramco to be a public company ... we wanna go IPO and we wanna go now,"" Rumayyan told reporters on Sunday when asked about the timing.

Initial hopes for a blockbuster international listing of about 5% were dashed when the share sale was halted last year amid debate over where to list Aramco overseas.

Aramco said the IPO timetable was delayed because it began a process to acquire a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SE: ).

Prince Mohammed also came under intense international criticism last year for the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul by Saudi operatives, a murder for which the crown prince has said he bears responsibility ""because it happened under my watch.""

The death tarnished the image of the kingdom's de facto ruler and imperiled his plans to diversify the economy. Republican and Democratic lawmakers, also citing the civilian toll from a Saudi air campaign in Yemen, have ramped up efforts to block U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

IPO preparations were revived this summer after Aramco attracted huge interest in its first international bond sale, seen as a pre-IPO relationship-building exercise with investors.

But a listing announcement expected on Oct. 20 was delayed after advisers said they needed more time to lock in cornerstone investors, three sources told Reuters.

A growing movement to fight climate change and embrace new ""green"" technologies have put some fund managers, particularly in Europe and the United States, off the oil and gas sector.

The bond sale in April forced the secretive company to reveal its finances for the first time, including net income of $111 billion -- more than a third bigger than the combined net income of the five super oil majors. Those companies have been raising payouts to shareholders to counter rising pressure from climate activism.

Aramco said on Sunday it intended to declare aggregate ordinary cash dividends of at least $75 billion in 2020.

At a valuation of $1.5 trillion, this would mean a dividend yield of 5%, below that offered by rival Royal Dutch Shell (L: ). Shell's dividend yield is over 6%, according to Refinitiv data.

Saudi Arabia's state oil company kick-started its initial public offering (IPO) on Sunday, announcing its intention to list on the domestic bourse as the kingdom seeks to diversify and create the world's most valuable listed company.

Aramco did not give a time frame or say how much of the company it would sell, but sources have told Reuters the oil company could offer 1%-2% of its shares on the local bourse, raising as much $20 billion-$40 billion.

Aramco said the IPO would be split into two tranches: one each for institutional and individual investors. The percentage of shares to be sold and the purchase price would be determined after the book-building period, it added in a statement.

Confirmation of the share sale in Saudi Arabian Oil Co, or Aramco, as the oil giant is usually known, comes about seven weeks after crippling attacks on its oil facilities, underlining Saudi Arabia's determination to push on with the listing regardless.

The IPO of the world's most profitable company is designed to turbocharge Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's economic reform agenda by raising billions to diversify the kingdom, whose dependency on oil was highlighted by the production impact of the Sept. 14 attacks.

Aramco said in Sunday's statement that it posted a net income of $68 billion during the nine-month period ending on September 30. Revenues and other income related to sales for the same period amounted to $244 billion, it added.

Aramco plans to release the IPO prospectus on Nov. 10, Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya said on Sunday, citing sources.

Aramco said the Saudi market regulator, which approved its application to list on Sunday, had issued an exemption for non-resident institutional foreign investors to subscribe.

Saudi nationals would be eligible to receive bonus shares.

The listing announcement had been expected on Oct. 20 but was delayed after advisers said they needed more time to lock in cornerstone investors, three sources told Reuters.

To help get the deal done, Saudi Arabia is relying on easy credit for retail investors and hefty contributions from rich locals.

Valuation challengeAlthough Prince Mohammed put a $2 trillion valuation on the company in early 2016, bankers and company insiders say Aramco's value is closer to $1.5 trillion.

A growing movement to fight climate change and embrace new ""green"" technologies have put some fund managers, particularly in Europe and the United States, off the oil and gas sector.

At a valuation of $1.5 trillion, Aramco would still be worth at least 50% more than the world's most valuable companies, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ), which each have a market capitalisation of about $1 trillion.

But a 1% sale would 'only' raise around $15 billion for Saudi coffers, less than the $25 billion generated by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE: ) in its record-breaking IPO in 2014.

It would rank Aramco as the 11th biggest IPO of all time, Refinitiv data show. (For a graphic on the top 10 largest global IPOs, click https://tmsnrt.rs/33gWypM)

A sale of 2% of Aramco shares at a $1.5 trillion valuation would make it the biggest IPO of all time, beating Alibaba's.

The prospect of the world's largest oil company selling a piece of itself has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Prince Mohammed flagged it three years ago.

Initial hopes for a blockbuster international listing of about 5% were dashed when the share sale was halted last year amid debate over where to list Aramco overseas.

Aramco said the IPO timetable was delayed because it began a process to acquire a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp .

IPO preparations were revived over the summer after Aramco attracted huge interest in its first international bond sale, seen as a pre-IPO relationship-building exercise with investors.

The bond sale forced the secretive company to reveal its finances for the first time, including net income of $111 billion, over a third bigger than the combined net income of the five super majors Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch/Shell , BP (LON: ) , Chevron (NYSE: ) and Total .

Oil majors have been raising payouts to shareholders to counter rising pressure from climate activism.

Aramco said on Sunday it intended to declare aggregate ordinary cash dividends of at least $75 billion in 2020.

At a valuation of $1.5 trillion, this would mean a dividend yield of 5%, below those offered by competitors such as Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) .

Shell's dividend yield is over 6% and Exxon's over 5%, according to Refinitiv data.

The September attacks on Aramco's largest oil plant, which shut off about 5% of global supply, raised questions about the vulnerability of Aramco's oil fields, plants and exports amid deepening regional tensions.

Aramco hired nine banks as joint global coordinators to lead the IPO, including JPMorgan (NYSE: ) , Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) and Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank . It added a number of banks as bookrunners.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) faced a torrent of criticism from analysts on Friday for warning of possible delays to its $25 billion (£19 billion) share buyback programme, with some saying the move had undermined the credibility of the oil giant's management.

Shell, the world's second-largest listed oil and gas company, saw its shares close more than 4% lower on Thursday, wiping out $10 billion of its market value. It had earlier reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profits which were, however, overshadowed by Chief Executive Ben van Beurden's warning about shareholder returns.

""The prevailing weak macroeconomic conditions and challenging outlook inevitably create uncertainty about the pace of reducing gearing to 25% and completing the share buyback programme within the 2020 timeframe,"" van Beurden said.

In a call with analysts on Thursday, van Beurden sought to play down the warning, saying Shell still intended to complete the buyback on schedule by the end of 2020.

That did little to ease investor concerns.

""The planned $25 billion share buyback before end-2020 was acknowledged by the CEO as a 'statement of the obvious.' We agree but it had a predictable and in our view unnecessary impact,"" UBS analyst Jon Rigby said in a note.

The comments, Rigby said, ""are likely to exasperate long-suffering investors further"". Rigby retains a 'buy' recommendation for Shell.

Shell, the most profitable oil major in 2018 ahead of larger rival ExxonMobil (N: ), has in recent years been many investors' top pick among the group after the Anglo-Dutch firm cut costs and ramped up commitments for shareholder returns.

Shell plans to boost payouts to investors through dividends and share buybacks to $125 billion between 2021 and 2025.

Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint said van Beurden was being over-cautious.

""We've no doubt reiterating our buy on Shell is like talking to the wall today and it's a blow for one of our 2019 top picks,"" Clint said in a note.

Alasdair McKinnon of the Scottish Investment Fund, which holds shares in Shell, said Shell were right to flag the warning.

""Were they a bit harshly treated yesterday? Possibly but it should mean that everyone's expectations are in the right place,"" McKinnon told Reuters.

BP (LON: ) on Tuesday also indicated that its expected dividend boost was now likely to happen next year and not by the end of 2019.

After a decade of weakness, concerns over the ability of the world's top oil companies to boost shareholder returns compound worries about the sector as investors shun independent oil and gas producers, particularly U.S. shale firms.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) analyst Martijn Rats said he now assumed the buyback programme would be completed a year later than planned.

Given the economic environment and expected decline in cash generation, Shell will be able to cover its $15 billion dividend commitment from its operations, leaving little room for buybacks and debt reduction, Rats said.

Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said Shell's ""management credibility has now been strained"". Gammel retained his ""buy"" recommendation on Shell, ""with somewhat less enthusiasm"".

Shell shares were up 0.6% at 1325 GMT.

U.S. rivals Exxon and Chevron (N: ) both reported sharp drops in third-quarter profits on Friday.

(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will decide in the next two days whether there’s enough support from local investors to finally go ahead with the initial public offering of state oil producer Aramco.

Aramco is preparing to announce its intention to float on Sunday, according to people familiar with the matter. The final decision will be made by Prince Mohammed after he hears feedback from bankers who’ve been pitching the deal to investors in Saudi Arabia and beyond, the people said, asking not to be named discussing private deliberations.

“It will be a Saudi decision, first and foremost; specifically, Prince Mohammed’s decision,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Saudi energy minister and the crown prince’s half-brother, said earlier this week.

An earlier plan to kick off the share sale in mid-October was shelved after international money managers balked at the $2 trillion valuation the crown prince has placed on the world’s largest oil producer.

Aramco executives held meetings with investors in London and New York over the last week, but there are few signs they are ready to pay the valuation Prince Mohammed has insisted on since 2016. If the IPO goes ahead now, it’s likely to rely heavily on money from within the kingdom.

The richest Saudi families, many of whom had members held in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel during 2017’s corruption crackdown, have been pressed to commit large sums to the IPO, people with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing private conversations.

Local asset managers, including those looking after government funds, have also been asked to make significant contributions, while domestic banks have been told to lend generously so retail investors can buy Aramco shares, the people said.

Whether that’s sufficient to get the valuation to $2 trillion remains to be seen. The prince may need to be satisfied with a figure closer to $1.7 billion, if he wants the deal to go ahead, people said.

For Prince Mohammed, getting the IPO done may be more important than achieving the valuation he initially put forward, for two reasons. First, Saudi Arabia is selling a tiny stake -- probably around 2% -- so he isn’t leaving too much money on the table by accepting a lower valuation.

Second, what happens after the IPO may matter more because the ups-and-downs of the share price will be a barometer of the Saudi economy and a successful IPO now opens the door to further sales.

“It’s very important to make sure it’s a successful IPO, where success is defined as a material price increase after flotation. Maximizing shareholder return at this stage is very secondary,” Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator with links to the government, said on Twitter. “Also if large numbers of Saudi retail investors participate, as is expected, it’s essential to guarantee them a good return.”

Riyadh still has ambitions to sell Aramco shares on an international exchange -- bankers have talked about London, New York and Tokyo as possibilities -- and the initial 1-2% stake IPO may be a first step in future sales. In 2016, Prince Mohammed said he wanted to sell about 5% of the company.

Even at a valuation of $1.5 trillion, the IPO would be gigantic. That would still create the world’s largest publicly traded company, far outstripping Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., the only two worth more than $1 trillion today.

It would also almost certainly mean a record share sale: selling 2% of Aramco’s equity would yield $30 billion for Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, surpassing the $25 billion raised by China’s Alibaba (NYSE: ) Group Holding Ltd. in 2014.

A successful sale is key to Prince Mohammed’s Vision 2030 plan to overhaul the Saudi economy and end the kingdom’s reliance on oil exports. The proceeds from the IPO will boost the firepower of the OPEC nation’s sovereign wealth fund, which already has investments in funds managed by Blackstone (NYSE: ) Group LP and SoftBank Group Corp.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: )., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) & Co. and the other Wall Street giants advising Aramco haven’t given up on luring international investors to the IPO. At management meetings with fund managers in London and New York last week, the reception was mixed, according to people who attended the meetings.

Some investors saw the potential of switching their oil investments to Aramco, where rock-bottom production costs mean they’re likely to outlast less efficient producers as the world shifts away from fossil fuels. But others remain skeptical that Aramco deserves a valuation that would put their dividend yields below established public oil majors like Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ).

The company is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholder’s choosing, Aramco said in a statement.

If Prince Mohammed decides to give the go-ahead, trading in Aramco stock will start on the Saudi Stock Exchange, the Tadawul, on Dec. 11, according to Al-Arabiya. By the end of 2019, the world’s most valuable company will no longer be listed in New York, but in Riyadh.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/aramco-ipo-waits-on-crown-prince-as-saudi-rich-pressed-to-invest-1989868,0.01,0.865,0.124,0.9988

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco officials and advisers are holding last-minute meetings with investors in an attempt to achieve as close to a $2 trillion (£1.55 trillion) valuation ahead of an expected Sunday announcement that the initial public offering (IPO) will go ahead, according to three sources.

Failure to reach the target would cause a dilemma for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - swallow the bitter pill of going ahead at a lower valuation or postpone the initial public offering (IPO) once again.

The Aramco officials and advisers are meeting institutional investors around the world, according to the three people familiar with the matter. Chief executive Amin Nasser has been meeting investors in New York and London this week, they added.

Saudi Arabia's crown prince on Friday approved the go ahead of the IPO of state oil giant Aramco, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The main sticking point remains the $2 trillion valuation, which has often been considered too ambitious by advisers and some insiders, according to the three sources. A valuation closer to $1.5 trillion is more likely, with wealthy Saudi families the main investors in the IPO, they said.

""Saudi Aramco does not comment on rumours or speculations,"" the company said in an emailed response to Reuters' queries about the meetings and IPO launch date. Aramco added it was ready for the IPO, and that the timing would depend on market conditions.

Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz said on Wednesday that it would be a Saudi decision, specifically by Crown Prince Mohammed.

A weak outlook for oil prices, against a gloomy global economic picture and increasing climate change activism, could dampen investor interest, particularly in the Western world.

""Aramco's officials and advisers are still on the road,"" said one of the sources, a major institutional investor.

Saudi Arabia is separately still holding government-to-government meetings to attract investment from sovereign wealth funds, the investor added.

The state-owned oil major has also approached governments in the Gulf and Asia, including China, to try to secure the bulk of the investment from countries on friendly terms with Saudi Arabia, as the reception elsewhere has been cooler, sources have previously said.

DIVIDEND PAYOUT

The listing is the centrepiece of the crown prince's plan to shake up the Saudi economy and diversify away from oil. But there have been various delays since the 2016 announcement. A launch is now expected on Sunday, sources have previously said.

Aramco has said it will pay a base dividend of $75 billion, which at $2 trillion would mean a dividend yield of 3.75%, below those already offered by competitors like Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ).

Shell's dividend yield is over 6% and Exxon's over 5%, according to Refinitiv data.

Oil majors have been raising payouts to shareholders over the past years to counter rising pressure from climate activism on investors to dump oil stocks and help the world switch to cleaner fuels such as wind and solar.

To achieve $2 trillion, in the largest IPO in history, Riyadh needs the initial listing of a 1% to 2% stake on the Saudi market to raise at least $20 billion to $40 billion.

Prince Mohammed wants to eventually list a total of 5% of the company. An international sale is expected to follow the domestic IPO.

The close relationship between new Aramco chairman Yasser al-Rumayyan, who also heads the PIF, the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, with the crown prince was a governance concern of some investors, the sources said.

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will reportedly spend the weekend musing on whether to finally pull the trigger on the world’s biggest, and most elusive, IPO. At this point, it’s impossible to say if he will finally give the thumbs up for Saudi Aramco’s debut. Yet he may take some encouragement from a Big Oil earnings week that has been, to use the old euphemism, mixed.

All but one of the big five — BP Plc, Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: )., Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Total SA (PA: ) — beat earnings estimates (and even Chevron’s miss owed much to a one-off tax charge). On the other hand, analysts spent the summer lowering the bar, so the companies all won in the way all the kids win at Saturday morning soccer.

All that really matters is how much cash they’re generating and what they’re doing with it. And it’s here that things got mixed, even garbled at times — and which might provide Saudi Arabian Oil Co. an opening.

All five oil majors covered capital expenditure from internal cash flow, and all except Exxon covered dividends too. Beyond this, only Chevron and Shell have buyback programs of any appreciable size; and of the two, Chevron was able to cover that from operating cash flow.

Not bad, but problems lurked for most. Exxon’s continuing out-of-sync upswing in capex, while bearing fruit in Guyana and elsewhere, leaves it borrowing to cover dividends for now. Chevron’s numbers were much more in tune with what oil investors demand these days. However, cost inflation in its Tengiz expansion project in Kazakhstan provided an unwelcome reminder of the bad old days, when hefty capex bills pushed free cash flow sharply into the red. Chevron didn’t raise its annual capex budget, though.

Over in Europe, Total delivered a solid quarter, adding credibility to its recent dividend increase. The biggest stumbles came from Shell and BP (LON: ), and their stocks were punished swiftly. Both fumbled a recalibration of investor expectations around payouts. BP was forced to clarify it hadn’t yet decided on dividends after its CFO suggested on the earnings call that a much-anticipated increase might have to wait until next year. Shell, meanwhile, distributed almost as much cash as Chevron and Exxon combined last quarter. But it ended up hosting a largely defensive analyst call after saying a weaker economic outlook could cause it to slow buybacks next year.

Shell’s drubbing was perhaps the most ominous. We expect investors to revolt if dividends are frozen or suspended. In this case, they threw up their hands at an oil major slowing prospective buybacks due to deteriorating macro conditions. If the industry needed any reminding their owners remain laser-focused on extracting more cash from them, then this provided it.

This is Aramco’s potential opportunity. I am skeptical of both the likelihood of MBS getting his desired $2 trillion valuation and even its utility. Why simultaneously cap the potential gains of ordinary Saudi shareholders and create a country-sized shorting opportunity? But recent moves to reduce Aramco’s royalty rates and to guarantee dividend payments to minorities for five years show its bankers have gotten the message from potential investors.

It is worth remembering Aramco’s IPO is in itself a sign that oil’s growth prospects are dimming. This is a big reason why energy stocks are so out of favor, with weighting in the stock market at historic lows. In all likelihood, therefore, if and when Aramco does come to market, a significant proportion of international investors deciding to buy will do so via reallocation from existing energy or emerging-market portfolio holdings, rather than injecting a lot of new money. Much as Riyadh likes to think of Aramco as being in a class of its own, it will have to compete for interest like any other oil major once it dips a toe into the public equity market.

The flip side is that the gravitational pull of an Aramco IPO presents a hazard for the oil majors, which, in this light, represent pools of capital to draw upon. That isn’t to say someone holding Exxon is bound to redeploy toward Aramco’s stock, given their differing risk profiles. But some is bound to leak away, and Aramco’s emphasis on payouts is a powerful counterargument set against these recent results. Of the five, Shell and BP look most at risk given their mixed messages on dividends next year and relatively high leverage. But Exxon, too, may struggle to prevent defections given high spending and a lack of buybacks.

Having also worked quickly to calm nerves after September’s missile attacks on its facilities, Aramco has also suppressed the higher oil prices that would bolster bigger payouts by its western rivals next year. The prince’s inexplicable fixation on that $2 trillion number may yet delay the IPO once more. But in competing for the relatively limited pool of dollars targeting energy these days, this week’s earnings from Aramco’s rivals provides good reasons to make a move.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/big-oil-earnings-provide-an-opening-for-aramco-1990071,0.064,0.824,0.112,0.9927

(Bloomberg) -- A sell-off across global bond markets deepened after further signs that trade tensions between the U.S. and China may be easing.

Japanese bonds, U.S. Treasuries and European securities all slumped as the potential removal of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods revived optimism over the economic outlook. In Europe, where sovereign yields have hit record lows this year on fears of recession, French rates climbed to near positive territory for the first time since July.

For some, the bond declines bear a resemblance to the market “tantrum” of 2015, when German borrowing costs soared after the European Central Bank indicated it wouldn’t cut rates further. This time around, the Federal Reserve has played a similar role, signaling that it is taking a pause, while Australia’s central bank held rates Tuesday and Sweden’s Riksbank is determined to hike by the end of the year.

“It is starting to smell a bit like the sell-off in the spring of 2015, but it is actually easier to put some factors behind it this time,” said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, head of fixed-income research at Danske Bank A/S. “Pricing is no longer for lower rates and momentum has shifted.”

If so, it would mark a major turnaround for bond markets that have been dominated by growing demand for haven securities -- such as U.S. Treasuries and German bunds -- as well as a hunt for yields. That has seen investors dive into riskier assets such as Italian and Greek bonds.

French 10-year yields rose three basis points to -0.01%, the highest since July. Those on similar-dated U.S. Treasuries climbed four basis points to 1.82%, with trading running at around 160% of the recent average. In Japan, 10-year yields rose five basis points to -0.12% as the Bank of Japan cut debt purchases for the first time in more than a month, and in a catch-up move following a public holiday Monday.

Investors also showed signs of struggling to digest a deluge of supply, including $38 billion of U.S. three-year notes, German inflation-linked securities and a euro-denominated bond from China on Tuesday. In corporate debt, more than 20 tranches are hitting the European market, including from Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LON: ), making it the busiest day of issuance since at least mid-September.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/global-bond-selloff-on-china-trade-thaw-revives-tantrum-fears-1991535,0.073,0.838,0.089,0.5647

(Reuters) - Gains for oil company shares pushed London's FTSE 100 into the black on Tuesday, helped by a prediction that OPEC would supply a shrinking portion of global supply, while Primark owner Associated British Foods (L: ) jumped 5% after strong results.

The FTSE 100 ( ) gained 0.2% by 0810 GMT, hovering close to a one-month high it touched in the previous session, while the mid-cap index ( ) was 0.1% higher.

Oil majors Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ), which fell last week after reporting falls in profit, were the biggest boost to the main index, opening higher and extending gains after OPEC said it expected to supply a diminishing amount of oil in the next five years in the face of competition from U.S. shale and other rival sources.

A.B.Foods (L: ) headed for its best day in more than 10 months after it posted higher annual earnings and said it was well-positioned for further earnings growth in the new year.

Hopes that Washington and Beijing were on course to sign some form of trade deal continued to help the index.

LONDON (Reuters) - Darkening clouds over the global economy have led two of the world's top oil firms to warn investors that promised growth in returns could be at risk for the first time since the 2014 oil downturn.

Both BP (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), which account for nearly 15% of the FTSE's total dividends, signalled this week that billions of dollars in shareholder returns could be delayed as oil prices failed to make their expected recovery.

The stark warnings led to sharp drops in the shares of both companies, weakening investors' appetite for the oil and gas sector which has underperformed most other industries in recent years.

They echo, however, a growing trend across the Atlantic where investors are starving U.S. shale companies of new capital after they largely failed to deliver returns after flooding the market with oil and gas in recent years.

To be sure, the bearish outlook overshadowed a steady and significant improvement in Shell and BP's performance since 2014 as deep cost cuts and thrifty spending sharply boosted revenues despite a modest and volatile recovery in oil prices.

Most of the world's top oil companies can make profits at oil prices of $50 to $60 a barrel. Oil is currently trading at around $60 a barrel.

But the companies still heavily rely on stronger oil and gas prices to deliver higher returns.

""Our outlook is tied to an improved price and margin environment,"" Shell Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl told reporters on a call, adding that she saw ""clear signals"" of slower economic activity in 2019 and 2020 than expected.

Shell, the second largest but the most profitable listed oil and gas company last year after U.S. ExxonMobil (NYSE: ), is in the midst of a three-year $25 billion share buyback programme, the world's biggest.

But ""the current conditions aren't meeting where we said they needed to be, and if that continues into 2020 then we will need to extend the time period"" for the buybacks, Uhl said.

Shell's shares were down over 3.5% by 1042 GMT.

Earlier this year the Anglo-Dutch company also promised to return $125 billion to shareholders between 2021 and 2025.

""The question for management is what is more important – does the company continue on the current run rate and sacrifice the balance sheet? Or does the company slow the buyback in order to maintain a robust balance sheet. Common sense suggests the balance sheet is much more important,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria, said in a note.

Borkhataria, who has a ""sector perform"" recommendation on the stock, said that Shell requires an additional $30 billion in buybacks after 2020 in order to reduce the dividend burden.

BP Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary on Tuesday told Reuters that trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's largest energy consumers, are weighing on global oil and gas demand.

Gilvary indicated in an analyst call that the London-listed company could delay an expected increase to its dividend by the end of this year to next year, linking it to the changing of CEOs in March.

""We'll certainly discuss it at 4Q, but it's more likely it will be beyond that,"" Gilvary said. BP's shares dropped by 3.8% on Tuesday.

The promise of bigger returns comes as the oil and gas sector faces increasing pressure from investors to tackle its carbon emissions and fall in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement targets to limit global warming.

Some investment funds have dropped oil stocks from their portfolio all together, prompting oil firms to respond by pledging higher returns.

France's Total, which has emerged as one of the fastest growing oil majors in recent quarters in terms of output, has confirmed its commitment to boost the payout.

Total increased its 2019 dividend by 6% and the board has committed to increase it by a further 5% to 6% per year until 2025.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/big-oil-investors-face-returns-reckoning-amid-darkening-economy-1989033,0.049,0.83,0.121,0.9938

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ) Chief Executive Rex Tillerson is expected to take the stand on Wednesday in a closely watched civil lawsuit accusing the company of hiding the true cost of climate change from investors.

The case in Manhattan state court, which kicked off last week, is the first of several lawsuits pending against major oil companies related to climate change to go to trial.

The lawsuit, brought by New York's attorney general, alleges that Exxon falsely told investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business using a “proxy cost” of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions, but internally used figures as low as $40 per ton or none at all.

It says Exxon caused investors to lose up to $1.6 billion.

Exxon has assailed the claims as false and politically motivated.

In his opening statement, Theodore Wells, a lawyer for the company, said that after Tillerson became chief executive in 2006, the company put in place a “robust system” to manage the risk of increasing climate change. Tillerson served as Exxon CEO from 2006 to 2017, and U.S. secretary of state under President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2018.

Wells said the $80 per ton proxy cost represented a ""global,"" ""macro-level"" assessment of the cost, while lower figures, known as greenhouse gas or GHG costs, were used for particular capital projects depending on circumstances. He said Exxon never told investors the two numbers were the same.

Last Thursday, just two days after the New York trial began, Massachusetts filed a similar lawsuit accusing Exxon of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role fossil fuels play in climate change.

Both Massachusetts and New York began investigating Exxon after news reports in 2015 saying that its own scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.

Those reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.

Exxon and other oil companies including BP Plc (L: ), Chevron Corp (N: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) face lawsuits by cities and counties across the United States seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change.

Investing.com -- Here's a roundup of regulatory news releases from the London Stock Exchange on Thursday, 31st October. Please refresh for updates.

(LON: ) swung to a net loss of 238 million pounds ($305 million) after taking a 1.8 billion charge for PPI mis-selling, at the top of the likely range it announced earlier. As with its major rivals, the charge ought to draw a line under a decade-long problem.

Revenue fell 2% on the year against a backdrop of lower interest rates but costs fell 5%, and it now expects its cost-income ratio to fall from last year’s level.

The bank warned that continued economic uncertainty could further hurt the outlook, but pointed to the fact that even in the current weak conditions, it had generated 75 basis points of capital in the quarter before the PPI hit.

Separately, it announced that chief operating officer Juan Colombas will retire in July 2020.

(LON: )said earnings on a current cost of supplies basis, its preferred measure of profit, rose 9% on the year in the third quarter to $6.08 billion, thanks to ""very strong trading and optimization results.""

Underlying CCS earnings fell 15% on the year to $4.77 billion.

It kept its quarterly dividend unchanged at 47 cents and upheld its intention to buy back $25 billion in shares, but CEO Ben van Beurden admitted that the timeframe for meeting its gearing target may slip due to the weak global economy.

""The prevailing weak macroeconomic conditions and challenging outlook inevitably create uncertainty about the pace of reducing gearing to 25% and completing the share buyback programme within the 2020 timeframe,"" van Beurden said. Shell (LON: ) follows BP (LON: ) in warning that the economic slowdown could stop its cutting debt as planned.

BT Group (LON: ) said revenue fell 1% in the first half of its fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, “mainly reflecting the impact of regulation, declines in legacy products, and strategically reducing low margin business.” Regulation contributed to a 5.5% drop in average revenue per customer on postpaid plans, as did the general trend to customers seeking SIM-only deals. Profit before tax was flat at 1.33 billion pounds, while underlying EBITDA fell 3% to 3.92 billion.

The rollout of 5G services continues as scheduled and has now reached over 20 cities and large towns.

The interim dividend was unchanged at 4.62 pence a share and the company maintained its previous outlook.

Medical device group Smith & Nephew (LON: ) raised its revenue guidance for the year after posting 4% organic revenue growth in the .

However, it indicated full-year profit margins would be at, or even below, the low end of the announced range. It cut margin guidance to “around 22.8%” from a range of 22.8% to 23.2%.

Overall revenue grew 6.5% as 390 basis points benefit of acquisitions outweighed 140 basis points of currency headwind. Recently acquired Osiris posted anpther quarter of growth over 10%, while emerging market revenues grew “in the mid-teens” thanks to strong sales in China.

Packaging group (LON: ) upheld its guidance for the full year in a pre-closing statement for the first half of its 2020 fiscal year that didn't include hard figures.

The company said it expects ""good margin progression...consistent with the upgraded target of 10% to 12% return on sales.""

It said its new U.S. plant in Indiana will be operational by the end of the year, lowering its dependence on lower-margin exports.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/premarket-london-lloyds-swings-to-q3-loss-shell-has-strong-quarter-1988718,0.08,0.818,0.103,0.9487

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc (NYSE: ) continued the industry trend of comfortably beating profit estimates, while also warning investors that returns might be less generous than they had hoped.

Shell’s adjusted net income for the third quarter was well above even the highest analyst estimate as its integrated gas and oil trading churned out cash. However, the energy giant warned that the pace of share buybacks could slow due to “prevailing weak macroeconomic conditions.”

It’s a performance that echoes Shell’s closest rival BP (LON: ) Plc, which also posted better-than-expected earnings but disappointed shareholders hoping for a dividend increase. The third quarter was a difficult period for energy producers, with crude prices sinking over worries about the economic impact of the U.S.-China trade war while markets are enduring a long stretch of oversupply.

“Our earnings reflect the resilience of our market-facing businesses and their ability to capitalize on market conditions, including very strong trading and optimization results this quarter,” Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in a statement. “Our intention to buy back $25 billion in shares and reduce net debt remains unchanged,” but there’s some uncertainty over whether it will be completed within the 2020 timeframe, he said.

Shell said adjusted net income was $4.77 billion in the quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.92 billion. That compares to profit of $5.62 billion in the same period last year, and improves on a surprisingly weak second quarter.

Cash flow from operations including working capital, perhaps the single most important measure for Shell as it aims to distribute $125 billion to shareholders between 2021 and 2025, was $12.25 billion, little changed from a year earlier and beating analyst estimates gathered by Shell of $11.5 billion.

Shell had warned in its first ever pre-earnings “quarterly update” that upstream production would probably dip slightly from a year earlier, though the impact of the decline may be offset by a strong performance in its market-leading liquefied natural gas trading business.

The company decided to disclose more information before publishing its results following complaints its earnings were too volatile to predict. In the first quarter of 2019, it beat analyst estimates by 14%, then missed them by 28% the following quarter.

Shell’s peers also made one-time disclosures this quarter to flag bearish news. BP Plc beat estimates on Tuesday but only after analysts downgraded them by about 35% after the company flagged a $2.61 billion impairment charge. Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: )., which reports earnings on Friday, said it will take a $400 million to $700 million hit from lower oil prices.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-beats-profit-estimates-warns-of-slower-share-buyback-1988747,0.108,0.788,0.104,-0.7293

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) warned on Thursday that uncertain economic conditions could slow its $25 billion (£19.31 billion) share buyback programme, the world's largest, after its third-quarter profits easily beat expectations on strong oil and gas trading.

The better-than-expected results in the face of oil prices that fell 17% year on year underscores Shell's transformation in recent years, with deep cost cuts and a focus on returns after the 2014 industry downturn.

Yet slowing demand for oil and gas around the world amid trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's two largest energy consumers, could take a toll, Shell said.

Shell shares were down by around 4% at 1057 GMT, compared with a 1% decline in the FTSE index ( ).

CEO Ben van Beurden said in a statement that Shell's intention to buy back $25 billion of shares by the end of next year remains unchanged.

He nevertheless said that ""the prevailing weak macroeconomic conditions and challenging outlook inevitably create uncertainty about the pace of reducing gearing to 25% and completing the share buyback programme within the 2020 timeframe.""

Its gearing, or net debt as a percentage of total capital, rose to 27.9% from 27.6% in the previous quarter.

The Anglo-Dutch company, the world's biggest dividend payer at $16 billion a year, plans to boost payouts to investors through dividends and share buybacks to $125 billion between 2021 and 2025.

Shell has acquired $12 billion worth of shares since July 2018 and announced on Thursday it had started the next tranche of buybacks of up to $2.75 billion by Jan. 27, 2020.

On Tuesday, rival BP (L: ) indicated that its plans to boost its dividend by the end of this year could be delayed, partly due to the changing of CEOs as well as the weak economic background.

""The lack of a dividend hike at BP and Shell management hinting at a possibly slower pace of share buybacks are suggesting companies are taking a more sober view on the outlook for oil and gas prices,"" Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) analyst Martijn Rats said.

STRONG TRADING

Net income attributable to shareholders, based on a current cost of supplies (CCS) and excluding identified items, fell 15% to $4.8 billion from a year earlier.

That topped the $3.91 billion expected by analysts in a company-provided survey.

The fall was offset by strong performance of Shell's liquefied (LNG) trading operations as well as trading related to pending 2020 changes to marine fuel standards, Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl told reporters.

""This quarter we continued to deliver strong cash flow and earnings, despite sustained lower oil and gas prices, and chemicals margins,"" van Beurden said.

Oil and gas production in the quarter fell by 1% from a year earlier to 3.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

Cash flow from operations, seen by many as the main metric for the company's performance, rose to $12.25 billion from $8.63 billion in the second quarter and from $12.1 billion a year earlier.

Uhl said that the weaker economic environment in the second and third quarters of 2019 impacted Shell's cashflow by around $5 billion compared to the previous year.

Free cash flow, or cash available to pay for dividends and share buybacks, rose to $10.1 billion from $8 billion a year earlier.

Rivals BP (L: ) and Total (L: ) both reported sharp drops in profits in the quarter as a result of lower oil and gas prices.

Investing.com -- They loved it yesterday, but Peugeot (PA: ) shareholders are revolting at the thought of the merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI: ) now that the terms have been announced.

Shares in the French auto group fell over 10% in early trading Thursday after the two companies announced what they called a merger of equals which would create the world's fourth-largest automotive group with annual revenues of around 170 billion euros ($190 billion). It would see Peugeot boss Carlos Tavares installed as chief executive, with FCA's John Elkann as chairman of a board that would have six directors nominated by the French group and five by the Italian one.

The reaction suggests that shareholders were unprepared for an assessment that ascribes relatively more value to FCA's Jeep, Maseratis and Alfa Romeo brands than to the French group's dowdier Peugeot and Citroen marques (even after a 5.5 billion euro special dividend paid out to FCA shareholders).

The group estimates it could squeeze out 3.7 billion euros a year in annual synergies, thanks to ""more efficient allocation of resources for large-scale investments in vehicle platforms, powertrain and technology and from the enhanced purchasing capability inherent in the combined group’s new scale."" Four-fifths of those extra efficiencies would be realized within four years, it said.

The most intriguing line of the release then followed: ""These synergy estimates are not based on any plant closures.""

The two companies are making no promises as regards the one measure that would really enhance profitability, expecting fierce pushback from both the French and Italian governments if they try to close any plants. That's despite the fact that the global car market - and the European one in particular - has been dogged by overcapacity all through a boom that ended years ago. EU car sales peaked in 2000.

There's also some intriguing knock-on effects. Fiat Chrysler will hand over to shareholders its shares in its robot-making unit Comau, while Peugeot will distribute to its shareholders its 46% stake in auto-part maker Faurecia (PA: ). Faurecia shareholders didn't take kindly to the idea of a big strategic stake suddenly being dumped in the open market in dribs and drabs, and pushed the stock down 4.0%.

Elsewhere on Thursday, stocks were broadly lower after the Federal Reserve signaled there would probably be no more interest rate cuts this year, after cutting the target range for Fed funds by 25 basis points, as expected.

The benchmark fell 0.4%, while the German was down 0.5% while the U.K. was down 0.7%, hit by heavyweights Lloyds Banking Group (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ).

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 lagged its European counterparts on Thursday as disappointing earnings reports from heavyweights Shell and Lloyds took investor focus away from the U.S. Federal Reserve's third interest rate cut this year.

The main index ( ) gave up 0.3%, with its most valued company, Shell (L: ), dropping 3.2% after profits plunged and it warned that uncertain economic conditions could slow its $25 billion share buyback.

The domestically focussed FTSE 250 ( ) added 0.1% by 0838 GMT, though Crest Nicholson (L: ) dropped more than 7% after warning its annual profit could plunge by as much as a third.

Crest highlighted hits from weak consumer confidence and flattening prices as a result of Brexit nerves, and shares of blue-chip housebuilders Persimmon (L: ), Barratt (L: ) and Berkeley (L: ) lost about 1% each.

Lloyds (L: ), another blue-chip component, shed 2.2% after missing market expectations for third-quarter earnings.

The FTSE 100 is set to post a loss for only the third month this year as a rally in sterling amid a flurry of Brexit updates - most notably the risk of a 'no-deal' exit subsiding - has hurt exporter stocks in October.

The mid-cap index is on course for its second straight month of gains and investors now brace for a general election in December.

Corporate headlines diverted attention, and perhaps sentiment, away from the Fed's widely-expected interest rate cut. The U.S. central bank did however signal that the latest policy action would be the last for some time.

""That takes December of the table, and we may well see no action until well into Q2 next year if at all. The 'insurance cut' as Chairman Powell put it, makes complete sense in this context,"" OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said.

Gains among mid-caps were led by specialist media services firm Future Plc (L: ) that jumped 11.5% to its highest since December 2000, following a proposed acquisition of UK-based print and digital magazine publisher TI Media.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) still sees abundant opportunity to make money from oil and gas in coming decades even as investors and governments increase pressure on energy companies over climate change, its chief executive said.

But in an interview with Reuters, Ben van Beurden expressed concern that some shareholders could abandon the world's second-largest listed energy company due partly to what he called the ""demonisation"" of oil and gas and ""unjustified"" worries that its business model was unsustainable.

The 61-year-old Dutch executive in recent years became one of the sector's most prominent voices advocating action over global warming in the wake of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

Shell, which supplies around 3% of the world's energy, set out in 2017 a plan to halve the intensity of its greenhouse emissions by the middle of the century, based in large part on building one of the world's biggest power businesses.

Still, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from Shell's operations and the products it sells rose by 2.5% between 2017 and 2018.

A defiant van Beurden rejected a rising chorus from climate activists and parts of the investor community to transform radically the 112-year-old Anglo-Dutch company's traditional business model.

""Despite what a lot of activists say, it is entirely legitimate to invest in oil and gas because the world demands it,"" van Beurden said.

""We have no choice"" but to invest in long-life projects, he added.

Shell and its peers have long insisted that switching away from oil and gas to cleaner sources of energy will take decades as demand for transport and plastics continues to grow. Investors have warned, however, that oil companies often rely on forecasts that underestimate the pace of change.

Shell plans to greenlight more than 35 new oil and gas projects by 2025, according to an investor presentation from June.

Oil and gas remain the backbone of profits for Shell, the largest listed company on London's main FTSE index ( ).

While oil and gas account for the entirety of Shell's free cashflow today, it foresees a gradual diversification over the next two decades. Oil and gas are each still expected to provide a third of free cashflow, however, with the rest coming from power and chemicals.

Many oil and gas projects such as gas-processing plants, deepwater platforms or chemical plants take billions of dollars to develop and operate for decades.

""RED HERRING""

Shell, like many rivals, has become more selective in its investments as the outlook for oil prices and demand remains unclear. It targets new projects that can be profitable at oil prices of $20 to $30 a barrel and which emit relatively low greenhouse emissions. Oil is trading at around $60 a barrel.

""We can sustain an upstream portfolio all the way into the 2030s if there is an economic rationale for doing that and a societal rationale for doing that,"" van Beurden said.

""Fortunately enough, we have more of those than we have money to spend on them.""

Van Beurden rejected as a ""red herring"" arguments that Shell's oil and gas reserves, which can sustain its current production for around eight years, would be economically unviable, or stranded, in the future.

A lack of investment in oil and gas projects could lead to a supply shortage and result in price spikes, he said.

""One of the bigger risks is not so much that we will become dinosaurs because we are still investing in oil and gas when there is no need for it anymore. A bigger risk is prematurely turning your back on oil and gas.""

Shell plans to increase its annual spending to around $32 billion by 2025 from the current $25 billion, with up to one tenth allocated to renewables and the power business.

The company, the world's largest dividend payer, plans to return $125 billion to shareholders in the five years to 2025.

On liquefied , of which Shell is the world's biggest trader, van Beurden said the market would exhibit oversupply in the near term. ""But (LNG) demand will continue to grow at a pace that is roughly four times that of oil,"" he said.

Shell has become a focal point of environmental protests, particularly in Europe, with regular demonstrations outside its London headquarters and the British National Theatre dropping Shell's sponsorship in recent months.

At the same time, investors have sharply increased their scrutiny of companies' environmental performance.

Amid growing uncertainty over future demand, the share prices of Shell and its peers have underperformed relative to other sectors.

Van Beurden expressed concern that some investors could ditch Shell, acknowledging that shares in the company were trading at a discount partly due to ""societal risk"".

""I am afraid of that, to be honest,"" he said.

""But I don't think they will flee for the justified concern of stranded assets ... (It is) the continued pressure on our sector, in some cases to the point of demonisation, that scares asset managers.""

""It is not at a scale that the alarm bells are ringing, but it is an unhealthy trend.""

Van Beurden put the onus for achieving a transformation to low-carbon economies on governments, warning that not enough progress had been made to reach the Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century.

""Can that happen? I think it can ... Increasingly society is not putting up with the fact we are not making enough progress.""

Delaying implementation of the right climate policies could result in ""knee-jerk"" political responses that might be very disruptive to society, he said.

""Let the air out of the balloon as soon as you can before the balloon actually bursts,"" van Beurden said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Greenpeace activists boarded two Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) oil platforms in the British North Sea on Monday in protest against plans to leave parts of the giant structures in place after production shuts down.

Pictures provided by Greenpeace show two people in yellow hats scaling one of two giant, rusty structures and unfurling a banner reading ""Clean up your mess, Shell!""

Shell confirmed that protesters boarded the Alpha platform and the Brent Bravo concrete legs.

Shell is in the process of dismantling the 40-year-old Brent field east of the Shetland islands, in what is known as decommissioning, as its oil and gas reserves dwindle after producing more than 500,000 barrels a day at their peak in the 1980s.

The field, a 50-50 joint venture with Exxon Mobil (N: ), includes four platforms, a myriad of subsea platforms and over 150 wells.

Shell plans to remove all the platforms and is currently seeking approval from the British government to leave in place their bases - huge concrete and steel legs that each weigh dozens of tonnes.

""The UK government cannot claim to be a global oceans champion while allowing Shell to dump thousands of tonnes of oil waste in the North Sea,"" Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist, said in a statement.

""If ministers allow Shell to bend the rules, this will set a dangerous precedent for the decommissioning of hundreds of ageing North Sea platforms in the coming years.""

Shell says it has held extensive consultations and conducted dozens of studies over its plans in recent years and has concluded that leaving the legs in place was the safest environmental solution.

The plans will be discussed at a meeting on Friday of the OSPAR Commission, which groups 15 governments in protecting the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic.

Both the Dutch and German governments have voiced concerns over Shell's plans.

The approval however lies in the hands of Britain's department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).

""Our proposals were submitted only when we were convinced they were the best option: safe, environmentally sound, technically achievable, and socially responsible,"" Shell said in a statement.

(Bloomberg) -- An auction next month of oilfields in Brazil may be the priciest ever held, raising at least $50 billion in licensing fees and compensation, according to people familiar with government estimates.

Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: )., Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and other energy giants are set to vie for deep-sea deposits that could hold 15 billion barrels of oil, almost twice as much as Norway’s reserves. Winners at the Nov. 6 auction are expected to pay $25 billion in licensing fees, plus share a portion of their production with the government.

In addition, bidders will need to negotiate payments to state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA for investments it has already made in the area. Those payments could add another $25 billion to $45 billion in costs, according to officials familiar with government figures who asked not to be named because the information is private.

The auction is unique in part because one of the four areas being offered is already gushing more than half of the daily output from Venezuela. It’s a rare opportunity for an industry more accustomed to exploring riskier offshore prospects that can take a decade or more to develop.

Fourteen producers -- including Petrobras -- have signed up to participate in the auction.

Petrobras didn’t respond to requests for comment. The Brazilian oil regulator, known as ANP, declined to comment on the total amount the auction could raise. It said payments to Petrobras will be negotiated between the company and its partners, without government interference.

The offerings are at the heart of the pre-salt, a giant expanse of oil deposits about the size of Ohio trapped beneath a layer of salt under the Atlantic seabed. The four prospects -- Buzios, Itapu, Sepia and Atapu -- are estimated to hold as much as 15 billion barrels of recoverable crude, according to a study by Houston-based consultancy Gaffney, Cline & Associates.

Buzios is already Brazil’s second-largest field by production, with output of about 425,000 barrels a day -- at a time when Venezuelan production is running at 700,000. It has four platforms that are tapping about a dozen wells, with room for other wells to be drilled and the current ones to be ramped up further.

Payment Terms

Brazil’s federal audit court estimates the compensation to Brazil’s oil company could reach $45 billion under proposed guidelines. It has recommended the government lower certain parameters like the estimated price of to make the deals more attractive, according to the people familiar. The court’s estimates and recommendations for the sale are confidential.

The Brazilian Petroleum Institute, an industry group that represents some of the bidders, estimates the payments to Petrobras will be worth between 120 billion and 130 billion reais ($29 billion-$31 billion). A study by Wood Mackenzie Ltd. released Monday estimates $24 billion.

The rules do not specify how the payments to Petrobras should be settled. A combination of cash, crude and investments over many years is a possibility. Licenses last for three decades. Winning bidders will have 18 months to reach an agreement with Petrobras before the oil regulator is required to step in as mediator.

As for the licensing payments, the largest chunk of the $25 billion will be due this year and the remainder in 2020, all in cash.

(Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 250 slid on Thursday after Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) cast doubts on the prospects of a Brexit deal, while shares of building materials suppliers and homebuilders tumbled after Grafton's profit alert.

The FTSE 250 ( ), up more than 3% since last week amid a flurry of contrasting Brexit headlines, shed 0.5% as sterling slipped after the DUP said it could not back the Brexit deal as it currently stands.

The FTSE 100 ( ) snapped a three-day losing run and edged 0.2% higher by 0800 GMT, helped by a rebound in oil majors Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) after days of sell-off.

Unilever (L: ) added 1.5% after its quarterly update and, along with fellow exporter firms, benefited from a weaker pound to further support the main index.

Mid-cap Grafton (L: ) slid 12%, on track for its worst day since June 2016, after it warned on its annual profit due to weak demand in the UK and delays in new construction permits in the Netherlands.

Peers Travis Perkins (L: ), Howden Joinery (L: ) and SIG (L: ) gave up between 2% and 5.4%.

Housebuilders such as Barratt (L: ), Taylor Wimpey (L: ) and Berkeley (L: ) fell on a combination of Grafton's warning and downbeat Brexit sentiment.

""Brexit has moved to the season finale it seems,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, Asia Pacific at OANDA.

Britain and the EU seemed to be on the verge of a deal on Wednesday and European Council President Donald Tusk said that the basic foundations of the agreement were ready.

But, CMC Markets' Michael Hewson warned that progress could get ""a little tricky"", as doubts remain over whether or not British lawmakers will approve the deal at a special parliamentary session on Saturday.

""Looking at options markets, dealers started adding more premium on the short side than the long side after the DUP statement,"" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.

News-driven moves saw Moneysupermarket.com (L: ) tumble 9% to a six-month low after a trading update. Liberum analysts said its insurance and money divisions underperformed.

LONDON (Reuters) - Documents from Saudi Aramco show that the world's largest oil firm earns only a limited proportion of its profit from foreign refining ventures, an area in which the company plans huge investment.

The news comes as Aramco, according to two sources familiar with the matter, has delayed the planned launch of its initial public offering in hopes that pending third-quarter results will bolster investor confidence.

A subsidiary that holds Aramco stakes in South Korean refiner S-Oil (KS: ) and Showa Shell of Japan made a net income of $319 million (247.25 million pounds) in 2018, accounts seen by Reuters show.

Saudi Refining Inc, through which Aramco operates the largest U.S. oil refinery, made $423 million last year, separate accounts showed.

The documents, seen by Reuters, do not appear to be in the public domain.

The earnings represent a small proportion of Aramco's $111 billion in net income from 2018. They also illustrate just how profitable Aramco's core oil-producing business - which pumps about 10% of the world's oil - actually is.

Aramco is making huge investments in overseas downstream operations. With Indian companies and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, it plans to build a giant refinery and petrochemical project that sources say will cost $60 billion. Aramco declined to comment.

Selling a stake in Aramco has been a centrepiece of Vision 2030, a plan championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil.

Aramco appears to make a small proportion of its profit from refining compared with listed peers. Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), for example, earned $7.57 billion from downstream activities in 2018, almost a quarter of its $23.83 billion annual earnings.

In 2018, Aramco received revenue of $138.67 billion from its downstream operations and $216.9 billion from upstream, according to the company's published accounts.

Some analysts say Aramco's performance is better than that of its listed peers, based on metrics followed by investors in oil companies.

Jason Kenney of Santander (MC: ) said Aramco's first-half 2019 earnings showed a higher return on capital employed than listed peers and stronger performance on operational yardsticks such as refinery reliability.

This highlights ""the impressive order of magnitude at which Saudi Aramco is delivering"", he said in a report.

NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's finance ministry has completed a majority of its annual oil hedging program, working with at least four top investment banks and oil major Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), sources said, after challenges slowed the world's largest oil financial deal this year.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (N: ), Citigroup Inc (N: ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (N: ), BNP Paribas SA (PA: ) and Shell are among those the finance ministry tapped to execute the hedge, two sources familiar with the deal said this week.

Over the past two-three years, oil majors Shell and BP (L: ) began participating in the highly coveted program, challenging the traditional role of banks in the operation.

It was not immediately clear what volumes Mexico had hedged or what price protection it had secured. One Wall Street source estimated that the program was nearly complete while another put it at about 75%.

The Mexican finance ministry declined to comment because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations. Spokespersons for the banks and Shell declined to comment.

The oil hedge program runs from December to November the following year. In it, Latin America's second-largest economy buys as much as $1 billion worth of financial positions, mostly options, in a series of highly anticipated oil trades.

These options give the finance ministry the right to sell its oil for predetermined price and are designed to protect the government's revenues from oil sales for the coming year against price falls.

This year, the finance ministry faced a number of unusual challenges in kicking off the program, including price volatility and the overhaul of its formulas that underpin its export sales and the program.

Mexican Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio said on Tuesday that the government was sticking to $49 per barrel as its estimate to calculate government income in the 2020 budget, which is currently being debated and still needs to be voted on.

""This is a price at which we can control the risks of a fall in the oil price and, obviously, if the price is higher, we'll have higher income,"" he told Congress. ""So I believe we are covered against the downside risk.""

The Mexican finance ministry typically seeks to hedge its entire export volume at the price laid out in the budget. However, documents related to past deals show not all of it is always covered using options.

In some years, the finance ministry has tapped a dedicated budget revenue stabilization fund to protect a share of its export volume that is not covered through options sold by banks and oil majors.

""This year, I believe they'll do something similar to what we did back in 2017,"" said former finance ministry official Julio Ruiz, adding that probably some would be covered ""using resources from the budget stabilization fund.""

Negotiations between the Mexico and Wall Street on the hedge have long been notoriously secretive and limited to a few participants as both sides attempt to secure the best terms in a highly competitive deal for banks.

Reuters reported last month that Mexico had requested the quotes from Wall Street banks ahead of the country presenting the budget for 2020 in which it confirmed that it would seek the protection.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusive-mexico-taps-banks-oil-major-as-it-nears-end-of-2020-oil-hedge--sources-1984124,0.014,0.935,0.052,0.9582

All six killed and 25 workers who were injured were subcontractors, who receive lower pay, fewer employment protections and less training compared to full-time employees.

Samsung and other big Korean conglomerates acknowledge they rely increasingly heavily on subcontractors and temporary workers to cut costs and increase labour flexibility, but they bear little responsibility for workplace accidents, according to interviews with about two dozen workers, subcontractor executives and experts.

And according to a 2018 government-commissioned report, lenient sentences for companies and officials are hampering attempts to reduce occupational accidents in South Korea, which has the third worst industrial safety record among countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

More than two years after South Korea's worst shipyard accident in at least a decade, Park says he is suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder which worsened after a court in May ruled that no Samsung officials will serve jail time over the accident.

In an emailed response to Reuters' questions, Samsung Heavy said it regretted the casualties caused by the accident but could not elaborate further because of the appeal trial.

Samsung's email sign-offs read: ""Safety is the No.1 value in management.""

Total and Park's direct employer Haedong both declined to comment on the story. Haedong, which remains as a subcontractor for Samsung Heavy, was not prosecuted in the criminal trial, court documents showed.

MULTI-LAYERED SUBCONTRACTING

South Korean conglomerates like Samsung have been the backbone of the country's rapid economic transformation since the devastation of the Korean War into a global manufacturing and engineering powerhouse.

But as competition has increased and growth slowed, the groups known locally as chaebol have increased hiring of temporary and subcontracted workers to cut costs, boost production and make it easier to dismiss staff when demand fluctuates, experts and industry officials say.

Temporary workers accounted for 21.2% of all the workers in South Korea in 2018, nearly double the OECD average of 11.7%.

Workers at South Korea's subcontracted firms earned 3.4 million won ($334) per month, only 62% of what their peers at prime contractors made, the state-funded Korea Labor Institute said in a report last October.

""This is not just a problem of Samsung, but Korea Inc,"" said Lyou Sung-gyou, a labour attorney and a member of a presidential labour advisory body. ""Conglomerates take profits, but they escape legal responsibility by creating a multi-layered subcontractor structure.""

South Korea's Labour Ministry said it is ""essential"" to strengthen the responsibility of prime contractors for their subcontractors' safety measures.

""(Prime) contractors know the best harmful and risk factors at workplaces controlled or managed by them,"" the ministry said in a statement to Reuters.

The ministry added it had revised an occupational safety law to expand the scope of work sites where prime contractors are responsible for the safety of the workers.

Outsourcing is especially prevalent in South Korea's shipbuilding industry, the world's largest by order volumes last year.

Subcontractors at Korean shipbuilders accounted for less than half of the total workforce in 2000, but topped 70% in 2014-2015, according to a report by a government-sanctioned panel of experts who investigated the 2017 Samsung crane accident.

Subcontractors further outsourced their work to third-tier workers to cut costs more, which would ""inevitably increase the risks of industrial accidents"", the 2018 report said.

At Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), a major client for South Korean shipbuilders, Ju Young-kyu, a senior manager at its South Korean unit, told Reuters multi-tier subcontracting is a ""unique"" feature in South Korea's shipyards as opposed to Chinese peers which tend to outsource less.

Better management and assessment of unskilled workers was needed to reduce accidents, he added.

The use of subcontracted workers has also enabled businesses to reduce occupational accident insurance premiums.

Samsung Group, South Korea's biggest conglomerate, enjoyed discounts of nearly 400 billion won ($334 million) from 2016 to June 2019 for its occupational accident insurance premiums because of fewer accidents involving staff employers and because it was not liable for accidents involving subcontractors, two ruling party lawmakers said this year, citing internal government data.

Samsung Heavy, asked about insurance premiums and legal responsibilities, said prime contractors and subcontractors shoulder responsibility depending on legal liabilities of each accident.

Workers for subcontractors in other industries are also vulnerable.

For instance, a fire at a Samsung Electronics (LON: ) phone parts supplier, Seil Electronics, left nine dead and several injured last year, a court ruling showed.

Samsung Electronics did not comment on the fire incident at Seil, its second-tier phone parts supplier. Seil declined to comment.

GAGGING CLAUSES

In South Korea, private settlements between companies and individuals at criminal proceedings are a key factor in leading to lighter sentences in civil workplace accident cases, according to last year's government-commissioned report.

Over 90% of offenders received suspended sentences or minor fines - less than 10 million won ($8,500) in most cases - according to the report, which analysed 1,714 rulings on industrial accident cases between 2013 and 2017.

""Because of light punishments, employers may find it cheaper to pay fines and compensation instead of investing in safety equipment,"" said Kim Sung-ryong, the lead author of the report and a law professor at Kyungpook National University.

Out of court settlements between the families of workers who died in the 2017 crane accident and Samsung contributed to suspended jail sentences for seven Samsung employees, a ruling by the Changwon District Court in May shows.

Samsung Heavy paid compensations of hundreds of thousands of dollars each to the families of some victims on behalf of subcontractors, an executive at a supplier firm who had direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

In return, the families of the victims agreed not to sue Samsung Heavy or the subcontractors, according to the executive, who declined to be named to discuss terms of the agreement meant to be confidential.

Samsung Heavy declined to comment on settlements with victims' families, saying it could not disclose ""personal information"". A prosecution official with direct knowledge of the case said prosecutors appealed the sentences but declined further comment.

After the death of a temporary worker at a power plant prompted a public outcry last year, South Korea in January amended occupational safety laws to restrict subcontracting, but only in limited areas.

The restrictions that take effect next year will barely affect outsourcing practices of the shipbuilding industry, which reported nearly 2,000 industrial accidents, including 26 deaths last year, said lawyers and labour activists who analysed the laws.

The labour ministry declined to say if the new laws apply to the shipbuilding sector and Reuters was unable to independently confirm it.

Since the deadly 2017 crane accident, Park has been unable to take the subway or elevators for fear they might collapse.

In his first interview with international media, he recalled the mangled bodies around the shipyard after the crane collapsed, hitting workers on cigarette breaks, including his brother.

Sung-woo, whose back was hit by a swinging wire, died in the emergency room from heavy bleeding.

""In the ambulance, my brother said it hurts really bad,"" Park said, tearfully recounting the moment. ""We were there to work, not to be killed.""

NUR-SULTAN (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) has pulled out of the Khazar offshore project next to the giant Kashagan field in Kazakhstan and a multinational consortium including Shell is also dropping plans for the adjoining Kalamkas block, officials said on Monday.

""The (Khazar) project was not competitive enough versus other opportunities in Shell’s global portfolio,"" the company said.

Shell had invested about $900 million (£693 million) in Khazar, a unit of Kazakh state energy firm KazMunayGaz said in a statement.

Shell, KazMunayGaz and Oman Oil Co were partners in Khazar, part of the Pearls offshore block. It was not immediately unclear if either of its two partners planned to buy Shell's stake.

Kazakh authorities said a consortium including Shell, Eni (MI: ), ExxonMobil (N: ), CNPC, Total (PA: ), Inpex (T: ) and KazMunayGaz was also quitting Kalamkas, for which it holds the licence.

The Kalamkas-Khazar project costs were estimated at $5 billion with production starting in the late 2020s, according to Wood Mackenzie analyst Ashley Sherman.

“Whether it’s because of tough logistics or complex geology, the shallow waters of Kazakhstan’s offshore face obstacles to full competitiveness against lower-cost deepwater opportunities elsewhere in the world,” Sherman said.

Energy companies have spent more than $50 billion on developing Kashagan which has been plagued by delays and cost overruns.

Like many of the big banks, HSBC (LON: ) looks massively tempting at the moment, yet is struggling to live up to its potential.

I’d buy on today’s dip The Asia-focused banking giant trades at just 10.8 times forward earnings, while offering investors a juicy forecast yield of 6.4%, covered 1.4 times by earnings. Yet investors who thought they were buying a high-dividend bargain stock will have been disappointed by recent progress. Today delivers yet another setback.

The HSBC share price is down more than 4% after Monday’s Q3 earnings release showed a 24% drop in profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, to $3bn, blamed on that reliable scapegoat “challenging market conditions.”

Reported profit before tax was down 18% to $4.8bn, worsened by additional customer redress provisions of $606m, and severance costs of $120m. Reported revenue fell 3% to $13.4bn, due to lower client activity in Global Markets, against all comparatives in the same quarter last year.

The outlook also looks glum. The report also said the “revenue environment is more challenging than in the first half of 2019, and the outlook for revenue growth is softer than we anticipated at the half-year.”

As a result, HSBC management no longer expects to reach its return on tangible equity target of more than 11% in 2020.

On the comeback trail HSBC is responding by looking to shift capital away from its low-return businesses but, combined with falling revenues, this could result in “significant charges,” including possible impairment of goodwill and additional restructuring costs.

However, the good news for investors is that HSBC intends to sustain the dividend, while maintaining a CET1 ratio of above 14%.

But the turnaround has been postponed once again. HSBC’s stock now trades 3% lower than five years ago, underperforming the which grew around 13% over the same period. The dividends offer compensation, but it’s still disappointing.

Global challenges Many investors have favoured HSBC for its Asia exposure. But this is working against it at the moment, due to the US-China trade dispute and political unrest in Hong Kong. While global diversification is appealing, it also leaves HSBC exposed to problems around the world. For example, today it reported a $132m hit from hyperinflation in Argentina.

Another problem is that this is a massive operation. After oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), it’s the second biggest company on the FTSE 100 by market capitalsation, currently a huge £120bn. Acting CEO Nigel Quinn has a major task turning this around.

Investors must now brace themselves for further restructuring, and any simplification of its sprawling operations would be welcome, if only because bank results always make horribly complex reading. However, today’s low valuation is still tempting, and HSBC could arguably double your money from here.

The wider worry, of course, is that we may suffer a global recession some point in the next year or so, triggering a jump in debt impairments, while low interest rates are already squeezing lending margins.

So yes, HSBC continues to disappoint, but if you delay buying a stock like this until everything is rosy, you will almost certainly miss out on the crucial recovery phase.

(Bloomberg) -- When BP (LON: ) announced its historic exit from Alaska, Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley pointed to an extra perk from the $5.6 billion sale: a significantly lower carbon footprint.

Cutting emissions is important for Dudley, partly because influential shareholders are forcing BP to align its spending with climate goals. But there’s a catch.

Hilcorp Energy Co., the buyer of the Alaska assets, plans to pour more money to boost production there than BP would have, according to Dudley. That could end up making the carbon problem worse than it was.

The BP boss and his counterparts at the world’s biggest oil companies are caught in a dilemma. Investors are demanding they adhere to the goals of the Paris climate accord, while continuing to generate the mounds of cash that make them among the biggest and most consistent dividend payers.

To strike a balance, one of the strategies for the executives is to sell high-cost and high-carbon projects. But that may only offload the emissions problem on to another company.

“If one asset just passes to another and still operates at its maximum capacity, OK that may have helped the profile of that individual company, but does that actually do anything on a net effect of reduced emissions?” said Adam Matthews, the director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England Pensions Board. “That’s a legitimate question.”

Oil Sands, Coal

BP (LON: ) is not the only one passing on the responsibility. Royal Dutch Shell (AS: ) divested its carbon-intensive Canadian oil-sands business in 2017 that is now operating under a new owner. Total (PA: ) sold its interest in a similar project, which was dormant, to a buyer looking to revive it. Miner Rio Tinto (LON: ) exited coal by selling some of its assets to Glencore (LON: ), which plans to keep running them for years.

The companies’ actions will be discussed when hundreds of executives gather this week at the Oil & Money conference. The event, which saw noisy protests from pressure group Extinction Rebellion outside its London venue on Tuesday, will change its name to Energy Intelligence Forum next year in a nod to climate change and the energy transition.

While the asset sales help reduce costs, Dudley, Shell’s CEO Ben van Beurden and Total’s Patrick Pouyanne will also need to show they’re committed to the environment and not just offloading their responsibility.

Still, for some investors selling the high-carbon projects makes the companies more resilient to future climate legislation, and that’s a step in the right direction.

If companies can use the funds from the sale of carbon intensive projects to develop lower-intensity production, that’s a “decision that we are generally supportive of,” said Nick Stansbury, head of commodity research at Legal & General Investment Management, one of the largest shareholders of major oil companies.

Big Challenge

Oil executives say their big challenge is to cut emissions while continuing to supply energy to a growing global economy. Shutting down production can create shortages that could boost prices, reduce affordability and even encourage the start up of new projects.

To tackle the “radical changes” required to keep global warming at a safe level, demand for low-carbon energy would have to rise dramatically, said Tal Lomnitzer, a senior investment manager at Janus Henderson Investors. It would have to be aided by government policy changes and involve social pressure, he said.

“A much faster transition is technically possible but actors need guidance,” Lomnitzer said. “It’s likely to arrive from the populace and then be expressed via bans, taxes and incentives.”

The oil companies support a tax on carbon as a way to discourage emissions, and are promoting as a cleaner fuel. France’s Total applies a carbon price internally in its assessment of projects, a spokeswoman said, as do others like BP. Qatar, the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas exporter, started a carbon capture and storage project as part of an effort to address concerns about climate change, Energy Minister Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi said Tuesday.

Investor pressure is also forcing the oil majors to increase spending on green energy. They’re building wind and solar projects, boosting electric-vehicle infrastructure and reducing the amount of gas they release into the atmosphere. But these investments are still a fraction of overall expenditure.

“The transition from Big Oil to Big Energy will certainly take time,” said Rob Barnett, an energy policy analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “But we do see things headed in that direction.”",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/big-oil-is-selling-dirty-assets-but-they-arent-going-away-1976410,0.057,0.803,0.14,0.9969

BENGALURU (Reuters) - French energy giant Total SA (PA: ) will buy a 37.4% stake in Indian gas distribution company Adani Gas (NS: ), as it looks to capitalise on the South Asian country's push for cleaner sources of energy.

Total is the third foreign oil major to enter India's gas sector after BP Plc (L: ) and Shell (L: ), and it comes at a time when India is spending heavily to cut its carbon emissions.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to more than double the share of gas in the country's energy basket to 15% by 2030, while Total has embarked on a series of deals this year to expand its liquefied (LNG) portfolio.

Total will buy up to 25.2% in Adani Gas from public shareholders at 149.63 rupees per share, representing an 8.7% premium to the stock's last close and valuing the stake at 41.47 billion rupees ($585 million).

It will also buy another 12.2% stake from the Adani family at an undisclosed price, according to stock exchange filings.

After the deal, the Adani family and Total will each hold 37.4% stake in Adani Gas, while public shareholders will own the remaining 25.2%.

Shares of Adani Gas soared 18.4% on Monday after the deal was announced, while the broader NSE index ( ) rose 0.3% in early trade.

""The natural gas market in India will have strong growth and is an attractive outlet for the world's second-largest LNG player that Total has become,"" Total Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanné said in a statement.

""Adani will bring its knowledge of the local market and its expertise in the infrastructure and energy sectors. This partnership with Adani is cornerstone to our development strategy in this country,"" added Pouyanné.

Total and Adani plan to establish a joint venture to market LNG in India and Bangladesh.

Speaking later at a conference in New Delhi, Pouyanné said the deal will take 6 months to complete, adding that the energy major was looking to capture a substantial part of the Indian gas market with Adani.

Total was also in discussions with partners including Adani for partnership in renewable energy, he said at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek.

By Shadia Nasralla and Ron Bousso

LONDON (Reuters) - Wide variations in the way oil companies report their efforts to reduce carbon emissions make it difficult to assess the risk of holding their shares as the world shifts away from fossil fuels, senior fund managers say.

Investors have poured money into so-called sustainable funds, which take into account companies' environmental, social, legal and other standards, and funds are under pressure from their customers and authorities to make those standards robust.

Fund managers are also applying environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria more widely in traditional investments to help them judge how companies will fare over the long term.

There is a growing realisation that some companies' profits will shrink faster than others as governments prioritise low-carbon energy to meet the U.N.-backed Paris agreement's goal of cutting emissions to ""net zero"" by the end of the century.

But oil and gas companies are among the biggest dividend payers, and major funds are reluctant to divest from them, arguing that by staying in they are in a better position to pressure companies to improve.

""Do investors have the data that we need? No, I don't think we have the data that we need at all,"" said Nick Stansbury, investment strategist at British insurer Legal & General's investment management unit, Britain's biggest asset manager with around $1.3 trillion under management.

""Disclosure is not necessarily so we can seek to change the numbers, but so we can start understanding and pricing the risks,"" Stansbury said.

""A THOUSAND WAYS TO PARIS""

There are many voluntary initiatives and frameworks to unify carbon accounting and target setting; some overlap but none have been universally adopted. Further projects exist for other greenhouse gases such as methane.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol is one such set of standards, established by non-governmental organisations and industrial groups in the 1990s.

Companies can report their progress in line with these standards through non-profit CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, which then ranks them. Norway's Equinor comes first in its list of 24 oil major companies, but not all of them report in every year.

There is also the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), created by the G20's Financial Stability Board, as well as industry bodies, in-house models at oil firms and banks and third-party verifiers and consultants.

""There are a thousand ways to Paris,"" London-based BP's (L: ) Chief Executive Bob Dudley said at a Chatham House event earlier this year referring to the 2015 accord aiming to keep global warming well below 2 degrees.

BP Finance Chief Brian Gilvary told Reuters BP would welcome more consistency within the sector to show what oil companies are doing about emissions and that an industry body, the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), was discussing carbon accounting.

A plethora of third party ESG verifier companies were emerging with varying ways of measuring ESG metrics, he said, adding that some such firms would say to an oil company, ""We believe your score is this, and, by the way, if you spend $50,000 we'll show you how you can improve that score.""

UBS, with $831 billion of invested assets, has $2 billion in its Climate Aware passive equity strategy, which is in part based on a company's emissions reporting.

In that strategy ""we tilt towards companies that are better performing on a range of climate metrics and away from companies that do not perform so well in this respect,"" Francis Condon, executive director for sustainable investing, said.

""We don't want to be accused of greenwashing or falling for it,"" he said, adding that UBS regularly encouraged companies to prepare for the climate transition.

Using a broad measure, global sustainable investment reached $30.1 trillion across the world's five major markets at the end of 2018, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Review. This equates to between a quarter and half of all assets under management, due to varying estimates of that figure.

Condon said most investors were still more focussed on returns than wider sustainability criteria but were becoming concerned that companies may expose them to possible future climate-related financial losses.

""There is a very limited appetite for giving up performance for higher ESG. The question is more: is management taking on risks it can't manage?""

To try to answer that question, the world's biggest financial service providers are investing in companies which provide ESG-related data.

This year alone, Moody's bought Vigeo Eiris and Four Twenty Seven, MSCI bought Carbon Delta and the London Stock Exchange bought Beyond Ratings. S&P acquired Trucost in 2016.

Independent climate risk advisors Engaged Tracking say they attracted two-thirds of their clients in the past year. All six companies provide data, assessments and consulting on the climate exposure of companies or bonds.

HOW TO COUNT

A central issue, discussed at European oil majors' shareholder meetings this year, is how they deal with the emissions caused by the products they sell, such as gasoline or kerosene, which are known as Scope 3 emissions.

Such emissions are typically around six times larger than the combined emissions from oil companies' direct operations and power supply, also known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions, according to Reuters calculations.

Even if a company publishes Scope 3 data, there are 15 different categories based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. These include use of sold products such as fuel alongside secondary factors such as business travel or employee commuting.

Constantine Pretenteris at Engaged Tracking said some companies achieved a high score for comprehensiveness by disclosing data for most of the Scope 3 categories, but left out the key ones, such as emissions from use of their fuel.

""We would love to see a general standard which makes comparisons easy,"" Sven Reinke of Moody's said. ""It doesn't fully exist these days.""

RELATIVE OR ABSOLUTE

The majority of climate-related targets are based on intensity measures, which means absolute emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls.

Total recorded Scope 3 emissions from the world's top public oil companies are still rising, largely due to rising oil and gas output, according to Reuters calculations based on data carried on Refinitiv's Eikon platform and company websites.

They showed combined Scope 3 emissions recorded by BP, Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), Exxon Mobil (N: ), ConocoPhillips' (N: ), Chevron (N: ), Eni (MI: ), Total (PA: ), Equinor (OL: ) and Repsol (MC: ) rose around 1.6% over 2018, after a 1% similar rise the previous year.

Individual figures vary according to the metrics a company chooses to include. Conoco said its Scope 3 emissions had fallen 5%, while the other companies' individual recorded Scope 3 emissions either rose or stayed roughly the same.

Asked for comment, BP and Chevron pointed to absolute targets related to their own operations. Total pointed to progress it had made towards lowering emissions intensity per unit produced. Shell and Repsol referred to their short-term intensity-based targets and Equinor said it could not take responsibility for emissions it does not control.

U.S. firm Exxon did not reply to a request for comment. Eni had no immediate comment.

Top oil companies have boosted investment in renewable energy and low-carbon technology in recent years, particularly in Europe, but much bigger sums are still going into developing oil and gas.

""We cannot change the patterns of consumption around the world - we cannot make people fly less. We can reduce the carbon intensity of the products we sell,"" Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said in June.

Mark Lewis from BNP Paribas (PA: ) and a member of TCFD, said overall cuts were what would count in the end. Repsol is currently the only major oil company to have set absolute reduction targets for all its output.

""The Paris Agreement is all about a carbon budget and that’s an absolute number. It’s not an intensity number,"" Lewis said. ""The atmosphere works in terms of absolutes not intensity.""

In the meantime, some investors are avoiding oil companies which others say should be supported for going further than many of their peers.

London-based investment management firm Sarasin & Partners said in June it was selling down its stake in Shell because its spending plans were out of synch with international climate targets.

Asked for comment, Shell pointed to comments from representatives of the pension funds of the Church of England and Britain's government Environment agency, which praised the company's transparency and said others should follow its lead.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/investors-get-lost-in-big-oils-carbon-accounting-maze-1976722,0.036,0.889,0.075,0.9956

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union taxpayers held assets worth at least $1.6 trillion (1.28 trillion pounds) offshore in 2016, equal to nearly 10% of the bloc's output, the European Commission said on Friday, estimating tax revenue losses at around $50 billion a year.

In a report, the Commission said taxpayers in the Mediterranean islands of Cyprus and Malta, which both belong to the euro currency area, held about 50% of their wealth abroad, the highest in the bloc, against 12% in France, 10% in Germany and nearly 9% in Britain, the three largest countries of the bloc.

Offshore holdings, although in many cases completely legal, could help taxpayers hide taxable money and cut their bills if they stash their savings in low-tax jurisdictions.

Wealth held abroad by EU citizens fell during the 2007-2010 global and EU financial crises, but rose again after that, EU data show, despite the bloc's declared fight against tax avoidance and a global crackdown on international tax evasion begun in 2009.

Tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici said results from this clampdown were visible in a slight drop in the wealth held abroad between 2015 and 2016.

Among the measures adopted in recent years to tackle tax dodging is the establishment of an EU blacklist of tax havens.

However, criteria to define tax dodgers have been set in such generous terms that currently the list includes only nine small jurisdictions, mostly Pacific islands with no financial relation with the EU.

The report, produced by EU staff and experts, said EU taxpayers controlled 44% of the overall wealth held worldwide in offshore shell companies in 2006, the last year for which data are available.

Shell (LON: ) structures and other offshore arrangements caused losses in tax revenues of $50 billion dollars a year between 2001 and 2016 to the 28 EU states. At global level, the EU estimated that $7.8 trillion was held offshore in 2016.

In that year, United States' residents stashed offshore 5% of their country's output, while Chinese taxpayers channelled abroad more than 15% of Chinese gross domestic product, most likely in Hong Kong, the study said.

JOHANNESBURG/MILAN (Reuters) - A Congolese presidential advisor played a key role in awarding oil licenses now at the heart of a corruption probe by Italian authorities that has engulfed energy giant Eni SpA and the family of its chief executive.

The advisor, Denis Gokana, headed a committee that awarded licenses to Italy’s Eni and a Congolese partner company he founded, according to government records and confirmed by Gokana via email.

The Congolese president appointed Gokana in 2013 to head a committee responsible for boosting the role of the country’s private sector in the economy, a role that was disclosed at the time in the official government gazette, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.

This is the first time the role played by a key Congolese official in events at the centre of the Italian corruption probe has been publicly revealed. Gokana, who is special natural resources advisor to Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso, denied any wrongdoing.

State-controlled Eni, one of the world’s largest oil companies, disclosed last year that it was under investigation by Milan prosecutors for corruption in Congo Republic. Reuters reported on Sept. 28 that Italian prosecutors were investigating the wife of Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi as part of its corruption probe.

The inquiry revolves around agreements signed between 2013 and 2015 by Eni’s Congolese subsidiary with local partners and seeks to determine whether certain contracts hid a form of bribe.

Eni denies any wrongdoing and said it had no say in the awarding of the licenses or the government’s choice of its local partner - Africa Oil & Gas Corporation (AOGC), the company founded by Gokana. A lawyer for Descalzi’s wife, Marie Magdalena Ingoba, said his client had no comment.

The Congo investigation comes as Eni faces allegations alongside Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) that it paid more than $1 billion in bribes to gain control over a Nigerian oil field. Italian authorities have charged Eni, Shell and 13 individuals, including Descalzi, with violating Italy’s international corruption law in an ongoing case in Milan.

Shell, Eni, Descalzi and the other individuals have denied any wrongdoing in the Nigeria case. The company has said it is confident the allegations levelled at it by prosecutors would be found groundless.

In the Congo matter, the fresh detail about the role of the president’s advisor raises questions about Eni’s due diligence into its local partner, said Natasha White, a London-based researcher at anti-corruption campaign group Global Witness. The non-governmental organization identified the ties between Eni and Gokana and shared the findings with Reuters.

A former Eni director told prosecutors that while at the company, he raised concerns to CEO Descalzi about ties between Eni’s Congolese partner company and the president’s advisor, and that the CEO dismissed them, according to a 2015 deposition reviewed by Reuters.

Descalzi “disputed the basis of my remarks and told me my behaviour was paralysing Eni's commercial activities in the petroleum sector,"" former board member Luigi Zingales, a finance professor, told prosecutors.

Descalzi, who has led Eni since 2014, is not a target of the corruption probe related to the company’s Congolese operations, according to Eni and a person familiar with the investigation.

Eni, Africa's biggest foreign oil and gas producer, declined to comment on Zingales’ statements to prosecutors but said it didn’t believe he was in a position to properly assess its governance.

The company said an audit conducted with the help of external lawyers and consultants found no evidence of corruption in relation to operations in Congo. Eni said its due diligence did identify that its local partner company had been founded by presidential advisor Gokana but concluded that he no longer held an ownership stake or served as a manager.

Asked whether the company was aware that Gokana headed the committee that awarded the licenses, Eni said: “Eni has no evidence of knowledge of any specific of alleged activity rendered by Mr. Gokana for the benefit of Eni in the award processes.”

A Congolese government spokesman did not respond to requests for comment addressed to the president and the government.

FAMILY TIES

Congo Republic, sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest oil producer by volume, is one of Eni’s key African operations. One area of focus for Italian prosecutors is whether Eni gave away a portion of its rights to extract oil in Congo Republic to companies linked to public officials in order to secure the reissue of oil exploration licences in violation of Italy’s international corruption laws, according to search warrants reviewed by Reuters.

""Eni SpA has 'gifted' to companies reporting to Congolese politicians participation shares in oil exploitation licenses,"" prosecutors asserted in a search warrant issued last year. The warrant identified Gokana as among several public officials with links to AOGC.

When the government in 2013 reallocated four oil extraction licenses, which Eni had previously held, the committee chose AOGC to partner with Eni, according to Gokana and Eni. Those four licenses produced oil worth about $400 million in 2014, according to a Reuters calculation based on pricing data from UK energy analysts S&P Global Platts.

Eni told Reuters that its share of the four licenses generated $127 million of gross revenues in 2014, which amounted to $72 million of free cash flow, or less than 1% of Eni’s overall free cash flow.

Gokana, in written responses to Reuters, said that the company he founded was the only local entity with the necessary technical and financial capacity to partner with Eni. He said he had been sole shareholder of AOGC but had divested his entire stake after he was appointed head of Congo’s state oil company in January 2005.

Italian prosecutors allege he has retained “very strong links” to AOGC, according to a March 2018 search warrant. The four licenses are among a number of permit allocations involving Eni that Italian authorities are investigating, according to the warrant.

Gokana confirmed to Reuters that his cousin had been chairman of the local partner. The cousin, Dieudonne Bantsimba, was listed as AOGC’s chairman on the company’s website as recently as January of this year.

Reached by telephone, Bantsimba said he no longer held the role. He declined to say when he stepped down or answer further questions.

Eni said that its investigations in Congo ""could not (and did not) identify the alleged presence of family ties between Gokana and Bantsimba."" It added “that AOGC had certified to Eni the absence of family ties between any company beneficiaries and public officials.”

AOGC didn’t respond to a request for comment.

“A SORT OF ‘RETROCESSION’”

Another part of the Italian prosecutors’ corruption probe focuses on what they describe in search warrants as “a sort of ‘retrocession,’” or a form of kickback, involving six individuals, including the wife of Eni CEO Descalzi.

Specifically, prosecutors are investigating whether the individuals benefited from a deal in which AOGC obtained a stake in a potentially promising offshore oil exploration zone and then transferred it to a British-registered oil exploration company named World Natural Resources Ltd.

In a Sept. 26 prosecution document related to Ingoba, prosecutors allege WNR’s then-director Alexander Haly was a business partner of Descalzi's wife.

Haly is chief executive of Monaco-based supply-ship operator Petro Services, part of Amsterdam-based Petroserve Holding BV, according to the company’s web site. Petro Services’ Congo subsidiary won more than $100 million worth of contracts with Eni from 2012 to 2017, according to a 2018 search warrant.

Prosecutors, in the September document, allege Petro Services was controlled by Descalzi’s wife via a series of shell companies located in Holland, Luxembourg and Cyprus.

In its response to Reuters, Eni said contracts won by Petro Services “took place within a competitive framework” and ""no Eni director or employee has ever told the company about having an interest in World Natural Resources.""

A spokeswoman for Haly and Petro Services declined to comment. According to British company registration filings, Haly resigned as a WNR director in 2014.

WNR didn’t respond to a request for comment.

'SIMPLY DISCLOSED’

Italian authorities are also investigating the CEO and his wife in relation to a separate probe into alleged failure to disclose a conflict of interest connected to Eni’s dealings in Congo.

No charges have been made in either the corruption or the disclosure probe related to Eni’s Congolese operations.

Descalzi, whose term as CEO is up for renewal by shareholders next spring, denied wrongdoing in a written response to Reuters. “Had I known about any such potential situation, I would have simply disclosed,” he said.

Descalzi also referred Reuters to a statement issued by Eni last month in which he said in part: “I am totally certain that I have always behaved lawfully.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), Japan's Mitsubishi Corp (T: ) and private equity firm KKR (N: ) have made the final round in an auction for Dutch utility Eneco, three sources close to the matter said.

The deadline for final bids is November 4, one source said.

Eneco, estimated by analysts to be worth about 3 billion euros, aims to wrap up the process by Christmas.

Royal Dutch Shell has teamed with Dutch pension fund manager PGGM while KKR has teamed with Dutch lender Rabobank, the sources said.

Eneco generates about half its electricity from renewable energy.

The 53 Dutch local authorities that own the company launched the sale in May, initially attracting European utilities, oil and gas companies and infrastructure funds.

The field of prospective buyers has narrowed, partly due to a long delay in the process stemming from differences between management and shareholders about the future of the company.

Some private equity investors also refrained from bidding as there was a indication from the company that a strategic buyer was preferred, sources said.

A spokeswoman for Rabobank confirmed its consortium is still in the running.

SHEL +0.53% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) said on Thursday it would offset the carbon dioxide emissions of around 1.5 million road users in Britain starting later this month under a loyalty scheme.

Shell, like other oil companies, has come under pressure from shareholders to show how it plans to reduce its carbon footprint and help cut greenhouse gas emissions, a major cause of global warming.

Britons are increasingly concerned about their environmental impact, with thousands of students striking earlier this year and green group Extinction Rebellion carrying out civil disobedience to push for more ambition on climate change.

Sinead Lynch, Shell UK country chair, said the best way for people to cut their road emissions was to use electric vehicles, supplied with renewable power.

""But today the majority of people still use petrol and diesel. We can help them address the impact of their emissions by offsetting their fuel purchases,"" she said in a statement.

From Oct. 17, emissions relating to fuel purchased by customers with the Shell Go+ app or card will be offset for free until September 2020.

Shell said about 20% of its customers were registered with the loyalty scheme. It expects the programme to cost roughly 10 million pounds and offset emissions from around 1.5 million cars.

Carbon offsetting involves helping to fund a cut in emissions elsewhere, such as through preventing deforestation.

Some climate groups say offsetting should be used as a last resort and that absolute emission cuts should be the priority.

Shell said it would use carbon credits from conservation projects in Peru, Indonesia, the United States and Britain.

Most of the credits that will be used for the scheme have already been bought, Shell said, but it did not disclose the purchase price.

The cost of carbon offsets varies widely depending on the type of project and the social and environmental benefits it brings.

Credits traded under a U.N.-backed scheme are trading at around 0.22 euro per tonne of carbon dioxide, while carbon-offsetting firms can charge around 8 euros a tonne.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-to-offset-carbon-emissions-for-british-fuel-buyers-1977143,0.033,0.854,0.112,0.9856

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell's (L: ) chief executive took aim beyond the energy sector to call on leaders of other industries including aviation, shipping and steel to jointly draw up plans to tackle greenhouse gas emissions.

Ben van Beurden also warned on Wednesday that energy companies that do not collaborate in the fight against climate change under the 2015 Paris agreement risk going out of business.

""Climate change is the biggest challenge facing the energy industry, but the energy industry isn't the biggest challenge for the world trying to tackle climate change,"" van Beurden told the Oil & Money conference.

""All sectors need to figure out pathways to net zero emissions.""

Oil and gas companies have come under huge public and investor pressure in recent years to reduce carbon emissions from their operations and the products they sell.

For a graphic on Oil Majors' Carbon emissions, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/OIL-CARBON/0H001QX928M7/eikon.png

But van Beurden said that to reach the Paris climate goals for ""net zero"" emissions by the end of the century, governments and industries need to transform demand.

Government-set taxes on carbon emissions will not be enough to turn the tide and coordinated action from industries to improve efficiency and reduce emissions is essential, he said.

""If this type of sector-by-sector action does not happen, the world will fail to meet the goals of the Paris agreement.""

Shell, the world's second-largest listed energy company, has recently taken part in a joint effort with the Danish government, AP Moeller Maersk (CO: ), the world's largest shipper, and Citigroup (N: ) bank, to come up with ways to develop a system to offset emissions from commercial ships, van Beurden said.

You don’t have to look far to find someone predicting a stock market crash is just around the corner. Many commentators are suggesting we’re due another crash because it’s been 10 years since the last one, in 2009.

There’s some truth in this. For example, the market crashed in 1987, 2000 and 2008. However, we also saw falls of between 10% and 20% in 2011, 2016 and 2018, for example. Are we really due for a crash? I’m not so sure. In order to understand the state of the market, I think we need to take a broader view of companies’ valuation and their financial health.

Does the look expensive? If the index looked very expensive, that might discourage me from buying. Overpaying for investments is one of the easiest ways to lose money.

Is the expensive today?

At the time of writing, the big-cap index was trading on 14.6 times earnings, with a dividend yield of 4.6%. Dividend cover looks okay to me, at 1.5 times earnings. Based in these numbers, I’d say the index looks decent value.

What if earnings crash?

The FTSE’s valuation looks reasonable, but are these profits sustainable? Are we heading for an earnings crash which would make the index look much more expensive? This is a more difficult question. It’s probably fair to say some of the larger companies in the index face a challenging outlook.

For example, tobacco stocks are under pressure as investors are concerned about falling smoking rates and heavy debt loads. Big oil and gas stocks such as Shell (LON: ) and BP (LON: ) are facing pressure to explain how they’ll adapt to a lower carbon future.

In a world of ultra-low interest rates, banks are finding it hard to maintain attractive profit margins. Although defensive consumer stocks such as Unilever (LON: ) and Diageo (LON: ) are generating record profits, such firms already trade at quite steep valuations. Any failure to deliver could see ratings fall.

As you can see, there are reasons to be cautious. But that’s very often the case. Investing always carries risk and uncertainty. Although there are some individual stocks I would avoid, I still think the FTSE 100 index looks an attractive investment overall.

What about the economy?

More than half of all revenue reported by firms comes from outside the UK. So risks, such as the US-China trade war, are relevant to FTSE investors. Similarly, the health of major EU economies is worth considering, not just that of the UK.

The economic news seems to be mixed at the moment. Today, I see reports US and German manufacturing slowed in September. At home, UK retailers have reported the worst September since the mid-1990s. Are we headed for a recession? Perhaps.

My plan

Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio once said: “He who lives by the crystal ball will eat shattered glass.” I see this as a suggestion that predicting the future is dangerous and unwise.

My plan is simply to invest in companies with strong finances and attractive valuations. As a long-term investor, I’m confident good companies will survive and prosper. By drip-feeding money into the market each month, I hope to pick up some cheap stocks next time the market crashes.

In the meantime, I collect my dividends and profit from any market gains.

LONDON (Reuters) - Climate change activists used a fire engine to hose a red liquid at the facade of the British finance ministry on Thursday in an attempt to draw attention to what they said was the government's failure to avert a looming climate cataclysm.

The activists from the group Extinction Rebellion drove up to the Treasury in a fire engine they had purchased on eBay (NASDAQ: ), and sprayed what they described as fake blood high onto the building.

After the stunt, four activists including an 83-year-old man stood on the roof of the fire engine, from which they hung a banner saying ""Stop funding climate death"", a slogan that was also daubed onto the wall of the imposing central London building.

Fellow protesters stood on the street displaying other banners with slogans such as ""This is an emergency"". The steps of the Treasury and the street in front were soaked in the red liquid, which was water coloured with food dye.

""The Treasury has been frustrating efforts by other government departments to take action against climate change because it cares only about economic growth,"" one of the activists, named Ben, told Reuters at the scene.

""It doesn’t see that eternal economic growth leads to climate death,"" he said. ""The red symbolises the people dying now in the global south and also the people who are going to start dying from climate change all around the world if we do nothing.""

The Treasury said in response that the United Kingdom was a world leader on climate change, having reduced its carbon emissions by 42 percent between 1990 and 2017, while growing the economy by more than two-thirds.

""In June, we became the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming by 2050. We will continue to build on this proud record,"" a Treasury spokeswoman said.

Police cordoned off the area and arrested at least six people on suspicion of criminal damage, according to Reuters reporters at the scene. A police spokeswoman said final arrest figures were not yet available.

Extinction Rebellion is calling for the UK to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2025. It accuses the British government of investing vast sums in carbon-intensive projects that are inconsistent with its stated environmental aims.

The group says it wants non-violent civil disobedience to force governments to cut carbon emissions and avert a climate crisis it says will bring starvation and social collapse.

The group disrupted London with 11 days of protests in April that it cast as the biggest act of civil disobedience in recent British history.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/climate-change-activists-spray-red-paint-at-uk-treasury-from-fire-engine-1974712,0.122,0.824,0.054,-0.9843

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1.1 trillion (894.7 billion pounds) sovereign fund will divest from companies that are solely dedicated to oil and gas exploration and production, while maintaining stakes in refiners and other downstream firms, the country's Finance Ministry said on Tuesday.

Norway's Parliament earlier this year endorsed a plan to cut some oil firms from the fund's portfolio, but it was left to the government to define the scope of the exclusion.

The move will partly shift the rainy day fund away from oil and gas, as called for by the central bank, which had originally sought to cut all petroleum producers in order to better protect the country from a potential future fall in prices.

The decision to divest affects the fund's holdings in some 95 companies, with the value of its stakes amounting to around 54 billion Norwegian crowns (4.8 billion pounds) as of mid-September of this year, the ministry said in a statement.

An earlier decision to maintain investments in so-called integrated oil majors, including Shell (L: ) and ExxonMobil Corp (N: ), remains in force and was not part of the latest review.

Norway, Europe's second-largest producer of oil and gas after Russia, saves proceeds from its petroleum industry in foreign stocks, bonds and real estate in what has become the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.

The government opposed a full ban, arguing that major oil firms have the scale and technological ability to shift towards renewable energy.

The divestments would take place gradually and over time, the ministry said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/norway-sovereign-wealth-fund-to-divest-oil-explorers-keep-refiners-1973979,0.055,0.857,0.088,0.8536

LONDON (Reuters) - North Sea oil producer Chrysaor completed on Monday a $2.675 billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips' (N: ) British North Sea oil and gas business, cementing the private equity-backed firm's position as one the basin's top producers.

The Conoco assets will add around 72,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to Chrysaor's production, bringing their total output in the first half of 2019 to 195,000 boed, Chrysaor said in a statement. The deal has an effective date of Jan. 1, 2018.

Chrysaor Chief Executive Officer Phil Kirk said production is expected to average below 195,000 boed in 2019 and between 180,000 to 190,000 boed next year.

Backed by private equity firms EIG Global Partners and Harbour Energy, Chrysaor was already one of the biggest North Sea players after acquiring assets from Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) for $3.8 billion in 2017.

The company remains acquisitive and does not foresee any asset disposals at the moment, Kirk told Reuters in an interview.

Although Chrysaor and other private equity-backed North Sea firms have in the past flagged an intention to list on public stock exchanges, Kirk said the company and its owners have no timeline for an initial public offering.

""There is no rush for an IPO at all if that is the right thing to do,"" Kirk said.

Following the Conoco acquisition, Chrysaor became operator of the Britannia and J-Block fields and also holds a 7.5 stake in the giant BP-operated Clair field (L: ).

Kirk said Chrysaor plans to work with its new partners, particularly in Britannia block and J-Block to develop the sub-surface, bring seismic data up to date and boost output.

Chrysaor plans to spend $800 million to $1 billion per year on its portfolio in the coming years.

Under the deal, Chrysaor will also assume around $1.8 billion in fields abandonment and dismantling costs, known as decommissioning, Conoco said in a separate statement.

(Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index touched an eight month low on Thursday after sluggish U.S. services data cemented fears of a global slowdown triggered by a string of weak manufacturing data, while the UK appeared to have tipped into a recession.

UK stocks lagged their European peers and Wall Street, with the main index ( ), which suffered its worst one-day drop since before the 2016 Brexit referendum on Wednesday, ending 0.6% lower. Energy stocks Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) were the biggest drag as oil prices fell on the same worries about the global economy. [O/R]

The mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) slipped 0.7% to its lowest in more than a month after data showed the UK services sector unexpectedly shrank last month as the country's exit from the European Union dragged on.

On the blue-chip index, stocks trading ex-dividend added downward pressure, with packaging firm DS Smith (L: ), tobacco firm BAT (L: ), ad firm WPP (L: ), housebuilder Taylor Wimpey (L: ) and retailer Kingfisher (L: ) dropping between 2.4% and 5.7%.

A slew of shockingly weak U.S. economic data, lingering fears over the Sino-U.S. trade dispute and heightened no-deal Brexit jitters have spooked traders this week, and the World Trade Organization's approval of U.S. tariffs on European goods has further fanned fears.

""With markets already looking vulnerable over concerns about a manufacturing recession starting to bleed into a slowdown in the services sector, the WTO ruling could not have come at a worse time,"" CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said.

Those fears were exacerbated after data showed growth in the world's largest economy's services sector slowed to its most anaemic pace in three years last month.

However, increasing bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve would cut interest rates for the third time this year later this month helped the FTSE 100 recoup some losses later in the session.

""We do not see this early fourth quarter weakness as heralding the end of the equity bull market, however the central bank reaction to declining U.S. data will be key for equities going forward,"" said Edward Park, Deputy Chief Investment Officer at investment manager Brooks Macdonald.

The globally-exposed FTSE 100 is headed for its steepest weekly fall in more than one-and-a-half years.

Notable movers included Ted Baker (LON: ), which posted its biggest ever one-day decline, slumping 40% to a nine-year low after reporting a first-half pre-tax loss and warning that unseasonably warm weather, heavy discounting by rivals and weak consumer demand would hit full-year profit.

Online trading platform CMC Markets (L: ) climbed 7.7% after it forecast a jump in annual earnings.

(Reuters) - A sharp recovery in London's FTSE 100 led by oil majors BP and Shell (LON: ) on Friday was not enough to stop the index from recording its worst weekly performance in nearly a year amid fears of an economic slowdown and risk of recession.

The index ( ) rose 1.1% after encouraging U.S. job data calmed investors' nerves but the bourse still posted its worst week since that of Oct. 12 last year.

The UK-oriented FTSE 250 ( ) climbed 0.7%, led by gains in power generator Drax (L: ) after sources told Reuters the European Commission was set to approve Britain's roughly one billion pound power backup plan.

Blue-chip peers SSE (L: ) and Centrica (L: ) also gained.

A parade of weak readings on services and manufacturing sectors from multiple major economies has left little doubt that the U.S.-China trade war has constricted global growth.

However, a report that showed moderate U.S. job growth in September and unemployment rate that dropped to a 50-year low, helped soothe fears and spurred buying in stocks.

Investors also grew hopeful that central banks will step in with further stimulus. The Federal Reserve - the world's biggest central bank - has already cut interest rates twice this year.

""As for the Fed, this (U.S. job) report doesn't really shift the needle too much – not so hot to force a rethink on cuts, but not a disaster that could ramp expectations for more aggressive easing,"" said Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com.

At home, investors remained worried about London's ability to secure a Brexit deal with Brussels at a summit later this month, with the state of the UK economy appearing to have slipped into recession also adding to anxiety.

The FTSE index of 100 most valued UK companies had fallen as much as 160 points below its 200-day moving average on Friday despite gains and has lagged other major markets this year, underlining the additional turmoil Brexit has brought on.

""There's precious little positivity around UK stocks - Brexit uncertainty, profit warnings aplenty, CEO purges, weak UK data and a slowing macro picture for the heavy weights exposed to global growth adds up to a pretty disappointing near term outlook for the FTSE,"" Wilson said.

In corporate news, BP (L: ) became the latest blue-chip company to name a new top boss as it said upstream business head Bernard Looney would succeed CEO Bob Dudley, sending its shares up more than 2%.

Tobacco giant Imperial Brands (L: ) and retailer Tesco (L: ) also announced CEO departures this week.

LSE (L: ) advanced nearly 3% after a Reuters report that some of its investors had asked Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to sweeten the takeover bid.

Insurers ( ) ended on a positive note after Britain's markets watchdog threw down the gauntlet, saying they could avoid mandatory pricing restrictions if they voluntarily stop penalising loyal customers.

The sub-index earlier touched its lowest level since February on fears of such restrictions.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - An alternative route bypassing Danish waters for the construction of the undersea Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline would cost ""hundreds of millions of dollars"", the chairman of Russian gas company Gazprom (MM: ) told Reuters.

The comments by Viktor Zubkov mark the first time Gazprom has conceded that the project would run up significant costs by making a detour around Denmark.

In a letter obtained by Reuters in August, the pipeline operator said the project could be delayed by up to eight months and incur further costs of 560 million euros due to hurdles in securing permits from Denmark.

The initial budget was 9.5 billion euros.

Zubkov, speaking on the sidelines of an energy conference in Moscow this week, also said Gazprom was hopeful that Denmark would still allow it to run the pipeline through its waters.

Of all the countries through which Gazprom is building the pipeline to Germany under the Baltic Sea, Denmark is the only one yet to approve the project.

Nord Stream 2 faces resistance from some European countries and the United States, which say it would enhance Europe's dependence on Russian energy supplies.

The project would double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream pipeline from Russia to Germany to 110 billion cubic metres a year and allow Russia to bypass Ukraine, currently its main transit route for European sales.

""The increase (in costs) would be in hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Zubkov said in reference to circumnavigating Denmark.

Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Denmark on Wednesday to ignore U.S. pressure and ""show it has sovereignty"" by allowing Nord Stream 2 to go through its territory.

Aside from Gazprom, half of the funding for Nord Stream 2 is being provided by Germany's Uniper (DE: ) and BASF's (DE: ) Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch company Shell (L: ), Austria's OMV (VI: ) and France's Engie (PA: ).",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/gazprom-nord-stream-2-cost-would-rise-by-hundreds-of-millions-to-bypass-denmark-1975223,0.018,0.925,0.057,0.8979

(Bloomberg) -- Norway’s massive wealth fund got the go-ahead to sell oil and gas stocks worth $5.9 billion, ending a two-year process that has reduced an initial proposal to dump all its petroleum investments to a more moderate divestment.

The $1 trillion fund shocked markets in 2017 when it asked the government for permission to sell about $40 billion in such stocks, arguing a cut in exposure would reduce the overall risk for Norway, western Europe’s biggest petroleum producer. That plan was then heavily diluted in a political compromise that shielded the world’s biggest oil companies.

The final plan from the Finance Ministry released late Tuesday evening in Oslo outlines a divestment that will be even smaller than the government had foreseen in March, when it estimated disposals would total about 70 billion kroner ($7.6 billion).

As expected, the divestment will now include companies classified as “Oil: Crude Producers” by index provider Russell. The number of companies held by the fund in that category was 95 in mid-September, making up 0.8% of the fund’s benchmark for equities. The divestment will “be made gradually over time,” the government said.

According to a list provided by FTSE Russell in July, the fund’s biggest holdings in that category at the end of 2018 were ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ), EOG Resources Inc (NYSE: )., Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE: ). and CNOOC Ltd. The Finance Ministry didn’t provide an updated list of companies in Tuesday’s statement.

By using the index classification, the fund’s investments will continuously be blocked from “upstream oil and gas companies, including corporate events, new listings and new information on or changes in companies’ activities over time,” the government said.

The plan marks a compromise for the Conservative-led government, which is heavily dependent on oil income and faces an increasingly powerful environmental movement. The government decided to shield the biggest oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, arguing they will likely be big investors in renewable energy in the years ahead.

Regardless of its scope, the divestment has been widely debated in Norway and left a mark globally. While the fund and the government have insisted the move has nothing to do with the climate crisis and is purely about an oil-producing nation’s risk exposure, it has been widely celebrated by activists and politicians as a powerful signal that fossil fuels are losing favor among investors.

In a show of how divided even Norway’s government is on how to interpret the divestment, Environment Minister Ola Elvestuen called it “the most important climate decision” the coalition has agreed on, in direct contradiction of the official line.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/norway-wealth-fund-gets-nod-to-sell-6-billion-in-oil-stocks-1974011,0.064,0.887,0.05,-0.791

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Ithaca Energy have given the go-ahead for upgrading the Pierce oilfield in the British North Sea so that it can produce , Shell said on Thursday.

The project involves modifying the existing floating production, support and offloading (FPSO) vessel and installing a sub-sea gas export line from the FPSO to the SEGAL pipeline.

It also involves drilling new wells in the field, which now produces oil and reinjects gas into the reservoir.

""This important development of the Pierce field will allow us to unlock additional gas reserves for the UK,"" said Steve Phimister, head of Shell's North Sea.

Pierce is Shell's eighth final investment decision in Britain's Continental Shelf since the start of 2018, Phimister added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's National Theatre has decided to end its partnership with energy group Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) as part of a broader ""climate emergency"" initiative to reduce its carbon impact.

The move came in the week that the Royal Shakespeare Company said it would drop BP (LON: ) Plc as its sponsor after young people told the theatre group its association with the energy company turned them off going to its plays.

""The National Theatre has declared a climate emergency today ... Shell have been valued and longstanding supporters of the National Theatre ... This membership will come to an end in June 2020,"" a National Theatre spokeswoman said.

Shell, which had been giving the theatre around 15,000 pounds a year as a corporate member, said ""heightened awareness of climate change... is a good thing"".

(Bloomberg) -- One of the opening events of Climate Week in New York offered a rare sight -- nine bosses of some of the world’s largest oil and gas companies in one room.

The occasion was the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, an industry-supported organization whose members set targets to reduce methane emissions and gas flaring. Present Monday were the chief executive officers of companies including BP (LON: ) Plc, Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: )., Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and Total SA (PA: ). They took questions from reporters and activists.

Here are some highlights:

Ben van Beurden, CEO, Royal Dutch Shell:

“Ultimately, (the) Paris (agreement on climate) is going to be met..In the end it is the responsibility of industry, companies like us, to make sure that the transition is going to be as orderly as possible and not going to be disruptive.”

“Natural gas could be a part of the solution.”

Darren Woods, CEO, Exxon Mobil:

The energy industry has gone through transitions for decades. “I don’t see this a threat, it’s an evolution of the industry” and from past experiences evolution is driven by technology. “We look at that challenge as a natural evolution.”

Patrick Pouyanne, CEO, Total:

“The only question is the pace at which society -- not only us -- society will accept to make this transformation.”

Christiana Figueres, former Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change:

The energy industry could “either put the nail in the coffin of all the global efforts (on climate change) or be the industry that develops and delivers the solution.”

“Let it not be questioned that we have to be net zero (carbon emissions) by 2050. That is ’50 at the latest.”

Mark Brownstein, Senior Vice President, Environmental Defense Fund:

The energy industry gets an “A” for effort but not for following through with actions. While the OGCI represents about 30% of global oil and gas production, that could be more than 50% if it brings on board the national oil companies and other partners. “Some may need to be brought along kicking and screaming.”

Ahmad Al Khowaiter, CTO, Saudi Aramco:

The dual issue of rising energy needs and climate concerns is “something that we struggle with as an industry. It’s something we also see as critical.”

First low-hanging fruit is transportation. “The need is so great and the time is so short.”

Vicki Hollub, CEO, Occidental (NYSE: ) Petroleum:

Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology is there but has to be exploited on a broad scale. Occidental wants to build the world’s largest atmospheric carbon capture plant in the Permian Basin. When it comes to acting on climate change, “failure is not an option.”

Eldar Saetre, CEO, Equinor:

“Flaring is one of the biggest issues as it’s a waste and bad for the industry’s reputation...we can do something about it.”

Mike Wirth, CEO, Chevron:

LONDON (Reuters) - Environment activists glued themselves to a British government building on Wednesday, warning that public health was being endangered by climate and ecological breakdown.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has launched its first major auction of offshore wind farm leases in a decade, offering sites with the combined potential to power more than six million homes.

Britain is already the world's largest offshore wind market, and plans to generate a third of its electricity from the technology by 2030 as a part of efforts to reach its 2050 net zero carbon emissions target.

The Crown Estate’s so-called fourth leasing round is expected to attract bids from established offshore wind developers as well as European oil majors, under pressure from shareholders to show how they plan to align their businesses with global efforts to cut emissions.

Shell (L: ) said earlier this year in an interview with Reuters it would take an ""active role"" in the tender.

The Crown Estate, which acts as manager of the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland said in a statement on Thursday that four broad areas of seabed would be made available to the market.

Combined, the sites have the potential to host a total of 7 gigawatts (GW) of electricity generation.

Companies will assess the areas available and then make their own proposals for project sites.

The Crown Estate will then asses the viability of the proposals, with the tender process beginning in October and expected to take around 12 months.

First seabed rights could be awarded in early 2021, The Crown Estate said.

Its last major licensing round for offshore wind took place a decade ago, with winners including Britain's SSE (L: ) and Norway’s Statkraft announced in early 2010.

Britain currently has around 9.3 GW of operational offshore wind capacity, with around 8% of the country’s electricity coming from offshore wind in 2018.

It is also host to the world's largest fully operation offshore wind farm: Orsted’s (CO: ) 659 megawatt Walney Extension project.

Crown Estate Scotland is also set to launch an offshore wind seabed licensing round for sites off the Scottish coast in October.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/britain-launches-first-major-auction-for-offshore-wind-leases-in-a-decade-1965525,0.012,0.946,0.042,0.8555

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 dropped on Wednesday, with investors fearing that a call by U.S. lawmakers for an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump would pile on more political uncertainty to an already fragile global economy.

Trump unleashed a fresh barrage of harsh comments on Beijing's trade practices on Tuesday, denting optimism around Sino-U.S. proposed talks and hurting internationally-focussed financials, oil majors (L: ) (L: ) and miners, pushing the main index ( ) down 0.8%.

If losses hold, the index is headed for its biggest one-day drop since late August.

The FTSE 250 ( ) also shed 0.8% by 0803 GMT as more investors focused on the future course of Brexit, with the House of Commons set to reconvene after the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday Prime Minister Boris Johnson had suspended parliament unlawfully.

""Calls for resignation grow. But nothing has really changed. The only narrative that counts is that there’s elite out there frustrating Brexit at every turn,"" Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson wrote about the U.S. and UK political turmoil.

Worries over how, when or even if the UK will leave the European Union have dragged down sterling for most of the year and partly aided consecutive gains in the exporter-laden FTSE 100 in June and July.

Frustration over few signs of tangible progress in the U.S.-China trade talks and a modest recovery in sterling amid lawmakers' legally-binding moves to prevent a no-deal Brexit have left the main index with meagre gains so far this month.

While the pound was on the back foot after Tuesday's gains that were triggered by the Supreme Court ruling, the FTSE 100 still could not catch a break, indicating that problems ranged far beyond Brexit.

Meanwhile, a mixed bag of company news provided little impetus to indexes.

Sainsbury's (L: ) added 2.41% after the supermarket chain laid out a new plan to cut costs, speed up debt reduction and overhaul its store estate and financial services division as it reported better trading in the recent quarter.

Internet-based fashion retailer Boohoo (L: ), however, slipped 3.3% as strong results triggered profit-taking in early trading.

United Utilities (L: ) and its primary rival Severn Trent (L: ) managed gains of 1% each after United forecast a strong first-half as it benefited from regulatory incentives.

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 index hit a near-two-month high on Friday, outperforming European peers, as exporters were bolstered by an ailing pound after a Bank of England policymaker hinted at an interest rate cut, while hopes of a U.S-China trade deal also lifted the mood.

The globally-exposed FTSE 100 ( ) jumped more than 1%, surprisingly ending the week in the black thanks to substantial gains in the last two sessions.

A lack of any major chipmaker presence shielded the index from a profit warning from Nasdaq-listed Micron Technology (O: ), helping it outperform European's main index.

The domestically-focused FTSE 250 ( ), which had broken ranks with sterling, rose 0.8%.

In a first clear sign that the BoE is considering a cut, policymaker Michael Saunders said it may need to cut interest rates in the likely scenario that high levels of uncertainty over Brexit persist.

""This is significant as Saunders has traditionally been a hawkish voice on the Monetary Policy Committee,"" CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said.

Even as the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline approaches, very little is clear about how or even whether the UK will leave the European Union. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in a standoff with parliament after vowing to Britain out of the bloc on Oct. 31, with or without a deal.

As a weaker pound boosts the value of exporters' revenue from overseas, international companies such as oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) and Asia-facing lender HSBC (L: ) were the biggest boost on the main index.

Hopes that a drawn-out China-U.S. trade dispute might be nearing a solution also helped sentiment after China said on Thursday it was in close communication with the United States over trade talks next month.

Gains of roughly 1% in the last two sessions helped the FTSE 100 recoup some of the losses seen in August, when it suffered its worst monthly fall since October last year due to heightened concerns over global trade and recession.

Friday's surge has put the index course for its biggest monthly gain since April, albeit a flat quarter.

Leading gains on the main index, Britain's second-largest homebuilder, Persimmon (L: ), jumped 5.2% after the brokerage Jefferies said Brexit risks had been overplayed in the sector, and upgraded the stock.

A sub-index of housebuilders ( ) touched its highest level in almost a year.

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 index hit a near-two-month high on Friday, outperforming European peers, as exporters were bolstered by an ailing pound after a Bank of England policymaker hinted at an interest rate cut, while hopes of a U.S-China trade deal also lifted the mood.

The globally-exposed FTSE 100 ( ) jumped more than 1%, surprisingly ending the week in the black thanks to substantial gains in the last two sessions.

A lack of any major chipmaker presence shielded the index from a profit warning from Nasdaq-listed Micron Technology (O: ), helping it outperform European's main index.

The domestically-focused FTSE 250 ( ), which had broken ranks with sterling, rose 0.8%.

In a first clear sign that the BoE is considering a cut, policymaker Michael Saunders said it may need to cut interest rates in the likely scenario that high levels of uncertainty over Brexit persist.

""This is significant as Saunders has traditionally been a hawkish voice on the Monetary Policy Committee,"" CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said.

Even as the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline approaches, very little is clear about how or even whether the UK will leave the European Union. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in a standoff with parliament after vowing to Britain out of the bloc on Oct. 31, with or without a deal.

As a weaker pound boosts the value of exporters' revenue from overseas, international companies such as oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) and Asia-facing lender HSBC (L: ) were the biggest boost on the main index.

Hopes that a drawn-out China-U.S. trade dispute might be nearing a solution also helped sentiment after China said on Thursday it was in close communication with the United States over trade talks next month.

Gains of roughly 1% in the last two sessions helped the FTSE 100 recoup some of the losses seen in August, when it suffered its worst monthly fall since October last year due to heightened concerns over global trade and recession.

Friday's surge has put the index course for its biggest monthly gain since April, albeit a flat quarter.

Leading gains on the main index, Britain's second-largest homebuilder, Persimmon (L: ), jumped 5.2% after the brokerage Jefferies said Brexit risks had been overplayed in the sector, and upgraded the stock.

A sub-index of housebuilders ( ) touched its highest level in almost a year.

Offshore oilfield services contractor Gulf Marine (L: ) pared earlier gains to end 2% up after signing a deal with lenders to provide cash till year-end, while mid-cap utility Pennon Group (L: ) scaled a more than one-year high after maintaining targets.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/ftse-100-hovers-near-twomonth-high-as-boe-rate-cut-prospect-hits-pound-1971291#comments,0.065,0.821,0.114,0.9744

UK100 -0.39% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio HSBA -0.84% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BP +0.79% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.53% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio BAES +0.79% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Passive income has become somewhat of a buzzword in the past few years, and is now the goal of many investors. At its simplest level, it refers to gaining an income without any ongoing effort – such as working – following an initial investment of time or money.

Though it can be achieved through a number of different avenues, I believe investing for passive income is one of the easiest and safest ways to achieve it. Easy, that is, if you know what to look for. Let’s look at my three main considerations for investing for passive income.

Dividends Dividends are how you earn passive income from buying shares. Dividends are the way a company distributes profits to its shareholders, and for anyone looking for passive income, is the first thing that needs considering.

Specifically, you want a dividend yield that offers a level of income worth having. The problem is that in many cases, a company offering a high dividend may be trying to entice investors to ignore problems it has elsewhere.

In my experience, a yield of between 4% and 6% is a good, reasonable level to look out for. In today’s low interest rate environment this far exceeds savings or bond rates.

Growth rate Another key element to consider with dividends is their growth rate. Though it is useful to consider dividends in terms of a percentage, they are actually paid in pence per share. This means that if a company offers the same dividend year in and year out as the share price grows, it will yield less and less over time.

To avoid this, you need to look for consistent dividend growth over at least the previous five years. The past is not always a predictor of the future, of course, but a company that has shown a commitment to dividend payments likely values its shareholders.

Capital The final issue to consider is the simple fact that you do not want to lose your initial capital. This is often easier said than done, and an area where you need to be particularly careful with shares.

Even the oldest, strongest firm can lose money in its share price, but over the long run, solid blue-chip firms have been shown to outpace inflation and generate capital gains.

For a safer income investment then, I recommend looking predominantly at blue-chip firms with well-established brands. You should create a portfolio that diversifies across sectors and expect to be holding the stock for at least five years.

Examples I back With these criteria in mind, there are a number of stocks that I consider to be prime candidates. Oil giants Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) and BP (LSE: LON: ) for example, are both yielding about 6% and have shown consistent dividend growth in the past five years.

In the riskier sector of finance, banking giant HSBC (LSE: HSBA) is currently yielding 6.4%, while the more defensive stock BAE Systems (LON: ) (LSE: BA) currently yields about 4%.

These shares are a good place to consider starting, but by matching the three criteria of a well-branded blue chip, yielding between 4% and 6%, that has shown consistent dividend growth over the past five years, you can start to generate passive income with your own choices and even the smallest level of capital.

852,212,SHEL,2019-09-18,London Deals for WeWork Buildings Falter Amid IPO Market Fallout By Bloomberg,"Published Sep 18, 2019 13:23 Updated Sep 18, 2019 13:54

SHEL +0.53% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

(Bloomberg) -- Deals for two major London buildings leased mostly to WeWork are on the ropes.

Saudi-based Sidra Capital has pulled out of a 90 million-pound ($112 million) deal to buy 70 Wilson Street near London’s financial district as the flexible-office giant’s planned initial public offering got an increasingly rocky reception from investors, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private negotiations.

Separately, talks have stalled on the sale of WeWork Waterloo, which the company describes as the largest co-working facility in the world, according to other people with knowledge of the negotiations. Singapore-based Bright Ruby Resources Pte Ltd. had agreed last month to buy it and an adjoining property leased to Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc for about 850 million pounds. It’s not clear what impact WeWork’s roller-coaster IPO has had on Bright Ruby’s appetite for the deal, the people said.

We Co., which owns WeWork, pushed back its IPO this week to buy time to overcome concerns about its governance, slashed valuation and business prospects. The decision sent the company’s bonds plunging and added a sour note to a medley of high-profile, but frequently disappointing, IPOs this year.

The delay also comes at a critical time for major backer SoftBank Group Corp., which is trying to raise money for a successor to its Vision Fund. SoftBank’s biggest investors, including Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, are reconsidering how much to commit to the new vehicle as the Japanese conglomerate’s bet on WeWork sours.

WeWork has lease obligations of $47 billion and continues to burn cash to fund its rapid expansion, putting pressure on the company to raise new capital. But the company’s model of signing long leases, then renting out short-term space to members, as well as its complex relationship with co-founder Adam Neumann, have polarized investors assessing the planned offering.

WeWork Waterloo, originally known as Two Southbank Place, is fully leased to WeWork and boasts a skate ramp, retro arcade games and a library in its cavernous lobby. Negotiations on a sale, which were first reported by React News in August, are ongoing and there’s no certainty about their outcome, one of the people said.

Representatives of Almacantar SA, the developer selling the buildings in London’s Waterloo district, and WeWork declined to comment. A representative for Bright Ruby wasn’t immediately able to comment.

Sidra Capital was in talks to buy 70 Wilson Street in London’s Shoreditch district from a venture led by Columbia Threadneedle Investments, the people said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's top court has allowed Geneva prosecutors to share with Italy material they seized more than three years ago that could shed light on a case involving oil majors Eni (MI: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and corrupt payments in Nigeria.

In a ruling announced on Monday, the Federal Tribunal rejected Nigerian defendant Emeka Obi's appeal to prevent photocopies of items and computer files from his confiscated suitcase from being sent to Italian crimefighters.

The Swiss court said the case did not fall within the narrow scope of permissible appeals to the Lausanne-based tribunal.

Geneva prosecutors have been reviewing material in the suitcase to decide what can be shared with Italian authorities.

The Federal Tribunal had already rejected last year an appeal by Obi to prevent his suitcase from being unsealed.

In that ruling, the court said the confiscated material - including documents, an external hard drive, British and African passports, and USB keys - could have ""potential pertinence"" in the criminal investigation and the sealing could be lifted without violating Swiss law.

Obi, through his lawyers, has denied any wrongdoing.

""Our client has maintained his innocence in regards to the various allegations made by the Milan prosecutors and is confident that the final evaluation of the contents of his bag will confirm this,"" they had said last year.

An Italian judge said last year that Eni and Shell were aware their 2011 purchase of a Nigerian oilfield would result in corrupt payments to Nigerian politicians and officials.

Eni and Shell have denied any wrongdoing.

The two companies bought the OPL 245 offshore field for about $1.3 billion (1 billion pounds) in a deal that spawned one of the industry's largest corruption scandals. It is alleged that about $1.1 billion of the total was siphoned to agents and middlemen.

The Milan judge made the comment in her written reasons for the September conviction of Obi and Italian Gianluca Di Nardo, both middlemen in the OPL 245 deal, for corruption. The pair were jailed for four years.

Obi and Di Nardo have been tried separately from Eni and Shell, which also face corruption allegations over the same deal in a hearing that is expected to drag on for months.

Obi brought the Swiss case to keep the contents of the suitcase - seized in Geneva in April 2016 in an inquiry unrelated to the corruption case - from being shared with foreign authorities.

Its confiscation led Geneva prosecutors to open a criminal case for suspected corruption of foreign officials and money-laundering. Days later Italian authorities requested judicial assistance, arguing that the suitcase and its contents had been deliberately stashed in Geneva.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/top-swiss-court-lets-prosecutors-help-italian-oil-corruption-probe-1967667,0.068,0.883,0.049,-0.9127

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facing rising anger from young people for their role in accelerating climate change, chief executives of major oil companies launched an effort on Monday to burnish their image on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Action Summit.

The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, representing 13 major global oil companies, held meetings with around 20 students and young professionals aimed at laying the groundwork for a long-term plan to engage with young people.

It took place as top oil company CEOs, including BP (LON: ) Plc's Bob Dudley and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc's Ben van Beurden, met to discuss the industry's response to climate change, while Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg angrily condemned world leaders and industry for failing to act quickly enough on the issue.

""It's about dialogue and to have dialogue you have to have transparency,"" said Eldar Sætre, CEO of Norwegian oil company Equinor ASA, who said handling youth anger towards his industry is ""tough.""

Geraldine Satre Buisson, a 28-year-old seeking a Ph.D. in climate change policy and science communication at Imperial College London, said she participated in Friday's global climate strike, in which more than 4 million people walked out of school or work to demand emergency action on climate change.

Buisson took part in Monday's dialogue reluctantly but said she felt it was necessary to channel the anger she felt on the streets into action by meeting face-to-face with oil executives.

""I felt generally that we had an opportunity to be heard but I am not sure that being heard will translate into action,"" she said, adding that the executives dodged questions about Thunberg.

Faiza Haq, a 24-year-old student at Columbia University in New York studying energy and the environment, said when she went into the room, ""I didn’t go with a feeling of trust.""

While she said the industry is taking positive steps by making some investments in renewable energy and technology to capture and store carbon, she suspects the companies have been pushing Washington to deregulate their industry.

""They are doing things that are very positive, but what is the transparency that is happening?"" she said.

The night before the event around 40 protesters gathered outside a New York hotel hosting a private Oil and Gas Climate Initiative dinner. Some held up ""Wanted"" signs emblazoned with the faces and names of the CEOs of Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: )

The protesters chanted: ""No gas, no oil - keep the carbon in the soil!"" and ""They knew, they lied, they need to pay!""

""I am here to tell fossil fuel companies that our lives matter and that climate change is not affecting us in 10 years but right now,"" said Mayana Torres, 19, a student and volunteer with SustainUS, a youth-led movement campaigning to bar fossil fuel companies from influencing climate policy.

Christina Figueres - the former executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, who helped finalise the Paris Agreement - told oil executives at a session later on Monday that they have to take bolder action or risk becoming obsolete.

""The stigma this industry has acquired does not allow you to attract the best and brightest,"" she said. ""And you need the best and brightest for a transformation.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/under-pressure-on-climate-big-oil-pitches-to-the-young-1968363,0.074,0.839,0.087,0.9436

LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (NYSE: ) has upgraded its outlook for Europe's top oil and gas companies, forecasting sharp growth in shareholder returns while striking a downbeat note on the pace of a transition to low-carbon energy.

The note, titled ""Reality check needed on 'Black Gold'"", was published on Monday, when crude prices surged nearly 20% following weekend attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. Crude's gains pulled up the share prices of oil firms.

JPMorgan's bullish tone comes amid calls from some investors and activists for reduced investment in oil and gas companies due to a gradual shift towards cleaner, renewable energy.

The brokerage Redburn downgraded the sector earlier this month, citing increased risks from a global transition to renewables.

JPMorgan said firms including Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), BP (L: ) and Total (PA: ) had in recent years started adapting to lower oil demand by cutting costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from their operations.

""While some progress is being made on (European majors') carbon intensity ... there is further work to do,"" Christyan Malek, JPMorgan's top European oil and gas analyst, said in the note.

""We believe decarbonising will be far harder than current consensus assumes, especially in the industrial and transport sectors.""

The European oil majors have lagged major stock indices including London's FTSE ( ) so far this year and underperformed relative to Brent crude futures ( ).

JP Morgan, in upgrading Europe's top energy companies, cited a stronger oil price outlook, a relatively weak share performance and a lower carbon intensity from the firms' operations.

It also pointed to forecasts that shareholder returns would rise to 28% of the companies' market capitalisation by 2022.

The top U.S. investment bank forecast oil demand by 2040 would grow by 4% from current levels, peaking between 2035 and 2040, similar to projections by a number of oil companies.

The projection nevertheless falls short of targets set out in the 2015 U.N.-backed Paris Climate Agreement to lower carbon emissions to ""net zero"" by the end of the century, a move aimed at limiting global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius.

European oil producers have faced investor pressure in recent years to hit the Paris goals, setting targets to cut emissions and increasing spending on renewable energy.

Graphic: European oil majors' fiscal breakevens , https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/OILMAJORS-JPMORGAN/0H001QX7E8G8/eikon.png

The bank maintained its ""overweight"" recommendation on Shell and BP while upgrading Total from ""neutral"" to ""overweight"".

The three firms, it said, were best positioned among their peer group to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to the energy transition while offering strong cash returns.

JPMorgan upgraded Norway's Equinor (OL: ) to ""neutral"" while downgrading Italy's Eni (MI: ) to an ""underweight"" recommendation and initiating coverage of Austria's OMV (VI: ) with an ""overweight"" rating.

The rating changes mean the outlook for the group of companies has shifted to bullish, Malek said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/jpmorgan-boosts-big-oil-rating-downplays-pace-of-energy-transition-1963848,0.058,0.846,0.096,0.9488

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Trade wars and the threat of Brexit were acting as a ""profit warning"" for the Dutch economy, and the government intended to increase investments to protect its future, Dutch King Willem-Alexander told parliament on Tuesday, in an address prepared by the government.

The address came as Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government released details of its 2020 budget, which featured spending increases on healthcare and housing. The government also confirmed it plans to create a national investment fund next year to take advantage of its ability to borrow at negative rates.

""The approaching Brexit casts its shadow forward,"" the monarch said in his annual speech. ""It's a profit warning for the short term and the long term, that forces us to consider how the Netherlands will earn money in the future and remain a country with good social services.""

The Dutch government estimates it will lose 1.2% of GDP by 2030 if Britain, a key trading partner, leaves the European Union.

Dutch GDP growth is forecast to slow to 1.8% this year and 1.5% in 2020, according to forecasts by the economic policy office CPB.

The government also confirmed plans to keep the corporate tax at 25% in 2020 and lower it to 21.7% in 2021. It also said it would reduce some tax deductions that have allowed multinationals such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) and Philips (AS: ) to cut their Dutch corporate tax bill to zero.

The moves to increase spending are modest: the country will still run an estimated surplus of about 0.3% of gross domestic product, down from a 1.2% surplus this year. This comes a week after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi urged Germany and the Netherlands to spend more to avert a downturn in the euro zone.

Among key spending increases earmarked for 2020 were 350 million euros (£310 million) for affordable housing, 300 million euros on youth healthcare programs, 134 million euros for immigration and asylum, 61 million euros on the judiciary and 51 million euros for defence.

Willem-Alexander said the government had a ""growth agenda"" and would present a draft plan next year for the national investment fund, which would target education and infrastructure.

""National debt is under control and the (tax) burden can be lowered,"" he said in his address to both houses of Parliament gathered in the 13th-century Hall of Knights in the Hague.

After years of austerity following the global financial crisis, the Dutch government is forecast to have a national debt of just 47.6% of GDP in 2020, well below European budget requirements.",https://uk.investing.com//news/economy/trade-wars-brexit-are-profit-warning-dutch-king-says-1964185,0.081,0.853,0.067,-0.8651

(Reuters) - Oil and gas companies stood out in a gloomy session for European stock markets on Monday as an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities thrust crude prices higher, while heightening geopolitical concerns among investors.

The oil & gas index surged 2.8% to log its biggest percentage gain since January 2019, after the weekend's attack on the world's largest crude exporter disrupted more than 5% of global oil supply.

Oil prices soared as much as 20%, with posting its biggest intraday gain since the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis before easing off its peaks.

That helped energy-heavy Norwegian stocks jump 1.65%, boosted by Equinor and Aker BP (LON: ), the top gainer on .

Oil majors BP, Shell (LON: ) and Total jumped between 2.5% and 4%, while UK and Irish-based explorer Tullow Oil (LON: ) gained 8.4% after the firm said it plans to drill three or more exploration wells in Guyana.

Most other major European sectoral indexes fell, with shares in Airbus and French luxury goods exporters sliding as the European Union acknowledged it may face U.S. tariffs in a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies.

Airbus shares dropped 3.4%, while LVMH, Christian Dior and Hermes fell between 2.8% and 4.5%.

""Despite a strong lift for oil stocks, the larger, more liquid, higher-capitalisation indices in western Europe with the strongest global links were all weak,"" City Index's Ken Odeluga wrote in a note.

""It looks like investors assess the situation as having potential to further weigh on a geopolitical landscape already beset by the slowing global economy, Brexit and trade.""

The Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls Yemen's capital claimed responsibility for the attack, although a Saudi-led coalition said on Monday the attacks were carried out with Iranian weapons.

President Donald Trump said Washington was ""locked and loaded"" to hit back.

Adding to some weak indicators from China last week, industrial production in the world's second largest economy grew at its weakest pace in 17-1/2 years in August.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended down 0.6%, ending a four-day winning streak, while trade-sensitive German shares dropped 0.7%.

The weekend's events halted a march higher in European stocks, which logged their fourth week of gains on Friday as investors moved back into cyclical sectors amid signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks.

After the European Central Bank cut rates deeper into negative territory last week and relaunched bond purchases with no scheduled end-date, all eyes are now on the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week.

The central bank is widely expected to ease interest rates and signal further moves.

Travel and leisure stocks dropped 0.6%, dragged down by shares of airlines Ryanair Holdings, Air France KLM SA and EasyJet PLC on worries of higher fuel costs hurting profits.

(Reuters) - Britain's blue-chip index dropped on Monday as non-oil stocks took a hit from mounting geopolitical risks and growth concerns after crude prices rose due to the attacks on Saudi Arabian production facilities.

The FTSE 100 ( ) slipped 0.6% overall, but a 4% gain in BP (L: ) and 2% in Shell (L: ) kept a lid on losses.

The FTSE 250 ( ) was down 0.7%.

The attacks on Saturday shut about 5% of global supply, triggering the biggest intra-day percentage gain in since the Gulf War in 1991.

""It looks like investors assess the situation as having potential to further weigh on a geopolitical landscape already beset by the slowing global economy, Brexit and trade,"" City Index analyst Ken Odeluga said.

Crude prices retreated after U.S. President Donald Trump approved the use of his country's emergency oil stockpile to ensure stable supply.

Still, losses were seen across the board in all but the energy and utilities sectors. The travel and leisure index ( ) that also houses airline stocks dropped 1%.

Asia-facing financial shares and miners also weighed on the main index, after data showed that China's slowdown deepened in August with growth in industrial production at its weakest for 17-1/2 years.

The FTSE banking index ( ) lost 1.7% and the mining index ( ) slid 1.6%.

Meanwhile, the FTSE oil & gas index ( ) jumped 2.8% on its best day in seven months. Premier Oil (L: ) and Tullow Oil (L: ) gained the most on the index.

""Explorers like Premier Oil, Cairn Energy and Tullow Oil were even bigger beneficiaries as they stand to gain the most from supply shortages and disruption to existing channels,"" Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said.

In news-related moves, telecoms company BT (L: ) rose 3.4% to be among the top gainers on the main index after its chief executive bought shares in the company.

Wealth manager St. James's Place (L: ) fell 2.7%, with traders citing a report that said the company would likely axe a bonus scheme for its partners.

African diamond miner Petra Diamonds (L: ) slipped 5.8% to hit an all-time low after it missed annual profit forecasts, as a Sino-U.S. trade row and protests in Hong Kong dented demand in big Asian markets.

On the Brexit front, the outcome of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Luxembourg visit pushed the pound lower after heated remarks by Luxembourg's prime minister showed the gap between the British and European Union positions remained far apart.

At home, Britain's top markets watchdog called for EU action to avoid Brexit disruption and said overlapping British and European share trading rules would damage markets ""to no good end"".",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/ftse-100-drops-on-weak-china-data-soaring-crude-prices-lift-oil-majors-1962838,0.112,0.752,0.136,0.9618

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors managing $15 trillion (£12 trillion) in assets turned up the heat on oil and gas sector on Wednesday ahead of a United Nations summit in New York aimed at accelerating efforts to fight climate change.

Energy companies are on the front line of the global transition to a low-carbon economy, with investors potentially on the hook for hefty losses if the companies do not overhaul their business models in time.

In its most detailed analysis of the energy sector, the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) said 31 out of 109 energy firms were aligned with commitments governments have so far made under the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

However, of the 50 oil and gas companies assessed, just two - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) and BP Plc (L: ) - were aligned with existing national emissions targets. The remaining 29 companies on track to meet such commitments were all electric utilities.

""We, as a major institutional investor, are concerned that transition risk - the large and growing gap between government targets and company ambitions - is a major source of investment risk,"" said Helena Viñes Fiestas, global head of stewardship and policy at BNP Paribas (PA: ) Asset Management.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wants governments to make more ambitious pledges to cut emissions at the U.N. summit on Monday, which he convened to boost the Paris Agreement ahead of a crucial implementation phase next year.

Current pledges by governments to cut emissions are nowhere near enough to meet the Paris target of keeping the rise in average global temperatures to well below two degrees Celsius, with a goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

That means that some companies' targets can bring them in line with existing national plans under the Paris Agreement, but remain far from adequate to avert the worst of the natural disasters and economic damage forecast for a warming world.

TPI, which includes major pension funds and asset owners, said none of the oil and gas companies it assessed are doing enough to align their businesses with the changes needed to meet the Paris temperature targets.

The findings echoed a report published this month by financial think-tank Carbon Tracker, which found that big oil companies had approved $50 billion of projects since last year that will not be viable if governments implement the Paris deal.

By contrast, TPI found that nearly half of the utility companies are aligned with national commitments already made under the Paris Agreement, and more than 20% are on target to meet a temperature rise of below 2 degrees Celsius, the TPI said.

That is partly because some utilities have been quicker to pivot their business models toward renewable energy than oil and gas companies.

""There is no doubt that oil and gas companies are in a difficult position in navigating the transition to a low carbon economy,"" Euan Stirling, global head of stewardship and ESG investing at Aberdeen Standard Investments.

""That makes it all the more important that we have at least some sector constituents who are starting to respond to the climate crisis by repositioning their businesses from the top down in the same way that many power generators have.""

The TPI is one of several investor initiatives launched in recent years aimed at helping boost the quality and effectiveness of investor engagement with companies on climate. Among its other 45 signatories are firms including Legal & General Investment Management and U.S. pension scheme CaLPERs.

(Reuters) - Britain's blue-chip index ended flat on Tuesday as losses in oil major BP , triggered by a report that Saudi Arabia's output could be back up quicker than expected, were countered by gains in so-called defensive sectors.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were modestly higher after early trading on Wednesday, content to mark time ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, which won’t come until after the European close.

Sentiment was helped by the partial pull-back in crude prices after Saudi Arabia said it would be pumping oil at full capacity again by the end of the month. That removes a key source of risk from Europe’s equity markets, given the negative impact on demand on a region that is a big net importer of oil and gas.

Even so, oil and gas stocks continued to attract bids.

is still trading comfortably above the $60 level that most European majors need to cover their investment needs and dividend obligations. As such, that adds an extra level of certainty to the relatively high dividend yields that most of them offer.

According to data compiled by Investing.com, European oil and gas majors currently trade at the following dividend yields:

Repsol (MC: ) - 6.41%

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Class A - 6.29%

BP (LON: ) - 6.13%

ENI (MI: ) - 5.87%

Total SA (PA: ) - 5.48%

Equinor ASA - 4.82%

Healthy cash flows for oil companies of course are generally bad news for their customers. As such, Deutsche Post (DE: ), the owner of DHL, was the biggest loser on the German Wednesday, falling 2.0% after rival FedEx's (NYSE: ) profit warning late in New York on Tuesday. Swiss-based logistics group Kuehne & Nagel (SIX: ) was also down 2.4%, although U.K.-based Royal Mail (LON: ) escaped collateral damage, rising 0.6% by 5 AM ET.

The benchmark was up less than 0.1% at 389.54, while the U.K. was up 0.2% and the Italian led the way with a 0.5% gain, recovering after Tuesday’s dip. Italian assets were hit by the decision of former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to split from the Democratic Party along with a number of senior allies. However, the group will still support the new governing coalition. In similar vein, Spain’s rose 0.1%, shrugging off the prospect of yet another election after King Felipe called time on Pedro Sanchez’ minority left-wing government.

Investing.com -- Oil and gas stocks surged and airlines and other cyclicals suffered Monday as the world was forced to rip up its oil price forecasts in the wake of the attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities at the weekend.

By 5 AM ET, BP (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) had shot to the top of the U.K. , rising 3.8% and 2.8% respectively, while there were more spectacular gains for pure upstream plays such as Tullow Oil (LON: ) and Lundin Petroleum, which rose 8.9% and 6.7%.

Europe’s other majors, Equinor (OL: ), Total (PA: ), ENI (MI: ) and Repsol (MC: ), all rose between 4.3% and 1.5%.

Another big gainer was Norway’s Seadrill (OL: ), which had appeared to be skidding toward a second insolvency process as oil prices wilted in August. It rose 7.0% by 4:30 AM ET and is now up 60% from its low at the start of September.

Oil and gas contractors fared less well, reflecting the fact that while a windfall is guaranteed to anyone producing oil right now, it’s still not clear whether the sudden rise will last long enough to incentivize more investment in alternative supply. Analysts at Rystad Energy predicted last week that the oilfield services sector was headed for a recession next year, after three years of expansion (although chief sectoral analyst Audun Martinsen still sees the sector returning to growth from 2021).

By 5 AM, Technip (PA: ) was up 3.7%, while Saipem (MI: ) was up 2.0% and Petrofac (LON: ) was up 2.1%

As far as initial reactions are concerned, airlines provided the mirror image to the oil sector’s gains. The sector has been struggling with overcapacity and weaker demand in any case, and is not well-positioned to withstand a lasting oil price shock.

Air France KLM (PA: ) was the biggest faller, losing 4.0%, while discount flyer Wizz Air (LON: ) fell 2.8% and Lufthansa (DE: ) fell 2.6%. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (OL: ) was the outlier, rising 6.4% amid progress on restructuring two of its biggest bonds.

Overall, markets took the news from the Middle East badly, and sentiment was hurt further by weak economic data out of China, where retail sales and fixed asset investment growth fell short of expectations and grew at the slowest pace since 2002, according to data compiled by Investing.com

The benchmark was down 0.6%, while the German fell by 0.7% and the Italian by 1.2%.

(Bloomberg) -- India is considering a plan to sell the nation’s second-largest state refiner and fuel retailer to a global oil company as it explores options to give up its controlling stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp., people with knowledge of the matter said.

The government is keen to lure multinational companies in the domestic fuel retailing to boost competition and shake up a sector that’s long been dominated by state-run firms, the people said, asking not to be identified as the plan is not public. The Business Standard newspaper reported on Sept. 2 government’s plan to sell a majority stake in the company. It holds 53.3% in BPCL.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has set a record target of raising 1.05 trillion rupees ($14.8 billion) in the current fiscal year from sale of state firms. The government’s budget gap goal of 3.3% of GDP is at risk due to sluggish revenue collections on the back a growth slowdown, limiting the government’s ability to spend on infrastructure and welfare programs.

Offloading its holding in Bharat Petroleum can help meet more than 40% of the aim based on the closing price on Sept. 12. Finance ministry spokesman Rajesh Malhotra could not be immediately reached for a comment.

Shares of Bharat Petroleum gained as much as 7.1%, touching day’s high of 411.55 rupees in Mumbai. That compares with a 0.5% gain in the benchmark S&P index.

Early Stage

The talks are at an early stage and it’s unclear how long it will take to finalize a decision and what option the government will choose, the people added. A move to privatize BPCL will parliament’s approval.

Saudi Aramco is targeting refining deals in India, while Russia’s Rosneft (MCX: ) has already invested in oil refining and fuel marketing. Others such as Total (NYSE: ), Royal Dutch Shell (AS: ) and BP (LON: ) are also expanding into fuel retailing in India. The International Energy Agency expects energy demand to more than double by 2040.

An earlier attempt to sell state refiners Hindustan Petroleum Corp. to a single investor and Bharat Petroleum to the public was stalled by a Supreme Court order in 2003 following protests by labor and political groups.

Bharat Petroleum was previously Burmah Shell (LON: ), which in 1970s was nationalized by an act of parliament. Burmah Shell, set up in the 1920s, was an alliance between Royal Dutch Shell and Burmah Oil Co. and Asiatic Petroleum (India).",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/india-mulls-selling-stake-in-refiner-to-overseas-oil-firm-1961979,0.032,0.897,0.071,0.9584

By Liz Hampton

SMILEY, Texas (Reuters) - At a dusty drilling site east of San Antonio, shale producer EOG Resources Inc (N: ) recently completed its latest well using a new technology developed by a small services firm that promises to slash the cost of each by $200,000 (£161,956.4).

The technology, called electric fracking and powered by from EOG's own wells instead of costly diesel fuel, shows how shale producers keep finding new ways to cut costs in the face of pressures to improve their returns.

E-frac, as the new technology is called, is being adopted by EOG, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ), Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ) and others because of its potential to lower costs, reduce air pollution and operate much quieter than conventional diesel-powered frac fleets. Investment bank Tudor, Pickering Holt & Co analyst George O'Leary estimates e-fracs could lop off up to $350,000 from the cost of shale wells that run $6 million to $8 million apiece.

While a handful of oil producers are capturing savings from lower well costs, the picture is less rosy for oilfield service providers. These systems can cost them up to twice that of conventional fleets to build. A rapid uptake could worsen the economics for a sector cutting staff and idling equipment as oil producers pare spending. That leaves this potential breakthrough technology in the hands of small service providers without the means to fully exploit it.

ONE-SIDED SAVINGS Jeff Miller, chief executive of Halliburton Co (N: ), the top U.S. provider of fracking services, said his firm has tested the technology but has no desire to promote it.

""Halliburton will be really slow around frac,"" Miller said, referring to the costs of updating diesel systems to electric. Converting the industry's 500 frac fleets would cost $30 billion, he estimated, too steep a price for oilfield firms, he said.

He recently advised an oil producer interested in the technology that the benefits of deploying e-fracs ""work for you, they don't work for us,"" he said at Barclays (LON: ) energy conference this month.

Halliburton, Schlumberger NV (N: ) and others have idled scores of diesel-powered fleets this year as producers cut spending due to flat to lower oil and gas prices. Consultancy Primary Vision estimates the number of active fleets in the U.S. fell 19% since April to around 390.

Halliburton cut 8% of its North American workforce and reported second-quarter profit fell 85% over the year-ago period in part because of equipment writedowns and severance costs due to weak demand for its frac service.

""Every week that goes by I get more and more negative about e-frac due to the harsh imbalance between the benefits achieved by the oil company and the costs incurred by the service company,"" said Richard Spears, a consultant to top oilfield services suppliers.

Schlumberger paid $430 million in late 2017 to acquire a diesel-powered frac fleet from rival Weatherford International, hoping to expand shale services. A spokesperson declined to comment on e-frac.

This month newly-named CEO Olivier Le Peuch disclosed plans to write down investments that were ""based on a much higher activity outlook with the ambition of achieving economies of scale.""

""HARD TO JUSTIFY""

E-frac supplier Evolution Well Services, which supplied the equipment and crew for EOG's Eagle Ford shale operation, is one of a handful of smaller oilfield firms pioneering the systems.

Evolution operates six e-frac fleets - mobile collections of high-pressure pumps powered by gas turbine generators - and plans to roll out a seventh next year. U.S. Well Services, another e-frac provider, has agreements with Apache Corp (N: ) and Shell. Conventional pressure pumper ProPetro Holding Corp (N: ) also announced plans to bring a handful of e-frac fleets to the market.

""We'd kind of would like to"" build more systems without firm customer contracts, said Ben Bodishbaugh, CEO of Evolution, the only purely e-frac provider in North America. ""But in this market it's hard to justify,"" he said.

The reason: e-frac fleets can cost up to $60 million apiece because they rely on pricey gas turbines similar to those that run utilities to generate electricity, compared with as little as $30 million for a diesel-motor powered fleet. Evolution would not say how much its fleets cost, but noted it is below $60 million.

""It's a bad time for service companies to be ramping up very capital intensive service offerings,"" said Josh Young, chief investment officer with energy investor Bison Interests. ""People always feel pressure to invest in the next new things, but sometimes you shouldn't be investing in any of the things.""

Companies like Evolution and U.S. Well Services that already have e-frac fleets would be winners if the technology takes off, analysts from investment banker Tudor Pickering Holt & Co predict. E-frac accounts for about 3% of active fleets, and could reach between 25% and 33% in the next five years, Tudor estimated.

EOG began testing Evolution's gear in late 2016, and signed a multi-year agreement about six months later. The shale company, well known for its use of cutting edge technology, runs four of Evolution's fleets and plans to add a fifth next year.

The agreement with Evolution ""is an example of how we continue to find innovative solutions to both reduce our environmental footprint and improve the profitability of our business,"" said Billy Helms, EOG's chief operating officer. EOG is among the handful of top shale producers that generate more cash than they consume in drilling and shareholder dividends.

NO SOOT, LESS NOISE

At its Smiley, Texas, oil and gas well site, EOG's crew carried on casual conversations despite the whir of e-frac pumps. No one wears ear protection, which is common at conventional diesel fleets, and the towering white silos holding frac sand were gleaming during a visit in August. At a conventional frac site just up the road, the towers were black from diesel exhaust.

Evolution's Bodishbaugh said some oil and gas firms see less polluting e-frac as improving their standing with investors who rate environmental, social and governance (ESG) attributes in their investments.

""I’d say this year we’ve probably had more inbounds calls on the emissions profile than the economic savings,"" he said.

Paul Mecray III, a managing director for investment firm Tower Bridge Advisors who follows major service companies, said e-frac will only catch on if overall demand for oilfield services recovers.

""While it may be a good thing longer term, I think it will take a lot longer to catch on than people think,"" he said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/lowcost-fracking-offers-boon-to-oil-producers-headaches-for-suppliers-1961038,0.054,0.841,0.105,0.996

Actively-managed funds have declined in popularity in recent years due to the rise of low-cost tracker funds. Many investors are asking: why pay fund manager fees when a lot of fund managers fail to consistently beat the market? The shocking performance of Neil Woodford’s Equity Income fund in recent years won’t have helped the case for active management.

However, personally, I still believe there’s a place for actively-managed funds within a portfolio. I wouldn’t expect them to outperform the market at all times as the market is unpredictable in the short term. However, over a period of five years or longer, I’d expect plenty of fund managers to beat the market. With that in mind, here’s a look at three UK equity funds that have easily beaten tracker funds over the last five years.

Franklin UK Rising Dividend fund This fund flies under the radar of many UK investors, due to the fact that US investment manager Franklin Templeton is not as well known in the UK as some other companies. However, it has been an excellent performer over the last five years, returning around 48%, easily outperforming FTSE 100 tracker funds that have delivered total returns of around 30%.

What I like about this fund is that it mainly invests in companies that are increasing their dividends (dividend growth investing). This strategy can produce excellent results over time as not only do you pick up higher dividends, but the dividend growth tends to put upward pressure on share prices. Top holdings currently include Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), Unilever (LON: ), and Diageo (LON: ).

Available through Hargreaves Lansdown (LON: ) with an annual fee of just 0.55%, I think this is a top fund for those seeking capital growth and income.

Lindsell Train UK Equity Another UK equity fund that has easily beaten the FTSE 100 over the last five years is the Lindsell Train UK Equity fund. Over the last five years, it has returned an incredible 98%, nearly three times the return of the FTSE 100.

I also like the investment strategy here. Portfolio manager Nick Train focuses on high-quality stocks that are highly profitable and have strong competitive advantages and this approach seems to work very well for him. Top holdings are currently Relx, Diageo, and Unilever.

Investors should note that this is a concentrated fund, which does add risk. However, overall, I see it as a good option for those seeking growth. Fees are 0.51% through Hargreaves.

CFP SDL UK Buffettology fund Finally, check out the CFP SDL UK Buffettology fund. It is the top-performing UK equity fund on Hargreaves Lansdown over the last five years, returning a huge 108%.

This fund is run by Keith Ashworth-Lord of Sanford DeLand Asset Management. As the name of the fund suggests, the portfolio manager takes a Warren Buffett-esque approach to investing, looking for high-quality businesses at attractive prices. However, this fund is unique in that many of the firms it owns are smaller companies that are not in the FTSE 100. Top holdings currently include AB Dynamics, Games Workshop Group, and Bioventix.

Like the Lindsell Train UK Equity fund, this is a concentrated fund which adds risk. Fees are also quite high at 1.19% per year through Hargreaves. However, overall, I think it could be a good pick as part of a diversified portfolio for those seeking growth.

(Bloomberg) -- As bankers discussed Saudi Aramco’s initial public offering at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Dubai last week, a drone attack was being planned to hit the heart of its operations over the weekend. It caused Saudi Arabia to halve its oil output and may cut the valuation of Aramco’s milestone deal.

The giant oil producer has accelerated preparations for a share sale that could happen as soon as November in Riyadh. Dozens of bankers from Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ). to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) & Co. met last week to work on the deal, with analyst presentations scheduled for Sept. 22, people familiar with the matter have said.

“Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will push the company to demonstrate that it can effectively tackle terrorism or war challenges,” analysts led by Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East and North Africa research at the Eurasia Group, said in a report. “The attacks could complicate Aramco’s IPO plans.”

In an attack blamed by the U.S. on Iran, a swarm of drones laden with explosives set the world’s biggest crude-processing plant ablaze. Floating a minority stake of the oil giant, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., is part of Prince Mohammed’s efforts to modernize and diversify the economy.

The attacks underscored geopolitical tensions in the region. Iran denied responsibility, which was instead claimed by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Oil prices surged by the most on record to more than $71 a barrel after the strike removed about 5% of global supplies. The main Saudi stock index Sunday fell as much as 3.1%, leading losses in the Gulf.

Back in 2017, investors suspected that Saudi government-related funds swooped in to support the market after the imprisonment of local billionaires at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh. That also happened amid the international crisis following columnist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

Here’s more from analysts and investors:

Eurasia

“The latest attack on Aramco facilities will have only a limited impact on interest in Aramco shares as the first stage of the IPO will be local. The international component of the sale would be more sensitive to geopolitical risks”

Current valuation estimates for Aramco and its assets might not fully account for geopolitical risks NOTE: Prince Mohammed, the architect of the IPO, has said he expects Aramco to be valued at over $2 trillion, but analysts see $1.5 trillion as more realistic



Al Dhabi Capital, Mohammed Ali Yasin

“I think this attack may delay the IPO even on the local exchange, and could affect the valuation negatively, as the investors have seen a live demonstration of the risk levels of the future revenues and business of the company. That was very low prior to this weekend attack”

“Aramco has one main source of revenue, oil. That is its strength, but now it is becoming its biggest weakness if it gets disrupted”

United Securities, Joice Mathew

This “will force investors to go back to the drawing board and re-evaluate their risk models on Aramco”

“Even though this is a rare event, which could be potentially categorized as 4 or 6 sigma levels, the geopolitical risk premium on Aramco’s valuation model would show a sharp increase”

“As far as the pricing is concerned, my view is that there may not be much of an impact if the government is contemplating a 1% listing on the Tadawul. I think the government has the power and ability to influence the decisions of anchor investors there”

Tellimer, Hasnain Malik

“Ultimately the security risk is not so acute that it outweighs oil price, oil output and free float drivers of the valuation”

This attack “also provides an opportunity for Aramco to demonstrate the redundancy and resilience of its supply chain by minimizing disruption to customers and thereby helping to mitigate the valuation impact of this risk”

Qamar Energy, Robin Mills

“It will be all but impossible to proceed with the IPO if there are ongoing attacks”

“Valuing Aramco like Shell (LON: ) or ExxonMobil (NYSE: ) gets us to about $1.2-1.4 trillion. But that would drop significantly if we apply company-specific risk factors”

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch government will get rid of certain deductions for multinational companies in 2021, leading to 250 million euros (222.90 million pounds) in extra tax revenues, national broadcaster NOS reported on Wednesday.

The NOS reported that deductions for losses made by foreign subsidiaries would be curtailed, citing unnamed sources.

I’ve been checking Cash ISA rates again, and the best easy access variable rate I can find today is 1.44%.

I explained recently how that doesn’t even match inflation and is guaranteed to lose you money in real terms, so why 7.8 million adults in the UK went for a Cash ISA in 2017-18 mystifies me.

Stocks & Shares By contrast, I say a Stocks & Shares ISA is a very good thing. With a maximum investment of £20,000 per year and all profits tax-free, it’s got to be the best vehicle for investing in shares for your long-term future.

But are shares as risky as many folk think? Over the long term, no. Newspapers print scare stories when the Footsie falls, but that makes for a good headline, unlike one saying “Top UK dividends still going well, no need to panic“.

To make the most of a Stocks & Shares ISA while minimising risk, I’d focus on dividends. But which five shares might I buy first?

No cuts here My first choice is Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ). It has suffered a bit of share price weakness over the past few years, but that’s pushed the prospective dividend yield up to 6.7%. Every few years, analysts fret about whether Shell will have to cut its dividend — but it hasn’t happened even once since the end of World War II. How about the end of our reliance on fossil fuels? I can’t see it happening in my lifetime.

Next up I’d add City of London Investment Trust, which has a simple goal — to outperform the total return of the over the long term. It’s been doing rather well at it too, and has been bringing home dividend yields of around 4%. But more importantly than the yield, City of London has lifted its dividend every year for more than 50 years in a row.

I like insurance I’d be hard pushed to not invest in an insurance company because, even though the business has its short-term ups and downs due to its very nature, it’s a really solid long-term generator of cash. I currently own Aviva (LON: ) shares myself, but here I’m looking for safety. Prudential (LON: ) is probably the safest, but its yield is low, so my choice as the best compromise between risk and dividends is RSA Insurance Group with its well-covered 4.8% yield.

Housebuilding is another favourite sector, and this time I’m going to plump for Bovis Homes (LON: ). Before you shrink back in horror at the risk of a housing slowdown, I’ll tell you why I’m not worried. Housebuilding is cyclical, but over the long term there’s a chronic housing shortage. And there’s safety in the Bovis yield itself, currently at 10% — it won’t stay that high forever, but it could be slashed by 50% and still be attractive.

Top manager Finally, I’m going for Man Group, the FTSE’s only listed hedge fund manager. It’s a firm whose year-by-year earnings are erratic, but I’d expect that from any investment manger. And it’s keeping its dividend conservative but progressive, and even then we’re looking at a forecast yield of 4.4%.

With stocks like these on offer, I think I’d rather be dead in a ditch than invest in a Cash ISA.

Given that I spend my days writing about investing, one question that I often get asked by friends, family, and acquaintances is: “How should I invest a small amount of money today?” It’s a tough question to answer because everyone’s financial goals are different, and the kinds of investments that I like to hold in my ISA aren’t necessarily going to be suitable for everyone. That said, if I had to invest, say £1,000, today, here’s what I’d do.

The right account The first thing I’d do is open a tax-efficient investment account. I’d do this through Hargreaves Lansdown (LON: ) (disclaimer: I’m a Hargreaves Lansdown shareholder) as I think its investment platform is brilliant, and the customer service is excellent.

If I wanted an investment account that allowed me to access my money at any time, I’d open a Stocks & Shares ISA. In this type of account, all capital gains and income are tax-free and you can contribute £20,000 per year.

However, if I was saving for retirement, I’d either open a Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) or a Lifetime ISA (this is only open to those aged 18-39). The former comes with tax relief meaning that if you put in £1,000 the government will top up your contribution by another £250 (higher-rate taxpayers can claim more tax relief), while the latter comes with 25% bonuses on contributions up to £4,000 per year. Capital gains and income are tax-free in these accounts too.

Choosing my investments Once I had my account open, I’d look to deploy my money into the stock market, as the stock market is a proven long-term wealth generator. While many investors prefer to invest in stocks listed in their home country, I’d want some exposure to international stocks too as many top companies are listed overseas.

Now, £1,000 is not really enough to buy individual securities because trading commissions will hurt your returns. For example, if I wanted to buy 10 stocks to diversify my portfolio, commissions would be around £120, meaning I’d be down 12% before I’d even started.

So, what I’d do is invest in funds. This is where your money is pooled together with the money of others and managed by a professional fund manager. Through Hargreaves Lansdown, you can invest in funds from as little as £100.

Personally, I’d invest my £1,000 into the following three funds:

Franklin UK Rising Dividend fund – £400

Fundsmith Equity fund – £300

Lindsell Train Global Equity fund – £300

For my UK equity exposure, I’d go with the Franklin UK Rising Dividend fund. This invests in UK-listed dividend-paying companies, many of which are in the . It’s been a solid performer over the last five years, returning around 48%, compared to 30% for a FTSE 100 tracker.

The next two funds I have listed are both global equity funds, meaning they invest internationally. Both have a focus on high-quality companies. Over the last five years, these funds have returned around 160% and 170% respectively.

Owning these funds would give me a nice mix of UK-listed dividend stocks such as Shell (LON: ), Unilever (LON: ), and Reckitt Benckiser, providing stability for my portfolio, as well as plenty of exposure to faster-growing companies listed internationally.

Once my investments were set up, I’d hold for the long term and regularly add to my funds when I had more money to invest. As I always remind those who ask me how I’d invest £1,000, investing is a long-term game.

UK100 -0.39% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.51% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) is one of my favourite dividend stocks in the . And I’m not the only one who likes this business. The stock is a staple of income funds across the country, as well as around the world.

Last year, FTSE 100 blue-chips paid out a combined £91bn to shareholders. Shell accounted for around £12.3bn of that, making it one of the biggest dividend payers in the entire London market. At the time of writing the stock supports a dividend yield of 6.5%.

However, while Shell does have attractive dividend credentials, there’s no getting away from the fact that this company is just one business in an industry mired in controversy. Therefore, if you are looking for a steady income stream, it might be better to buy the FTSE 100 instead.

Diversification Shell is one of the biggest dividend payers in the FTSE 100, but it isn’t the only company that offers a dividend. Only a handful of blue-chips don’t provide a steady income for investors. In total, the FTSE 100 has an average dividend yield of 4.5%.

This level of income might not match that offered by Shell, but it is from a more diversified base of companies. In my opinion, it’s worth accepting this lower level of income for the additional security provided through diversification.

On top of the fact that the FTSE 100’s income stream is more diversified, it also seems to offer more in the way of capital growth. Right now, shares in Shell are changing hands for around 2,283p per B share. In September 2014, the shares were dealing for around 2,500p. So, the stock has actually produced a negative capital return for shareholders over the past five years.

The volatile price of oil has held back the group’s growth, and this will continue to be a problem for investors. As one of the world’s largest oil companies, Shell is always going to be beholden to the oil price.

On the other hand, there are only two big oil companies in the FTSE 100. The rest of the constituents are spread across sectors and industries. Their earnings are not dependent on the price of just one commodity. It should come as no surprise then that the FTSE 100 has produced a better return than the Shell share price over the past five years.

An investor who bought the index in 2014 has seen an annualised total return of 5.7% compared to just 3.7% for an investment in Shell.

Compounding returns The 2% gap between the performance of Shell and the FTSE 100 might not seem like much, but over the long term, these few percentage points will add up. For example, an interest rate of 3.7% will turn £1,000 into £2,081 over 20 years. The same £1,000 invested at a rate of 5.7% will grow into £3,077.

So overall, while Shell has some of the best dividend credentials in the FTSE 100, I think the index itself has better prospects for income and capital growth over the long term.

When I was in my teens, being a millionaire was mostly a marker of wealth rather than a necessity in retirement.

However, as I age I realise that for most of us saving enough money to achieve the goal of a million pounds in retirement is becoming increasingly important.

How much to save each month With the rising cost of living, longer life expectancies, and the growing number of years the average Brit will spend in retirement, each of us might actually need a million pounds to see us through our golden years comfortably.

The thought of saving a million pounds may sound daunting at first. But disciplined saving, smart investing, and the power of compound interest make it more achievable than most of us may have initially imagined.

For example, if we plan to retire in 30 years with a million pounds, simple arithmetics would say that we’d need to save at least £33,333 a year, or £2,777 a month.

Most of us might look at that number and feel overwhelmed! Thankfully, compound interest, which has a snowball effect on personal savings, may help us get to our destination more easily.

Long-term investing and the power of compounding By investing the money we save, we can make use of the power of compounding to help us grow our money.

In the UK, interest rates in bank savings accounts are low, but that does not mean we can’t find investments that can help our money compound much faster.

There are many shares and REITS listed on the or , averaging a sustainable annual dividend yield of about 5%. Any capital gains delivered by the stock would be an added bonus on top of the dividend.

If instead of putting our money in savings accounts, we invest in these shares or REITs each month, the amount we’d need to achieve a million pounds decreases dramatically.

To achieve a million pounds in 30 years, we need to invest about £1,250 each month (or £15,000) into a 5% yielding investment and continually reinvest the dividends.

And we would have slightly over £1 million at the end of 30 years.

The actual amount would depend on how many times we compound during the year and whether we invested at the start or the end of the month.

But, the message stays the same: the sooner we start to invest, the more money we are likely to have for retirement.

Several shares that pay robust dividends For many investors, the quest for steady income is becoming more important than ever. At The Motley Fool, my colleagues provide detailed coverage of share investing and retirement planning. They discuss many shares with impressive dividend yields that pay between 4%-6% annually on average.

Some companies may pay even more, although it would be important to do due diligence on each of these companies to see if their dividend yields are sustainable over time. A high yield is sometimes a reflection of weak investor sentiment about the sector or a depressed share price.

At present, tobacco firm Imperial Brands (LON: ) and telecoms giant BT both currently offer a yield of about 9%. WPP (LON: ), the multinational advertising group, and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), the oil major, each have a dividend yield of over 6%. At the lower end, pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, whose share price has been on the rise in 2019, pays slightly over 3% in dividend yield.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Essar Oil UK aims to lift processing of U.S. oil at its 200,000 barrels per day Stanlow refinery by March to 40% from 35% currently, its Chief Executive Officer S. Thangapandian said on Monday.

Speaking on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC), Thangapandian also told Reuters his company is in talks with some parties to sell a majority stake in its Stanlow Oil Terminal Ltd infrastructure business as it seeks to leverage its portfolio of assets.

He didn't identify potential buyers, but said the company was looking for ""a strategic partner"" for the majority stake in the infrastructure business, which carries a value of around $1 billion.

""Currently is making sense to us,"" Thangapandian said.

""As long as U.S oil is Brent-minus it is in the game,"" he said, referring to U.s. crude costing less than the international benchmark. Thangapandian said his company procures most of the U.S. oil from spot markets.

India's Essar Oil in 2011 acquired Stanlow refinery from Shell (LON: ).

Since then it had carried out modifications including shutting some units in an effort to make the refinery profitable. Thangapandian said Stanlow's current gross refining Margins is $9.5-10/bbl.

DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar has shortlisted international oil firms for a stake in its expanded North Field megaproject, Qatar Petroleum's chief executive told Reuters, but may still choose to go it alone unless majors offer it significant value.

The expansion of tiny but gas-rich Qatar's liquefied (LNG) facilities, already the world's largest, is one of the energy sector's most lucrative projects, and the world's top oil and gas majors have been racing to secure a stake.

Invitations to bid were sent out last month and the result is due to be announced in the first quarter of 2020, Saad al-Kaabi, who is also minister of state for energy, said - if Qatar decides to go with partners at all.

""We like the partnership model for many benefits. But because we don't need the partners, what's going out is basically a set of criteria that we have, to demonstrate to us what added value we get for Qatar if you come in,"" said Kaabi.

""Maybe they can give us something outside,"" he said, referring to LNG assets outside its domestic market.

QP wants to lift its LNG production to around 110 million tonnes per annum from today's 77 mtpa over the next five years by building four new production facilities.

Speaking from his office in Doha, Kaabi told Reuters that with the remaining contracts for its completion set to be awarded by the end of 2019, it was now asking a shortlist of majors to bid for a stake in the completed project.

He did not say how large a slice of the asset would be on offer, and declined to comment on which companies had been shortlisted.

Total, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), Shell (LON: ), and Italy's Eni have all offered QP stakes in prize assets abroad in a bid to secure a stake in the project.

Those assets, from stakes in sought-after exploration blocks to partnerships in petrochemical facilities, have helped transform QP into a significant international player in top gas and oil provinces from Mexico to Mozambique.

Although it says it is confident it can go it alone on developing its LNG resources, finding a home for all the extra supply it is expecting to come online is something oil majors can offer significant help with.

Qatar sees another 33 million tonnes of LNG flowing from the new facilities in 2024, and it will also need buyers for another 35 million tonnes as existing contracts expire over the next five years.

Kaabi declined to elaborate on the criteria that could help land partners a stake.

UPPING THE ANTE

He said QP's decision to self-finance the project, tender for its construction, and drill appraisal wells before offering partners a chance to buy in was part of a strategy to up the ante on what majors must now offer Qatar for a piece of its top asset.

A recently drilled appraisal well produced double the yield that was expected, a potentially good omen for what lies ahead, said Kaabi.

""It means we have a great project with great reserves, and the North Field is very prolific.""

But the super-wealthy country also faces significant challenges. Global LNG demand is flagging due among other things to the U.S.-China trade war at a time supply from competitors like Australia, the United States and Russia is rising.

Mounting tensions between the West and Iran in the Gulf may also affect the country's ability to ship out gas, while an economic embargo by its neighbours could hurt regional sales.

Kaabi said QP would seek more long-term LNG supply deals, including in Europe, after it last month signed an agreement for unloading services at Belgium's Zeebrugge LNG Terminal, securing its full capacity through 2044.

""We're going to do more in Europe - you're going to see,"" he said.

QP also expects to sign at least one upstream block in the United States - typically exploration rights or a field in development - before year-end as it looks to capitalise on its $10 billion Golden Pass LNG export terminal in Texas.

The terminal, a joint venture with Exxon Mobil, is seen coming online in 2024.

Despite the slew of assets acquired over the past year, Kaabi said QP remains hungry for more upstream exploration blocks around the world.

""Anywhere you find the hottest beds in the world, you'll see us there,"" he said.

ODESSA, Texas (Reuters) - Oil producers and their suppliers are cutting budgets, staffs and production goals amid a growing consensus of forecasts that oil and gas prices will stay low for several years.

The U.S. has 904 working rigs, down 14% from a year ago, and even that is probably too many, estimated Harold Hamm, chief executive of shale producer Continental Resources (N: ), which has reduced the number of rigs at work.

Bankruptcy filings by U.S. energy producers through mid-August this year have nearly matched the total for the whole of 2018. A stock index of oil and gas producers hit an all-time low in August, a sign investors are expecting more trouble ahead.

(For a graphic on debt from energy bankruptcy filings by year, see here https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-OIL-SLUMP/0H001QET785K/index.html)

""You're going to see activity drop across the industry,"" Earl Reynolds, CEO of Chaparral Energy (N: ), told Reuters at the EnerCom oil and gas conference last month.

The Oklahoma energy firm has slashed its workforce by nearly a quarter, trimmed its spending plan by 5%, and agreed to sell its headquarters and use some of the proceeds to reduce debt.

Investment bank Cowen & Co estimated last month that oil-and-gas producers spent 56% of their 2019 budgets through June, based on its review of 48 U.S. companies. It expects total spending this year to fall 11% over last year, based on proposed budgets.

The slowdown in drilling is spurring cost-cutting in oilfield services, including staff cuts and restructurings at top firms Schlumberger (NYSE: ) and Halliburton (NYSE: ) Co. Schlumberger plans a writedown yet to be determined this quarter, noting its results in North America have been ""under significant pressure,"" CEO Olivier Le Peuch said on Wednesday.

Halliburton is paring its North American workforce by 8% because of customer spending cuts, and National Oilwell Varco (NYSE: ) recently offered buyouts to its U.S. workers.

“The service sector I think is going to be flat,"" said Superior Drilling Services CEO Troy Meier, whose firm cancelled plans to add new machinery.

Such signs of a downturn come as the shale sector had just started generating the cash flow long demanded by investors, who have grown weary of drilling expansions without returns. Last quarter, a group of 29 top publicly-traded producers generated more in cash - $26 million (21 million pounds) - than it spent on drilling and dividends, according to Morningstar (O: ) data provided by the Sightline Institute and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. A year earlier, the same group had spent $2.4 billion more than it generated.

Despite that progress, many small to mid-sized shale firms are now pulling back on production targets amid the gloomy price projections.

A slowing oil industry could weigh on the United States economy. The boom in shale oil output added about 1 percent to U.S. gross domestic product, or 10% of growth, between 2010 to 2015, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. In Texas, the centre of shale oil production, energy employment dipped 1.8 percent in the first six months of 2019, according to the Dallas Fed. New drilling permits in the state fell 21% in July compared with the same month last year, according to state data.

MAJORS STAY THE COURSE

Any broader economic impact, however, could be limited by the massive investments in shale drilling by some of the world's biggest oil firms - Exxon Mobil (N: ), Chevron (N: ), Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and BP PLC (L: ). Even as small and mid-sized firms dial back, the majors continue to pour billions of dollars into years-long shale drilling plans. They have argued their integrated well-to-refinery networks allow them to control costs enough to withstand a sustained period of low prices.

Spokespeople for Exxon, Chevron and BP declined to comment on the industry downturn but referred to previous statements of their longterm commitment to shale. Shell did not respond to requests for comment.

Chevron has focused much of its production growth plans on shale, and CEO Michael Wirth has called its Permian Basin holdings in West Texas and eastern New Mexico the ""highest return use of our dollars.""

Exxon CEO Darren Woods told a Barclays (LON: ) energy conference on Sept. 4 that the company continues to take the long view.

""The way we look at the business is tied to some very basic fundamentals that haven't changed for decades, if not hundreds of years,"" he said, noting it took oil a century to replace coal as the world's dominant energy source.

Exxon has estimated it can earn a double-digit return in the Permian Basin even if oil falls to $35 a barrel.

BRACING FOR LOW PRICES

U.S. oil prices largely have traded just above $50 a barrel since last November, requiring higher output to generate the same profit as when prices were higher. Prices this quarter are about 18% lower than this time last year, according to U.S. government data.

U.S. oil prices are likely to remain below $55 a barrel for the next three years, said Scott Sheffield, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources (N: ), one of the largest oil producers in the Permian Basin. Lacklustre prices will result in a ""significant fallback in Permian growth"" and probably ""no growth for most,"" he said on a recent earnings call.

Part of the slowdown comes as the best drilling spots in some areas of the field are being ""exhausted at a very quick rate,"" Sheffield said.

The severity of the looming downturn is a matter of debate.

Flotek Industries Inc (N: ), a supplier of oilfield chemicals, has cut staff twice this year. CEO John Chisholm told Reuters that the industry is just “pumping the brakes” as it grapples with well-design issues.

Matt Sallee, a portfolio manager at energy investors Tortoise Capital, expects a longer industry decline.

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 overcame early losses to close higher on Tuesday as hopes of imminent interest rate cuts from major central banks buoyed sentiment, while JD Sports jumped to an all-time high on upbeat results.

The blue-chip index ( ) added 0.4%, with JD Sports (L: ) gaining 8.8% after its gym clothing and premium-branded fashion helped it post higher profit and offset UK retail sector gloom.

The FTSE 250 ( ) rose 0.3%, helped in part by a nearly 13% surge in Cairn Energy (L: ) as strong half-year results led to a production target upgrade.

In a sign of ongoing rotation, investors dumped defensive shares and bought stocks of sectors that have underperformed this year, helping an index of banks ( ) climb 2.4% for its best day since January.

Shares of Lloyds (L: ) and Barclays (L: ) rose 4.3% and 4.9%, respectively, while healthcare stocks GlaxoSmithKline (L: ) and AstraZeneca (L: ) shed more than 2% each.

UK markets also looked past disappointing data from China overnight that had added to fears of a global recession.

Speculation that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates this week and that the U.S. Federal Reserve will follow suit later this month in the face of slowing economic growth helped stoke some risk appetite.

""Seeing as the ECB are tipped to go down the path of an interest rate cut, stocks are likely to be buoyant between now and the announcement,"" CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.

Oil heavyweights Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) were the biggest boosts to the main index as they tracked a rise in crude prices on hopes that OPEC and other oil-producing countries may agree to extend output cuts to prop up prices.

Stock market conditions are uncertain. The US-China trade war blows hot and cold. Brexit is on the horizon. Environmental concerns are growing. And recent figures suggest the UK economy could be slowing down.

Where should we be putting our cash?

If you want complete safety, you can put your spare money in a Cash ISA. But this is pretty much guaranteed to make you poorer.

I prefer to accept some risk and invest my cash in the stock market, where much higher returns are available. Here are three of my suggestions for dividend shares to buy today.

We can’t manage without this Shares in oil and gas giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) have fallen by nearly 10% over the last year. The stock now offers a dividend yield of 6.6%, well above the average of 4.5%.

City forecasts suggest that this dividend payout should be comfortably covered by earnings and surplus cash this year. So why is Shell stock so cheap?

One reason is this year’s weaker oil price. Another reason is that some investors are avoiding the oil sector due to environmental concerns. They fear that this business could be heading for a long-term decline.

However, all the forecasts I’ve seen suggest that oil and gas will remain important for several decades.

Shell is taking steps to position its business for peak oil demand and a more sustainable future. With the shares trading on 11 times forecast earnings and that chunky 6.6% dividend yield, I think the shares offer good value.

Another essential service Motor insurers like Direct Line Insurance Group (LSE: DLG) are also out of favour with investors at the moment. The whole sector is struggling with rising repair costs for modern cars.

At the same time, tough competition means that insurers’ ability to increase their prices is limited. Another source of pressure is that government bond yields are extremely low, making it hard for insurers to generate low-risk returns on premium cash.

However, FTSE 100 firm Direct Line is one of the bigger players in this sector and has a track record of stable profitability and generous shareholder returns.

I reckon that this company is well positioned to weather the difficult market conditions.

Broker forecasts put the stock on a forward price/earnings ratio of 10, with a prospective dividend yield of 9.7%. Although I’m not sure the dividend is sustainable at this level, I think Direct Line remains a very attractive buy for income.

I’d bank on this For more than 150 years, HSBC Holdings (LSE: LON: ) has played a key role in global trade between China and Europe.

The group is going through a challenging period at the moment, thanks to political tensions and the growth of rival Asian banks. Ultra-low interest rates are also making it harder for banks to make money. But I’m confident HSBC will survive these challenges, as it has done before.

In the meantime, I believe that the shares offer a good buying opportunity for long-term investors. At about 600p, the HSBC share price is trading close to its tangible net asset value of 582p. The dividend yield has risen to 6.9%, which looks sustainable to me based on current trading.

HSBC is unlikely to be a rapid growth stock. But if you’re looking for a reliable income, I think it could be good choice.

The FTSE 100 is the UK’s best-known stock market index. Made up of the 100 largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, it includes names such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), BP (LON: ), HSBC Holdings (LON: ), and Unilever (LON: ). Here, I’ll explain how to invest in the index.

FTSE 100 ETFs Unfortunately, you can’t invest directly in the FTSE 100. However, one easy way to get exposure to the index is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF), or tracker fund as they are also called, that tracks it. This kind of fund is designed to replicate the performance of the index minus a very small annual fee. So, for example, if the FTSE 100 rises by 1%, the value of your tracker fund should also rise by around 1%. If the FTSE 100 falls by 1%, the value of your tracker fund will fall by approximately that much.

Today, there are a number of FTSE 100 tracker funds available to UK investors. Some of the most popular funds include:

ishares 100 UK Equity Index fund

HSBC fund

Legal & General UK 100 Index Trust

Vanguard FTSE 100 Index fund

Hargreaves

To invest in one of these, you’ll need an account with an online broker such asLansdown (LON: ), Interactive Investor, or AJ Bell.

All of these tracker funds offer very low annual fees (0.06% to 0.18% per year) meaning that they are a cost-effective way to get exposure to the index. However, you also have to pay trading commissions when you buy or sell ETFs, which are generally around £10-£12 per transaction.

Be aware that all of the ETFs listed above come with ‘accumulation’ and ‘income’ versions. The difference here is that an accumulation fund will reinvest all your dividends (profits that companies pay out to investors) while an income fund will pay you an income stream. You can find out more about this here.

Overall, if you’re looking for cost-effective, hassle-free exposure to the FTSE 100, a tracker fund could be a good option.

FTSE 100 stocks Another option that you may want to consider is investing in individual FTSE 100 stocks through an online broker.

Some investors prefer to buy individual stocks, instead of buying the whole index, because history suggests that not every company in the index will perform well in the future. As such, if you do your research and pick the right stocks, you could outperform the index. Picking your own stocks also provides you with more flexibility. For example, if you want to avoid tobacco stocks or defence companies for ethical reasons, you can do this. However, if you buy a tracker fund, you’ll automatically be exposed to these kinds of companies.

Investing in individual companies is more hassle, of course. It’s also likely to be more expensive than investing in a tracker fund because you’ll have to pay trading commissions on each stock you buy. This means that it’s not really a suitable approach for investors with a small amount of capital as it’s not economical. For example, if you want to buy 20 stocks to diversify your portfolio but you only have £2,000 to invest in total, trading commissions (20 x £10) will cost you around 10% of your money.

However, once you have built up some capital, investing directly in FTSE 100 companies is certainly an approach worth considering. With a solid investment strategy, you could potentially outperform the index.

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 fell on Monday as the pound ploughed ahead after unexpectedly robust economic data and as no-deal Brexit worries tempered, leaving internationally-focussed stocks in the dumps.

The blue-chip index ( ) lost 0.6%, shedding earlier gains and lagging its European peers, due to steep falls in pharmaceutical shares AstraZeneca (L: ), GlaxoSmithKline (L: ), and consumer goods giant Unilever (L: ).

The FTSE 250 index ( ) dipped 0.1%, though losses were limited thanks to a 10.4% surge in Intu Properties (L: ) after the Times reported that private equity firm Orion Capital Managers was looking to buy the shopping centre operator.

Sterling scaled a six-week high as fears of a recession were kept in check after data showed Britain's economy picked up more than expected in July despite Brexit uncertainty.

However, the local currency handed back some of those gains after news that John Bercow, Speaker in Britain's House of Commons, would be standing down from the role.

Over three years after Britain voted to leave the European Union, matters have only gotten more complicated as the process plays out.

In the latest twist, parliament passed a bill demanding that Prime Minister Boris Johnson delay Brexit unless he strikes a new deal, while his office insisted that Brexit would happen on Oct. 31, ""no ifs and buts"".

A NO DEAL OR A NEW REFERENDUM

""An unsettled UK political and economic landscape could be with us for some time,"" BlackRock (NYSE: ) analysts wrote in their weekly note.

""Six months ago, a negotiated deal looked most likely; now, the then-extreme outcomes – no-deal or a new referendum – look to have become more plausible.""

Helping contain losses on the main bourse were oil majors Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ), both of which eked out near 1% gains on hopes that Saudi Arabia's new energy minister will continue to support output cuts.

Elsewhere, Wall Street indexes gained on growing hopes that central banks will step in with stimulus plans after a data showed an unexpected fall in China's exports last month, while another one pointed to a slowdown in Japan's economy in the second quarter.

The weakness reflected an impact from the prolonged Sino-U.S. trade war to global economic growth.

The dispute saw a sharp escalation last month when the United States announced higher tariffs on Chinese goods. That had dragged the FTSE 100 to its biggest monthly fall so far this year that month.

On Monday, the index saw some news-related falls, with Associated British Foods (L: ) losing 2.1% after poor outlook for its Primark fashion chain and British Airways owner IAG (L: ) dropping 1.5% as it cancelled nearly all its flights due to strikes.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/oil-majors-stimulus-bets-support-ftse-100-1958087,0.106,0.82,0.074,-0.9495

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 overcame early losses to close higher on Tuesday as hopes of imminent interest rate cuts from major central banks buoyed sentiment, while JD Sports jumped to an all-time high on upbeat results.

The blue-chip index ( ) added 0.4%, with JD Sports (L: ) gaining 8.8% after its gym clothing and premium-branded fashion helped it post higher profit and offset UK retail sector gloom.

The FTSE 250 ( ) rose 0.3%, helped in part by a nearly 13% surge in Cairn Energy (L: ) as strong half-year results led to a production target upgrade.

In a sign of ongoing rotation, investors dumped defensive shares and bought stocks of sectors that have underperformed this year, helping an index of banks ( ) climb 2.4% for its best day since January.

Shares of Lloyds (L: ) and Barclays (L: ) rose 4.3% and 4.9%, respectively, while healthcare stocks GlaxoSmithKline (L: ) and AstraZeneca (L: ) shed more than 2% each.

UK markets also looked past disappointing data from China overnight that had added to fears of a global recession.

Speculation that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates this week and that the U.S. Federal Reserve will follow suit later this month in the face of slowing economic growth helped stoke some risk appetite.

""Seeing as the ECB are tipped to go down the path of an interest rate cut, stocks are likely to be buoyant between now and the announcement,"" CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.

Oil heavyweights Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) were the biggest boosts to the main index as they tracked a rise in crude prices on hopes that OPEC and other oil-producing countries may agree to extend output cuts to prop up prices.

Mid-cap builder Galliford Try (L: ) advanced 8% after it restarted preliminary talks to sell its residential housing businesses to Bovis Homes (L: ).

Bovis, whose shares dropped 3.5%, nudged up its proposed offer and included a cash element, which Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said would be ""a welcome injection for the newly reorganised Galliford construction division.""

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets got a new Internet giant on Wednesday, and the reception it got just underlined how few alternatives regional investors have when it comes to growth stocks.

The biggest company that absolutely nobody has ever heard of is called Prosus. It’s a holding company for the international Internet assets of South African investment firm Naspers.

More than anything, it’s a vehicle for Naspers’ 31% stake in Tencent Holding, the Chinese social media and gaming giant, whose value has mushroomed from $31 million back in 2001 to $130 billion today. But it also holds stakes in payments and food delivery companies, notably Delivery Hero and Takeaway.com, as well as other social media assets like Russia’s Mail.ru and online marketplaces such as OLX group.

Last year, it made a net profit of $4.25 billion, due largely to a $1.6 billion windfall gain on the sale of its stake in India’s Flipkart to Walmart (NYSE: ) Stores. Even after that disposal, the company is easily the largest consumer Internet company listed in Europe.

The company reckons its portfolio companies’ products and services are used regularly by around one-fifth of the world’s population. The listing “will give international tech investors the opportunity to directly invest in an attractive Internet portfolio,” Naspers said in a video on its website detailing the transaction.

Naspers issued shares worth around 25% in the new company to all its shareholders ahead of the listing. Euronext Amsterdam had given an indicative price of 58.70 euros a share, implying a market value of 95.3 billion euros ($105 billion).

However, Reuters reported the shares jumped to 76 euros on opening and only gave up a fraction of those gains in subsequent trading. That made it immediately the third-largest stock on the Amsterdam exchange by market value, behind Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Unilever (LON: ).

The listing came on a day when Europe’s markets were making broad advances on fresh hopes of détente on trade between China and the U.S. Earlier in the day, China had published a list of products to be exempted from its latest tariffs on imports from the U.S., which included cancer drugs and lubricant base oil but not the far more sensitive and economically important agricultural products such as soybeans and pork.

Opposition parties appear to have agreed to block an election taking place in October, which helped the pound hold its gains at a five-week high against the US dollar. The opened lower and continued sideways for the rest of the day. Trade tensions eased after the US and China agreed to hold high-level trade talks next month.

Oil impact Both Shell (LON: ) and BP’s shares fell this morning after think-tank Carbon Tracker stated that investment plans by Royal Dutch Shell, BP (LON: ) and ExxonMobil, among others, will not be compatible with the 2015 Paris Agreement. With concern for the planet at the heart of world negotiations, I don’t think this bodes well for these oil major’s share prices.

In other Shell news, it agreed to buy Norwegian oil and gas assets from Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) for up to $4bn.

Emerging markets Ashmore Group (LSE:ASHM), an emerging market fund manager, posted a 10% rise in its full-year core profit. This was slightly below forecast, but its shares rose 2% this morning. In the year to June, Ashmore grew its assets under management by 24% to $91.8bn due to increased inflows and positive market movements. The group manages money for institutional and retail clients in emerging markets, incorporating equity, debt, multi-asset and alternative funds.

The group has been wary about the effect the US-China trade war could have on the world economy but believes China is well placed to withstand the tariffs the US is imposing. Ashmore has exposure to Argentina, where the market is in turmoil, but finance director Tom Shippey said, “the political situation could create opportunities for active managers.” Ashmore is also interested in the possible Saudi Aramco IPO but would only get involved if the price was right.

I am encouraged by these results and Ashmore’s determined outlook, but I consider this a high-risk investment for beginners.

Berkeley Group Housebuilder Berkeley Group said it has been facing robust market conditions with stable pricing (during the first four months of its financial year) in London and the South East of England. This is surprising but encouraging given the ongoing chaos and worry caused by Brexit.

Greene King Greene King, brewer of Old Speckled Hen and Abbot Ale, continues to prepare for a proposed £4.6bn takeover by Hong Kong’s richest man Li Ka-Shing. Today the company stated comparable sales at its pubs rose 1.5% over the last seven weeks. Its share price gained 0.1%.

Dunelm Household goods retailer Dunelm Group (LSE:DNLM) posted its full-year results a few days ago and along with a 35% profit increase, announced a special dividend of 32p for October. The good news didn’t stop there. Earnings per share rose 38% to 50.2p as revenue jumped 5% to £1.1bn.

The company is still cautious about its full-year outlook due to Brexit worry and the impact on consumer spending. However, analysts continue to see this stock as a Buy and believe continued like-for-like growth is achievable.

Social media star and influencer Mrs Hinch is also thought to have contributed to the increase in Dunelm’s product sales as her housekeeping advice and product recommendations are avidly followed by fans. Brexit has created desperate times for High street retailers, so I find it heartening that Dunelm is producing such great results.

This afternoon the share price was up a further 4.9% as positive sentiment continued to reach shareholders.

(Bloomberg) -- A bloodbath in energy stocks is creating a rich opportunity for Big Oil to dominate America’s hottest shale play.

Independent producers in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico are trading much lower than when Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ) bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE: ). in April. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ) have expressed interest in bulking up in shale at the right price. Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ).’s chief said Wednesday his company is keeping a “watchful eye” on the Permian for potential deals.

Oil’s drop to near $55 a barrel, from $75 in October, is putting pressure on shale producers at a time when investors are losing faith in an industry that has burned about $200 billion of cash in a decade. Despite record U.S. output, the S&P index of independent exploration and production companies is trading near its troughs of 2008 and 2015, when crude prices sank south of $35 a barrel. The producers are now worth just 4.5 times their earnings before certain items, compared with 9 times about a year ago.

“It’s clear there are many E&Ps trading well below the Chevron valuation watermark from April,” said Michael Roomberg, who helps manage $4.4 billion at Miller/Howard Investments Inc. He expects “several additional deals over the next several quarters, and wouldn’t be surprised if the majors are involved.”

Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: ) Co. or Concho Resources (NYSE: ) Inc., which have both struggled this year, would be a good fit for Exxon, while Shell may look at smaller players like WPX Energy Inc. and Cimarex Energy Co (NYSE: )., according to Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.

The collapse in valuations has been so severe that the biggest shale producers may also come into play. EOG Resources Inc (NYSE: ). and Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE: ). could also be targeted, Ben Cook, a portfolio manager at BP (LON: ) Capital in Dallas, said earlier this year. Activist investor Carl Icahn is pushing for a shakeup of the board at Occidental.

After a slow start in shale, Exxon and Chevron have expanded in the Permian at prodigious rates over the past two years and now see onshore exploration in the U.S. as a key part of their global growth plans. They expect to more than double output to roughly 1 million barrels a day each by the early 2020s.

The two heavyweights are betting their ability to fund enormous drilling programs and build associated infrastructure like pipelines and gas terminals means they won’t encounter the growing pains the independents are currently experiencing.

“If there is the opportunity to acquire something that brings unique value to Exxon Mobil, we’ll be in a position to transact on that,” Exxon CEO Darren Woods said at a Barclays (LON: ) Plc conference Wednesday.

But he’s willing to let potential targets struggle for some time to get a better price.

“Time’s on our side to let that play itself out,” Woods said. “I think people need to recalibrate what they’re experiencing in that unconventional space, and that will have an impact on how people value companies.”

Chevron will be “opportunistic” in making acquisitions, the company’s North America head Jeff Gustavson said at the same conference. Any deal would have to be a strategic fit and be good value, he said.

BP Plc entered the fray a year ago, acquiring BHP Group Ltd.’s onshore oil and gas assets for $10.5 billion. In hindsight, the timing looks bad given the slump in shale valuations since then.

Waiting for too long could be risky as well. On the day Chevron bid for Anadarko (which it ended up losing to Occidental Petroleum Corp.), major shale producers surged as much as 12% as investors bet on a buyout frenzy.

So far, Exxon, Chevron and Shell are looking smart.

Some shale producers are struggling to pay creditors, with Sanchez Energy Corp. and Halcon Resources Corp. recently filing for bankruptcy protection.

The majors “are going to go out there and run these guys into bankruptcy,” Mark Rossano, CEO of C6 Capital Holdings, said on Bloomberg TV. “They’re going to look to pick up acreage at significant discounts.”",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/big-oil-circles-permian-riches-as-shale-stocks-collapse-1955819,0.052,0.847,0.101,0.9802

LONDON (Reuters) - Major oil companies have approved $50 billion (40.6 billion pounds) of projects since last year that will not be economically viable if governments implement the Paris Agreement on climate change, think-tank Carbon Tracker said in a report published on Friday.

The analysis found that investment plans by Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), BP (L: ) and ExxonMobil (N: ) among other companies will not be compatible with the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

""Every oil major is betting heavily against a 1.5 degree Celsius world and investing in projects that are contrary to the Paris goals,"" said report co-author Andrew Grant, a former natural resources analyst at Barclays (LON: ).

Big oil and gas companies have welcomed the U.N.-backed Paris Agreement, in which governments agreed to curb greenhouse gas emissions enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.

Scientists view 1.5 degrees Celsius as a tipping point where climate impacts such as sea-level rise, natural disasters, forced migration, failed harvests and deadly heatwaves will rapidly start to intensify if it is breached.

Carbon Tracker's analysis, co-authored by Mike Coffin, a former geologist at BP, found that 18 newly approved oil and gas projects worth $50 billion could be left ""deep out of the money"" in a lower carbon world.

The projects include Shell's $13 billion liquefied (LNG) Canada LNG project, a $4.3 billion oilfield expansion project in Azerbaijan owned by BP, Exxon, Chevron (N: ) and Equinor (OL: ), and a $1.3 billion deepwater project in Angola operated by BP, Exxon, Chevron, Total (PA: ) and Equinor.

The report also concluded that oil and gas companies risk ""wasting"" $2.2 trillion by 2030 on new projects if governments apply stricter curbs on greenhouse gas emissions.

Previous reports on the implications of climate change for oil and gas companies by Carbon Tracker and other researchers have contributed to a wave of investor pressure on majors to show that their investments are aligned with the Paris goals.

While some companies including Shell, BP, Total and Equinor have increased spending on renewable energy and introduced carbon reduction targets, the sector says it needs to continue investing in new projects to meet future demand for oil and gas as Asian economies expand.

Shell said in a statement that it has set out an ""ambition"" to halve net carbon emissions by 2050 ""in step with society as it moves towards meeting the aims of Paris.""

""As the energy system evolves, so is our business, to provide the mix of products that our customers need,"" Shell said.

BP said its strategy to produce low cost and low carbon oil and gas was in line with the International Energy Agency (IEA)forecasts and the Paris agreement.

""All of this is aimed at evolving BP from an oil and gas focused company to a much broader energy company so that we are best equipped to help the world get to net zero while meeting rising energy demand,"" the company said in a statement.

Exxon, Chevron, Equinor and Total did not reply to requests for comment.

Nevertheless, the latest Carbon Tracker report said the big oil and gas companies spent at least 30% of their investment last year on projects that are inconsistent with the path to limit global warming to even 1.6 degrees Celsius.

""These projects represent an imminent challenge for investors and companies looking to align with climate goals,"" the report warned.

Carbon Tracker's calculations were based on three scenarios produced by the Paris-based IEA models of oil and gas supply under different warming pathways.

With fossil fuel supply on course to outstrip demand if the world is to limit warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, the report assumed that the projects with the lowest production costs would be the most competitive.

""Demand for oil can be satisfied with projects that break even at below $40 per barrel and pursuing higher-cost projects risks creating stranded assets that will never deliver adequate returns,"" the report said.

By Florence Tan

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil major BP (L: ) plans to sell more to Asia as its shale oil production grows, seeking to capitalise on growth in the world's key demand region.

The strategy, outlined in a Reuters interview with company executives, follows BP's move to acquire giant miner BHP's (AX: ) assets in the United States' prolific Permian shale basin last year, expected to give its portfolio a boost in light-sweet crude production.

""This (Asia) is a key growth region"" for energy demand, said Sharon Weintraub, BP's chief executive officer of supply and trading for the eastern hemisphere. She didn't specify BP's growth targets for Asia sales.

""We recently bought BHP's assets in our U.S. business so we have a greater amount of Permian crude coming to market over the next few years in terms of our equity portfolio,"" Weintraub said.

Zoe Anderson, head of analytics at the supply and trading, eastern hemisphere business, said, ""The idea is, yes, we want to send (U.S. crude) supply here (Asia).""

BP has been actively shipping U.S. crude to Asia, having sold cargoes to Japan, Australia, Thailand and Vietnam as it jostles for business in the world's fastest-growing market with other giant producers and traders like Occidental (N: ), Trafigura, Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ), Chevron (N: ) and Aramco Trading Co.

BP ships a variety of light crudes to Asia, such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Midland and Eagle Ford, and medium-sour grades Mars and Thunder Horse.

More U.S. crude is being processed by refineries across Asia. It's replacing falling regional low-sulphur crude production, and some of the world's top crude oil importers, like South Korea and India, are expanding imports this year to replace sanctions-hit Iranian oil.

Sanctions on Venezuela, as well as Iran, have kept crude supplies in Asia snug, supporting Brent ( ) at $60 a barrel. But new supplies of refined products, liquefied (LNG) and petrochemicals have hit the market just as trade tensions between the United States and China dent demand, weighing on prices this year.

""With a lack of confidence affecting things like trade flows that's going to extend downside risks in the short run till we see some resolution, which is still unclear when that's going to happen,"" Weintraub said.

BP is also expecting new LNG supplies from Indonesia, Africa and the United States to come online in early next decade, Weintraub said, a period where some analysts expect the market to tighten.

These supplies include BP's share of production in the Greater Tortue development offshore Senegal and Mauritania, Venture Global's Calcasieu Pass project in the United States, and Indonesia's Tangguh phase 3 expansion.

""LNG is a cyclical market and it happens to be on the weaker side today, and we do expect demand to potentially right-size itself,"" Weintraub said.

Longer term, Asia also features in BP's plans to cope with a gradual global shift away from oil and into cleaner energy sources.

BP said last month it would build a network of electric-vehicle charging hubs in China with Didi Chuxing, the country's biggest ride-hailing company, in a bet on the world's largest market for such cars.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/bp-aims-to-sell-more-us-crude-to-asia-boost-lng-supplies-in-early-2020s-1957027,0.069,0.835,0.096,0.9124

(Bloomberg) -- Chevron Corp (NYSE: ). appears to be laying the groundwork to leave Venezuela in the event that the U.S. declines to extend a waiver allowing it to continue operating in the country.

Over the past year, the San Ramon, California-based company updated some of its contracts with partners in the South American country to allow for the possibility of early termination, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Under the new terms, Chevron would incur no penalties for early termination and all payments due would be prorated up to the date of notification.

The new provisions come as the U.S. continues tightening sanctions against Venezuela in a bid to oust President Nicolas Maduro. Chevron, the last American company producing oil in the country, faces the October 25 expiration of a special waiver allowing it do business there. Some of Chevron’s long-term contracts were updated at the end of 2018, while other agreements were modified after the company obtained the sanctions waiver in July.

A Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said the company is hopeful that its license to operate will be renewed in October. “Chevron is not preparing to leave Venezuela,” he said by email. “Our technical service agreements are reviewed and changed regularly for business circumstances and to be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”

If the U.S. government declines to extend Chevron’s waiver, the decision would put an end to the oil major’s 100-year history in the country, a story that started in the 1920s and survived a number of military coups and civil unrest. While Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: )., Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ) pulled out of Venezuela, Chevron reaffirmed its commitment to the country.

The company has applied its expertise in extracting heavy oil from California oil fields to its projects in South America and over the years has expanded its footprint by building a facility to pre-process sludgy Venezuelan oil into refinery-ready grades.

Chevron warned in August that developments in the crisis-torn South American nation could hurt its earnings.

“Future events related to the company’s activities in Venezuela may result in significant impacts on the company’s results of operation in future periods,” Chevron said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The language had evolved from the company’s previous quarterly filing, when it said developments in the country could lead to “increased business disruption and volatility in the associated financial results.”

Chevron has about 330 direct employees in Venezuela, according to a person familiar with the company affairs. Venezuela accounted for only 1% of the company’s global output in 2018, or 42,000 barrels daily. The Petroboscan and Petropiar ventures are currently active, while the Petroindependencia and Petroindependiente projects are shut amid lack of parts and a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela.

(Bloomberg) -- The first cargo of liquefied has set sail from a $15 billion Texas export terminal, amplifying America’s growing influence on the global market for the fuel.

LNG Jurojin departed Freeport LNG Development LP’s facility on Tuesday, according to a statement from the company, making the terminal the fifth to ship super-chilled gas from U.S. shale fields. Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc will take the first two deliveries from Freeport, according to a person familiar with the matter. The cargo is headed for the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, ship-tracking data on Bloomberg show.

Since the first U.S. LNG export terminal began operating in Louisiana in 2016, the nation has become the world’s third-largest supplier of the fuel, sending gas to buyers as distant as Japan. The startup of Freeport has provided a key outlet for Texas production, helping to boost gas prices from 1990s-era seasonal lows.

America may surpass Qatar and Australia to become the biggest exporter by 2025, according to Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ). But a global glut is threatening the derail the next wave of U.S. LNG projects, while trade tensions have thwarted developers’ efforts to sign long-term contracts with Chinese buyers.

Freeport is seeking to build four LNG production units, or trains, with a capacity of more than 20 million tons per year, most of which is contracted under 20-year supply agreements. Train 1 was previously slated to begin production in the fourth quarter of 2018, but was delayed amid contractor snags.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), one of the world's largest liquefied (LNG) suppliers, has asked U.S. regulators to extend the time by which it should complete an LNG export project in Louisiana by five years to 2025, regulatory filings showed.

The project, a 50-50 venture with U.S. midstream company Energy Transfer (N: ), envisaged converting an existing import and regasification facility in Lake Charles into a multi-train, 16.45 million tonnes per year (mtpa) facility.

The delay takes a major U.S. export project out of the race to achieve a final investment decision (FID) in time to start operations during an anticipated supply downturn in 2023-2024.

About a dozen projects in North America, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico, are vying for FID this year or early next year to start production in time to hit that sweetspot. But the more get approved, the less likely other projects are to go ahead as the expected dearth turns into oversupply.

The delay is due to Shell's takeover of the project after its $53 billion (£43 billion) acquisition of BG Group in 2016 prompted it to re-evaluate and strike new agreements, the Anglo-Dutch company said in a letter dated last Friday to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

It said following this process, the project plans had not changed but a new 50-50 ownership structure with Energy Transfer had been struck and Shell had committed to taking 50% of the export capacity.

""Under the new Project Framework Agreement, ET and Shell have established a detailed process for the development of the Project which includes milestones that are expected to result in the Project sponsors reaching FID as early as the end of 2020,"" it said in the letter.

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday rejected Exxon Mobil Corp's (N: ) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc's (L: ) effort to revive a $1.8 billion arbitration award against Nigeria's state-run oil company, which stemmed from a dispute over a 1993 contract to extract oil near the African country's coastline.

U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan cited public policy and due process considerations in deciding not to enforce the October 2011 award against Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC), which was subsequently set aside by courts in Nigeria.

""While this court may have inherent authority to fashion appropriate relief in certain circumstances, exercising that authority to create a $1.8 billion judgment is a bridge too far,"" Pauley wrote in a 50-page decision.

The companies said last November that the award had grown to $2.67 billion, including interest.

Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said the Irving, Texas-based company disagreed with the decision and was evaluating its next steps. Shell and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

""NNPC is very pleased with the decision, and was always confident that there was no basis for a U.S. court to confirm the award,"" its lawyer Cecilia Moss said in an interview.

According to court papers, the 1993 contract anticipated that Exxon and Shell affiliates would invest billions of dollars to extract oil from the Erha field, about 60 miles (97 km) off Nigeria's coast, and share profits with NNPC.

But the affiliates, Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Co Ltd, accused NNPC of unilaterally ""lifting"" more oil than was contractually allowed, at the behest of Nigeria's government, depriving them of billions of dollars of oil.

Pauley said Exxon and Shell still have ""multiple appeals pending"" in Nigeria, and rejected their argument that it might be difficult to collect there.

Exxon and Shell ""executed a contract in Nigeria with another Nigerian corporation containing an arbitration clause requiring any arbitration to be held in Nigeria under Nigerian law, and it then sought to confirm the award in Nigeria,"" Pauley wrote. ""[They] cannot now reasonably complain that [their] efforts to collect will be frustrated in Nigeria.""

In an Aug. 7 regulatory filing, Exxon said it did not expect the case to materially affect its operations or financial condition.

BP +0.75% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.51% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

Shares in UK Oil & Gas (LSE: UKOG) have fallen 52% over the past 12 months, and have lost a crushing 89% of their value since their September 2017 peak.

There’s been the occasional short-term upwards blip, but it never seems to last and the price just carries on with its downward slide. There was one of those blips in August, leading to a gain of 13%… an unusually good month for UKOG shareholders.

And as of Tuesday’s market close, September has made a good start with a further gain of 5.6%. But before I look closer, why have the shares performed so badly over the past couple of years?

Where’s the oil? It’s partly down to disappointment following early claims of huge quantities of oil beneath the firm’s Horse Hill prospect in West Sussex, at what had been optimistically dubbed the ‘Gatwick Gusher’. There was even talk of up to 100bn barrels of oil across the wider Weald Basin. So how much of this has so far made it to the surface?

According to the firm’s August progress update, it’s now pumped just 60,186 barrels from its test drilling. And we’ve still seen no sign of the long-awaited Competent Person’s Report to provide evidence of likely hydrocarbon reserves.

A big part of that fall is the dilution caused by the company’s frequent new share issues. UKOG has been raising new cash at regular intervals, using it to fund operations and acquisitions — some furthering its interest in Horse Hill, but also in unrelated areas.

Different this time? The latest share price recovery started with a spike on 9 August. There was no news that day, but it came shortly after the company’s announcement on 7 August it had bought out Tellurian Investments to take its Horse Hill interest from 50.6% to 85.6%. Perhaps it was just a delayed response to that.

We have since heard UKOG has had two of its licences extended by two years — one is its Isle of Wight PEDL331 Arreton licence, the other PEDL143 in the northern Weald — but the share price didn’t really budge in response.

On thing I do find interesting about the early August price rise is that it’s held up for almost a month now, where as previous price strengthening has typically fallen away again in days. So what’s happened?

I can’t help feeling the share price has simply found its natural level, for now at least, where there just aren’t enough disillusioned shareholders left to keep on selling and pushing it down further. UKOG shares may well remain around the current price until one of two things happens — either we get hard evidence of significant commercial hydrocarbon deposits, or the whole thing collapses.

Riches or bust? While we await more news, I still don’t see any answers to two key questions. With all of the new equity issues we’ve seen over the past couple of years, which significant investors are building up their holdings? I don’t see them.

And if the Weald is concealing such vast oily riches, how come UKOG has been able to buy up other companies’ interests so cheaply and why aren’t the big players like BP (LON: ) and Shell (LON: ) taking any interest?

I’m keeping well away.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Major offshore oil and gas producers on Friday were evacuating non-essential staff from production platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to the threat from Hurricane Dorian.

BP (LON: ), Chevron Corp (NYSE: ) and BHP Group said they had or were in the process of removing some workers from their facilities as a precautionary measure. Each said oil and gas production at the offshore facilities was unaffected.

Dorian is forecast to strike the Atlantic coast of Florida by early next week as a major hurricane. Some computer models project Dorian may cross the Florida peninsula and enter the Gulf of Mexico.

Oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico account for 16%of oil output and about 4% of U.S. .

Planned evacuations were complete at BP's Atlantis, Mad Dog, Na Kika and Thunderhorse, and at Chevron's Petronius and Blind Faith platforms, the companies said. BHP will evacuate non-essential workers from its Neptune and Shenzi production facilities on Saturday, a spokeswoman said.

Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ) and Occidental (NYSE: ) Petroleum said they are closely monitoring Dorian, and their Gulf of Mexico operations were operating normally.

Other oil companies with operations in the U.S.-regulated north Gulf of Mexico did not reply to requests for comment about offshore operations.

Chevron said its Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery continues to monitor the storm.

Shell (LON: ) Oil Co, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, has not modified operations at its Norco and Convent, Louisiana, refineries, according to spokesman Ray Fisher.

In the current low-interest-rate environment, Cash ISAs don’t have much appeal, in my view. According to MoneySavingExpert.com, the best Cash ISA interest rate on offer right now is just 1.44%, meaning that if you invested £10,000, you’d only pick up £144 in interest for the year. Not much to get excited about, is it? Once you factor in inflation – which has averaged just over 2% in the UK over the last three months – your money is actually losing value over time.

However, the good news is that there are plenty of other ways to generate a higher return on your money right now. One such strategy is investing in FTSE 100 dividend stocks. In this article, I’ll show how you could potentially generate a yield of 7% on your money by investing in dividend stocks.

7% from FTSE 100 dividend stocks Dividend stocks pay out a proportion of the company’s profits, in cash, to investors on a regular basis. The cash payouts are called ‘dividends’ and they’re generally paid twice, or four times, per year. The ‘dividend yield’ is a similar concept to the interest rate that a savings account offers.

Now, the UK’s is full of dividend stocks and many of them offer extremely attractive dividend yields right now. As a result, it’s quite easy for UK investors to put together a basic portfolio that pays a high level of income. Consider the following example:

Company Dividend yield Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) B 6.6% Lloyds Banking Group (LON: ) 6.9% Legal & General Group (LON: ) 8.0% Imperial Brands (LON: ) 9.6% GlaxoSmithKline 4.6% Average dividend yield 7.1%

This simple five-stock portfolio, which includes some of the most well-known companies in the UK such as Royal Dutch Shell, Lloyds Bank, and Legal & General, offers an average dividend yield of an incredible 7.1% – nearly five times the interest rates offered on the top Cash ISAs. That means that a £10,000 portfolio, split across the five stocks above, could potentially generate income of £710 per year – far more income than the interest you would receive if you put £10K in a Cash ISA.

Of course, this is just a simple example of a dividend portfolio. In reality, you’d want to own more than five stocks in order to lower your risk. But the message is clear – dividend stocks can deliver high income.

Risk versus reward Now, before investing in stocks, it’s important to be aware of the risks. The main thing to understand is that stocks are a long-term investment. While the stock market tends to rise over the long term, in the short term, share prices can fluctuate, meaning you might not get back what you invested if you need access to your money in the near future. Secondly, unlike bank interest, dividends are not guaranteed. If the company’s profits fall, the dividend payout may be reduced. Overall, however, I see the risk/reward proposition as attractive. When you consider that you could pick up 7% from dividend stocks, versus just 1.4% from a Cash ISA, the choice is a no-brainer, in my opinion.

The may have slipped lately, but it remains a great place to invest for your long-term wealth. Building a balanced mix of top UK blue-chip stocks and reinvesting your dividend income for growth, year after year, can put you on the road to building a £1m portfolio.

You won’t get there by leaving money in a Cash ISA where you’ll be lucky to get interest of more than 1-2% a year. The gold price may be rising at the moment but it doesn’t pay any income at all.

I would prefer to buy the following two stocks, which offer hugely generous income streams ranging from 6% to nearly 9%, and are available at bargain valuations.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Despite the push towards renewable energy, oil still drives the global economy. I’m as worried about climate change as anybody, but I don’t see its influence changing for years.

Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell (LSE: RDSB) pays one of the most reliable dividends of all, as its payout famously hasn’t been cut since the Second World War. It’s a proud record the FTSE 100 major is keen to maintain, which gives you a degree of security even if the oil price continues to fall from today’s $60-or-so for a barrel of .

The Shell share price performance has disappointed lately, down 12% in the last year, but this has the benefit of driving up the value of the dividend. The stock currently offers a forecast yield of 6.3%, covered 1.3 times by earnings. That’s three or four times the interest rate on a Cash ISA.

Its falling share price brings another benefit for far-sighted investors. It leaves Shell trading at a dirt-cheap valuation, now just 11.6 times forward earnings, compared to the index average of 17.33 times.

Shell isn’t just an oil company, it’s also pumping money into gas, chemicals, bio-fuels and low-carbon electricity, as part of the wider energy transition. Doubtless, there’ll be bumps along the way, but if the dividends keep rolling in, who cares?

Aviva (LON: ) Insurance giant Aviva (LSE: AV) is another FTSE 100 stalwart I would buy today and pop into a portfolio with the aim of making £1m over the longer run.

Just like Shell, and many companies right now, recent share price performance has been disappointing – Aviva’s is down 27% over the last year. Yet once again, this benefits investors who like picking up bargain stocks at discounted valuations.

It’s even cheaper than Shell, trading at just 6.2 times forward earnings. That’s a real bargain basement price. The dividend is even more astonishing, as it offers a forecast income of 8.7%, covered a healthy 1.9 times by earnings.

Now there is a danger that management could cut the payout, which is starting to look too generous, but we can still expect the stock to offer a healthy income for years to come.

Too many investors focus on share price growth when buying stocks for their portfolio. Yet, in a world of near zero interest rates, dividend income heroes are the main attraction.

The share price of oil behemoth Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) has slumped 12% since late July. Over the same period, oil equipment firm Hunting (LSE: HTG) has seen its shares fall over 20% (even with a 3.5% rise today on the back of its half-year results release). I think both companies have the potential to deliver strong returns for investors buying at today’s prices.

Hunting a bargain Hunting today reported a 15% increase in first-half revenue to $509m, despite “the general market uncertainty within the oil and gas industry.” It saw growth in most of its bigger geographies, and product and service segments, with the exception of its large Hunting Titan business, where “challenging US onshore markets” adversely impacted revenue and margins.

Group pre-tax profit increased 4% to $54.6m, but a higher tax charge saw the bottom-line slip lower, feeding into a 6% dip in earnings per share (EPS) to 24.6 cents. The company has maintained a strong balance sheet — net cash of $33.4m at the period end — and the board confidently increased the interim dividend 25% to 5 cents.

For the full year, I’m looking for EPS of around 50 cents (41p at current exchange rates), and a dividend of maybe 12 cents (9.8p). With the shares at 445p, as I’m writing, this would give a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.9 and prospective dividend yield of 2.2%.

I rate the stock a ‘buy’ at this valuation, because I’m expecting a strong earnings performance next year, with management continuing to deliver on its strategy of “focused growth based on proprietary technology and ongoing lean manufacturing initiatives.” For example, a recent $12.5m bolt-on acquisition has added a strong product suite to the group’s offshore technology portfolio and gives it access to leading global deep-water projects.

Evolving Shell Shell is another stock where we can expect a subdued earnings performance this year, followed by strong EPS growth next year. This will be helped by continuing share buybacks. Indeed analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch reckon the company will crank up buybacks towards $12bn a year in the coming years, with potentially 30% of its shares repurchased by 2025.

As my colleague Roland Head commented in his review of the oil giant’s half-year results earlier this month: “Shell’s management is actively taking steps to position the company for a future when oil consumption is lower.” Share buybacks are part of this, protecting shareholder value, as management shrinks the business with lower investment in new oil assets.

At the same time, it’s developing its liquid , chemicals and marketing businesses, as well as new energies like biofuels and low-carbon electricity. In my opinion, it’s well positioned to evolve in the coming decades, as well as attractively valued on current earnings forecasts.

At a share price of 2,300p, City consensus expectations put the stock on a P/E of 11.7, with a prospective 6.7% dividend yield. Income seekers will love the yield, but with forecast EPS growth of 25% next year, there’s a growth story here too. The price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio for 2020 is 0.4, suggesting plenty of scope for the shares to re-rate higher. As such, I’d be happy to buy a slice of the business today.

If you have money to save this payday, that’s great news. However, before you go and dump it in a Cash ISA, ask yourself whether that’s the best move financially. Given that the best related interest rate is around 1.5%, if you’re saving for a long-term goal, you may be better off ditching the Cash ISA and investing that money elsewhere.

Better options Two alternative accounts you could consider are the Stocks & Shares ISA and the Lifetime ISA. These investment vehicles are far more powerful than the Cash ISA because they enable you to hold a wide variety of wealth-boosting investments, and not just cash savings. Like the Cash ISA, they’re tax-efficient – all capital gains and income generated within them are completely tax-free.

If you’re looking for flexibility in terms of accessing your money, a Stocks & Shares ISA is probably your best bet, as this account allows you to access your money at any time. You can put up to £20,000 per year into this ISA.

With the Lifetime ISA, your money is locked away until you turn 60, or you buy your first house. However, this ISA – which is only open to those aged 18-39 and has an annual allowance of £4,000 – does come with 25% bonuses from the government, which is a huge attraction. As an example, if you were to put in £1,000, the government will add in another £250 for you.

Get your money working for you As to where to invest the money once you have opened one of these accounts, there are many options. One solid option, in my view, is dividend-paying companies. These pay out a certain proportion of their profits, in cash, to shareholders on a regular basis.

Popular dividend stocks include the likes of Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), Lloyds Bank, and Legal & General. Right now, all three of these stocks offer dividend yields above 6.5%, although bear in mind that dividends are not guaranteed.

If you don’t want to pick stocks yourself, you could consider investing in a tracker fund. This will give you exposure to the 100 largest companies listed in the UK through just one security. These funds generally offer dividend yields of around 4.5% right now.

Alternatively, if you’re looking for a little more growth, you could consider investing in a global equity fund that invests in top companies listed all across the world. While past performance is no guarantee of future performance, many of these funds have performed very well in recent years due to the strong growth of the world’s largest tech companies. For example, the Fundsmith Equity fund, which I’m a huge fan of, has delivered a return of 173% in just five years.

Ultimately, the choice is yours. Just make sure you get your money working for you. If it’s earning 1.5% or less in a Cash ISA, you’re not going to get ahead.

901,261,SHEL,2019-08-30,Is the BP share price a buy after £4.5bn Alaska oil sell-off? By The Motley Fool,"Published Aug 30, 2019 09:40 Updated Aug 30, 2019 10:06

The BP (LSE:LON: ) share price is trending up after it agreed to sell its entire Alaska oil operation, but is the energy giant a buy for value investors?

The £4.5bn sale ends 60 years of exploration in the lucrative Alaskan oil fields for BP with much more coming into the coffers as BP plans to divest £10bn in current assets over the next two years.

Looking forward On the face of it the BP share price is a promising buy with a headline dividend yield of 6.2% on a trailing P/E ratio of just 12.

Solid dividends of 10.25 cents per share every quarter have been matched by annual payouts in the region of 40 cents per share. The fact that BP, like Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), reports earnings in US dollars, means that it too is less susceptible to volatility in the pound.

BP’s top brass have said that they will follow the likes of Shell in transitioning away from an oil-led business to focus on a lower carbon future.

Shell’s cast iron 6% dividend over the last decade makes it an attractive buy, especially since the shares are trading in the range of their 52-week low and management pushes for a move away from heavily polluting fossil fuels to grow sustainable sources.

BP may go down in history as the architect of the 2010 Deepwater oil spill crisis. And the disaster still weighs on BP’s balance sheet to the tune of $1.4bn a quarter.

But chief executive Bob Dudley has made it clear that more attention will be paid to the booming renewables market. BP is targeting 3.5m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2025 and its own research shows renewables could make up 15% of the global energy market by 2040. Commenting on the Alaska sale, Dudley said: “We have other opportunities that are more closely aligned with our long-term strategy“.

Weak oil prices have hurt BP’s profit margins over the last six months and its share price too, which is down 10% for the year. To me that represents a good buy-in opportunity for value investors.

Too much debt? One thing to watch for with the BP share price — along with other big dividend payers on the — is how net gearing impacts on profitability.

Debt repayments can put downward pressure on dividends and when the accounting bods start to look for places to trim the fat, planned payouts to shareholders may be first on the chopping block.

Net debt grew slightly to $46.5bn in 2019 half-year results, compared with $38.7bn a year ago. Net gearing also crept higher to 31% from 30.4% in first-quarter results, and 27.8% 12 months ago, but City analysts suggests these levels have peaked.

CFO Brian Gilvary noted how a new accounting standard called IFRS 16, which adds previously unmentioned leased assets to company balance sheets, had come in for the first time this year, while adding that the company continued to target gearing in the 20% to 30% range.

These kinds of numbers are not unusual for the sector and brokers are also eyeing a potential dividend increase in the third or fourth quarter.

I’d rate BP a solid buy on the basis of its dividends and good leadership, with plenty of upside left for the share price to grow.

There’s a common image of stock market investors sitting in front of screens all day, waiting on every snippet of information, and making snap decisions on whether to buy, sell or hold whenever a stock comes up on their newsfeed.

If you’ve read any of our thoughts here at The Motley Fool, you’ll know we’re nothing at all like that — and nor should you be. But the question of whether, and when, to buy shares is still an important one.

Banks You might, for example, have looked at the carnage that hit the banking sector immediately after the UK’s Brexit referendum in June 2016, and seen the expectation that our exit from the EU would put an end to the UK’s prominent position in the European banking business. But shares are often oversold in the immediate aftermath of a surprise and then rebound to a more sensible valuation when the shock subsides.

If you’d acted on that thought and bought banking shares, you might have been feeling pleased around 12 to 18 months later after they started on what looked like a decent recovery. But progress towards Brexit since then has sent banking shares diving once more. Apart from HSBC, which is heavily focused on the Far East, the sector is down at around those post-referendum levels again — Lloyds, Barclays (LON: ), RBS (LON: ), they’ve all gone nowhere.

Oil What about the oil crisis? If you’d decided, back in January 2016, that oil prices of around $30 per barrel were unsustainably low, and you’d taken that as a sign to invest in big UK oil stocks, you’d have done very nicely. BP (LON: ) shares are up 66% since then, and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) has done even better with an 88% rise.

In one case, investing in a major sector when it looked oversold would have been a good move, and in another case it wouldn’t. But how do you tell?

The answer is you can’t — and you’re very unlikely to do well as an investor if you try to time the market anyway. Very few people can do it successfully, and even fewer consistently. Possibly the world’s best ever investor, Warren Buffett, simply doesn’t try — he follows the maxim that it’s time in the market, not timing the market, that counts.

What now? So where does that leave us? Should we buy shares now, or wait until Brexit is finished? Will there be a recession? Will a no-deal Brexit cause shares to slump? Or will a further depressed pound cause shares to rise in sterling terms?

We simply don’t know, and we shouldn’t really care. All we can do is look at a company now, and ask a few things. Is it a great company? Is it at an attractive price now? Is it a company you’d be happy to hold for the next 10 years?

Right now, I think there are plenty of shares in the and that easily satisfy those requirements, especially with the FTSE 100 on a very attractive forecast dividend yield of 4.5%. What do I think will happen to share prices over the next few months? Don’t know, don’t care — I’m buying shares today to hold for the next decade.

LONDON (Reuters) - North Sea oil and gas producer Siccar Point is wooing potential buyers of its assets with just under 600 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of discovered resources and a $2 billion tax incentive in Britain, a sale document showed.

Siccar Point, headed by a former Centrica (L: ) executive and backed by private equity firm Blue Water Energy and Blackstone (N: ), sees its output reaching about 80,000 boe per day (boed) by about 2027, the sale document showed.

Consultancy WoodMackenzie has valued the portfolio at about $2 billion, but an industry source said that was too high.

Siccar Point closed the acquisition of OMV's (VI: ) British North Sea portfolio for $870 million in 2017.

The deal included a further $125 million once a final investment decision on Rosebank field is reached. Since then, Siccar point has invested more in its portfolio of assets.

Siccar Point now produces just over 10,000 boed. Beyond this, output will mainly be boosted by the Cambo development.

Among other smaller stakes, Siccar Point holds 70% in Cambo field alongside Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), 11.8% in BP-operated (L: ) Shiehallion field and 20% and 9%, respectively, in Equinor-operated (OL: ) Rosebank and Mariner fields.

The portfolio offers production and exploration opportunities in the West of Shetlands area, where majors like BP , Shell and Equinor are boosting North Sea production.

Overall, however, the North Sea has seen majors exit and smaller private-equity backed players enter over recent years.

Siccar Point would offer a potential buyer $2 billion in so-called tax losses in Britain, which would ""shelter profits with no tax payments expected until (the) late 2020s,"" according to the sale document sent to potential buyers.

Such incentives offered by the government are common among North Sea producers, which suffered losses after the last oil price crash that saw the Brent crude benchmark ( ) slump to below $30 a barrel in 2016. They can make aging fields more attractive to investors.

Reuters reported in July that Siccar Point was looking for buyers for its assets.

Investment bank Rothschild and Lambert Energy Advisory are running the sale process for Siccar Point, according to the document and sources.

For any sensible portfolio, dividends should be a consideration. Even if focusing on growth, having some stocks with decent yields, particularly if reinvested, can help a portfolio move in the right direction through the lean years as well as the good.

Personally I look to the and for my dividend shares, wanting stable blue-chips as a foundation that supports any riskier investments. Here are three stocks I have for just this reason.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) The oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LSE: RDSB) has been a cornerstone of my portfolio for years. As it currently stands, the firm offers a dividend yield of about 6.5% — a very nice figure that comes about through some edging off in the share price rather than the company over-extending itself.

Shell has some of the most consistent dividends in the FTSE 100, including extraordinary dividends when there is cash to spare, and has seen its payouts increase almost 6% year-on-year for the past five years. It’s a stable blue-chip that, while subject to crude price fluctuations like all oil firms, has diversified and shown an ability to make sensible decisions when necessary.

Meanwhile the company has committed to a number of share buybacks and dividend increases for at least the next two years, and looking at the its financials, I agree with my fellow Fool G A Chester, there is potential for growth here as well as income.

BAE Systems (LON: ) The UK giant BAE Systems (LSE: BA) offers another stable base to any portfolio. A defensive stock both by industry and in its nature as an investment, the company currently offers a dividend yield of about 4% — the lower end of what I would look for as an income stock, but solid nevertheless.

Another consistent performer in terms of dividend payouts, BAE has been able to increase dividends by about 2% year-on-year. Even with some recent gains in the share price, the stock comes in with a forward-looking P/E of about 12, making it pretty cheap for a company so well established.

HSBC Holdings (LON: ) The final company I think of as a long-term solid performer, is the London-based, Asia-focused HSBC Holdings (LSE: HSBA). Having seen its price edge lower this month, the current yield stands at a very nice 6.7% — one of the highest on the FTSE 100.

HSBC has increased these dividends by an average 6% per annum for the past five years, and while banking and financial stocks are sometimes towards the more volatile end of what I consider blue-chips, HSBC has a solid brand and the finances to back it up.

As with many UK stocks at the moment, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit is a worry, but I think HSBC will be in a strong position in the long run, no matter what the outcome. Royal Dutch Shell and BAE Systems meanwhile, are also well placed to weather economic storms – exactly what I want as the backbone of a portfolio.

By Ron Bousso

LONDON (Reuters) - When Royal Dutch Shell wanted to buy a stake last year in a promising exploration block off South Africa, Total , the asset's main shareholder, used its right to stymie the deal and acquired the share itself, only to sell it on to Qatar Petroleum.

The rapid turn of events caught some of those involved by surprise, according to company sources close to the transaction, whose details have not previously been reported.

For Total (PA: ), it was part of a wider quest to tighten ties with Qatar Petroleum (QP) in an effort to secure a stake in the Gulf country's planned expansion of its liquefied (LNG) facilities, already the world's largest and one of the most lucrative projects in the energy sector.

The race for a role in the project has drawn in several of the world's largest energy companies, including Exxon Mobil (N: ) and Shell (L: ), which have also offered QP stakes in some of their most prized ventures.

Energy companies see natural gas, the least polluting hydrocarbon, as a key fuel in the transition to a lower-carbon economy. Liquefying the gas allows its transportation to consumer countries such as India, China and Japan and demand for LNG is expected to soar in coming decades.

Qatar's LNG production facilities, in which Total already holds a stake along with Shell, Exxon and ConocoPhillips (N: ), offer investors access to vast resources at among the cheapest production costs.

""That's a big, chunky piece of gas reserves. If you can buy into or somehow get involved in these projects, that might help (companies) on the reserves side,"" said Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at LNG shipbroker and consultancy Poten & Partners.

QP wants to expand its LNG production to around 110 million tonnes per annum from today's 77 mtpa over the next five years by building four new production facilities, known as trains.

The company is expected to announce its partners in the coming months, industry sources said.

The terms for the new production have not yet been revealed. They are likely to be less attractive than those for the original LNG facilities, but still among the most competitive in the world, Feer said.

""The returns on the expansion will be less merely because the risk from the earlier trains is largely gone ... There's no reason for the Qataris to give a better deal.""

QP's overseas investments are part of a strategy under Chief Executive Saad Al Kaabi, who is also Qatar's energy minister, to expand its global operations.

Kaabi has made no secret of his intentions.

""We are looking for a lot of things (in our partners) including asset swaps, things that will help me in my international expansion,"" Kaabi told Reuters in 2018.

""If I don't get good deals, nobody will come.""

The overseas investments and cooperation with foreign companies have also helped Qatar defy an embargo imposed by a number of neighbouring countries led by Saudi Arabia in 2017 over allegations that Doha supports terrorism. Qatar denies the charges.

COURTING QP

Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil major and the largest investor in Qatar LNG, has bolstered its global network with QP in recent months with a number of high-profile joint ventures.

Those include a $10 billion joint investment in the Golden Pass LNG project on the U.S. Gulf Coast and a stake in Exxon's gas development off Mozambique, which is set to be one of the world's largest LNG projects in the next decade. Both firms also acquired exploration blocks off Brazil, Argentina and Cyprus.

Shell, the largest foreign investor in Qatar, has recently applied to join the board of the U.S.-Qatari Business Council, industry sources said.

In 2014, Shell sold a 23% interest in a large project offshore Brazil to Qatar Petroleum International, then the country's foreign investment fund. The two companies also jointly won exploration rights in Mexico last year.

Rivals that are not part of the existing LNG production, including Chevron (N: ) and Italy's Eni (MI: ), also hope to win a foothold in the expansion.

Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi has visited Doha several times this year, company sources said, and Eni sold to QP stakes in a number of projects in Mozambique, Mexico, Morocco and Kenya.

Chevron last month teamed up with QP to build an $8 billion petrochemicals complex in Qatar.

A key requirement for QP is that partner companies remain heavily invested in any joint project, according to an executive at one oil major who spoke on condition of anonymity.

""Kaabi made it very clear that they can do the expansion on their own, so what the IOCs (international oil companies) can bring in is the international aspect. QP are leveraging the expansion to achieve their international aspirations,"" he said.

International investments have become ""an arm of foreign policy"" for Qatar, the executive said.

SOUTH AFRICA

Existing shareholders often have the right of first refusal for stakes being sold by another partner in oil and gas fields.

But Total's blocking the sale of Canadian Natural Resources' (TO: ) 25% stake in the 11B/12B block to Shell was particularly telling since the French firm's Anglo-Dutch rival is the world's largest LNG trader and a big competitor in Qatar.

In February this year, Total announced it had made a major gas discovery in the Brulpadda well within block 11B/12B, paving the way towards developing South Africa's first offshore field.

Shell and Canadian Natural Resources declined to comment.

Since the sale of the stake in South Africa to QP, Total has signed several other joint investment deals with the Doha-based company.

In Guyana, where vast resources have been discovered in recent years, Total sold to QP 40% of its 25% stake in the Orinduik block in July. Within days, the field's partners announced a huge discovery and plans to develop a production facility there.

On Tuesday, Total also announced a deal to transfer to QP rights in several blocks in Namibia.

""We have an 80-year-long presence in Qatar and we believe this long-term relationship has been fruitful for both Qatar Petroleum and Total,"" Total said in a statement to Reuters.

""Qatar Petroleum has been very active and successful in recent years to develop its international presence. We were already partners in Congo and we have extended this partnership in South Africa, Kenya, Namibia and Guyana,"" it said.

""This has been a very successful cooperation and we are glad that Qatar Petroleum made its first international discovery with us, on the Brulpadda prospect in South Africa earlier this year.""

Earlier this year, Total sold a stake in a development in Kenya to QP.

The French company's chief financial officer, Patrick de La Chevardiere, showed how high the stakes are when saying last October that the company would be ""disappointed if we are not part of Qatar's LNG expansion"".",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/exclusive-oil-giants-shower-qatar-with-crown-jewels-in-race-for-lng-prize-1951773,0.041,0.867,0.091,0.9949

The recent market sell-off made headlines. But it’s worth keeping this in perspective. Despite the recent volatility, the is actually up by about 6% so far this year.

When you add in the FTSE’s current dividend yield of 4.6%, index-tracking investors look set to enjoy a 10%+ return this year.

Of course, the market may go up or down this autumn. My approach is to ignore this short-term noise and focus on buying good quality dividend stocks at reasonable prices.

Today, I’m going to look at three FTSE stocks I own with dividend yields of more than 5%.

This £183bn firm looks cheap to me Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) needs no introduction. The oil and gas supermajor is the biggest company on the FTSE 100. It’s responsible for a fair chunk of the index’s 4.6% dividend yield.

However, if you buy the stock direct, you should get to enjoy a 6.6% dividend yield this year. Dividends are never guaranteed, but Shell’s payout hasn’t been cut since World War II. I wouldn’t worry about a cut.

Two things investors are worried about are the falling price of oil and the environmental risks of burning oil. Shell is slowly pivoting towards gas to try to address these risks and secure its long-term future.

Rightly or wrongly, I think the world will be burning a lot of oil-based fuels for many years to come. In my view, the risks are reflected in the Shell share price. Trading on 11 times earnings with that chunky 6.6% yield, I rate the shares as an income buy.

A friend in need We don’t know how good our car insurance companies are until we need to make a claim. But one company that’s been around a while and developed a strong brand is Direct Line Insurance Group (LSE: DLG).

I like the group’s solid profitability and good cash generation. However, this sector is out of favour with investors at the moment, as profits are under pressure from rising claims costs. Tough competition means that putting up prices is difficult.

The Direct Line share price has fallen by 12% over the last year, pushing the stock’s ordinary dividend yield to 7.3%. Analysts’ forecasts suggest an optional special dividend will be paid too, lifting the total yield to 9.5%.

I’m not sure about this, but I see the firm as a long-term survivor. In my view, the shares offer good value for long-term income investors at current levels. I may buy more for my portfolio.

New growth opportunity? Cardboard packaging isn’t glamorous. But it is essential. The business is growing too. Bosses at DS Smith (LSE: SMDS) recently reported “double-digit growth” in sales of e-commerce packaging.

The firm also believes that new cardboard products could soon replace a lot of the plastic packaging found in supermarkets, as retailers try to reduce non-recyclable waste. Company bosses reckon that 1.5m tonnes of plastic in supermarkets could readily be replaced by Smith’s cardboard products.

One risk for shareholders is that an economic slowdown could dent demand for packaging materials, as shoppers buy less.

So far, there doesn’t seem to be any evidence of this. And with the shares trading on just 9 times forecast earnings, I think the DS Smith share price already reflects a cautious outlook. I’ve added this 5.3% yield to my portfolio and remain a long-term buyer.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A global alliance of plastic makers and consumer goods companies said on Tuesday it would prioritize much of its $1 billion (£814 million) funds to curb plastic waste in Southeast Asia.

The Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW), consisting of 40 companies based around the world, committed $1 billion to an anti-plastic waste fund when it was launched earlier this year, pledging to invest half a billion more in within the next five years.

The group, now headquartered in Singapore, said the money would finance city partnerships and infrastructure to support waste management in Southeast Asian countries, which are among the world's worst ocean polluters.

""We recognise that Southeast Asia is an area where we want to put significant attention,"" Jim Seward, a vice president of chemicals maker LyondellBasell (N: ), one of the group's members, said a media event.

""We want to demonstrate working with our partners and stakeholders across the region through investment, that the problem is solvable.""

The AEPW's members include chemicals and plastic firms (N: ), Chevron (NYSE: ) Phillips Chemical Co , ExxonMobil (N: ), Shell (L: ), and consumer goods heavyweight Procter & Gamble (N: ), among others.

Four Southeast Asian countries, namely Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand, along with China, account for 60% of plastic waste in the oceans, according to a 2015 report co-authored by environmental campaigner Ocean Conservancy.

In June, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations acknowledged plastic waste as a major problem for the region and adopted a joint declaration to combat marine debris.

A number of whales and sea turtles have washed up dead on Southeast Asian coasts in recent years with plastic waste in their stomachs.

Most recently, an orphaned baby dugong in Thailand named Marium died because of plastic this month after being rescued in April.

A picture of the dugong, shared by actor Leonardo DiCaprio on his Instagram account on Saturday, has drawn more than 1.7 million likes.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/chemicals-plastic-makers-to-focus-on-curbing-southeast-asia-plastic-waste-1950068,0.108,0.833,0.059,-0.9734

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch government will end production at the vast Groningen field sooner than previously announced, Dutch Economy Minister Eric Wiebes said on Tuesday.

""I expect the Groningen field to no longer be necessary very soon"", Wiebes said in an interview on Dutch public radio.

""Things are moving very fast, a lot faster than anyone would have predicted some time ago.""

Output at Europe's largest onshore gas field, operated by Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L: ) and Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ), has been slashed in recent years as tremors blamed on drilling have damaged buildings and sparked unrest in the region.

Following a 3.4 magnitude earthquake, the government vowed last year to halt output at Groningen by 2030 and lower production as quickly as possible in the coming years.

Wiebes indicated on Tuesday the end of extraction would come a lot sooner than by the end of the next decade and said he would inform parliament soon on the exact date.

""We used to think that production would go on forever, then I said it would end by 2030, and I will soon say when it will end exactly"", the minister said.

The Dutch government said in June that output at Groningen looked set to drop 20% more than previously announced, to 12.8 billion cubic metres (bcm) in the year starting October 2019.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/dutch-to-end-groningen-gas-production-quicker-than-predicted--minister-1950729,0.058,0.942,0.0,-0.9081

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's planned privatisation of eight Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA: ) refineries has lured several of the world's largest trading and oil companies as prospective bidders, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.

Around 20 companies have signed non-disclosure agreements granting them access to the refineries' data and signalling that they are considering a bid, the sources added, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose private details of the sale.

The first round of non-binding offers for four of the eight refineries Petrobras put on the block is due on Oct. 11, the sources said. The eight refineries have total capacity of 1.1 million barrels per day.

Among the potential bidders are trading firms Vitol SA, Glencore PLC (L: ) and Trafigura AG. Local companies Ultrapar Participações SA (SA: ) and Raizen, a joint venture of Brazil's Cosan SA (SA: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), also signed non-disclosure agreements.

Other companies interested, according to the sources, include PetroChina Co (SS: ) and Sinopec (SS: ), which already has a Brazilian joint venture with Spain's Repsol (MC: ). Oil behemoth Saudi Aramco, which is planning one of the world's largest initial public offerings, is also looking at the refining units' numbers.

The request to access the data room is just the first step of companies interested in the deal, and does not mean they will deliver bids on Oct. 11.

Petrobras, PetroChina, Ultrapar, Sinopec and Vitol did not immediately comment on the matter. Raizen, Trafigura, Saudi Aramco and Glencore declined to comment.

TRANSFORMATIVE DEALS

The deal, to be one of Petrobras' largest divestitures ever, would transform Brazil's oil industry and may raise around $18 billion, bankers working on the deal say. Refining has traditionally been state-owned in Brazil, triggering occasional calls for government price controls.

At least partial privatisation is widely seen as one of the best possible ways to bring real competition to the Brazilian oil industry.

Antitrust watchdog CADE has already forced Petrobras to change its refinery sale process to boost competition, demanding the separate sale of each of the eight refineries. A single buyer will be barred from buying two of the largest refineries in the same area, whether it be the northeast, the south or the southeast.

Petrobras is also carving out logistics assets, such as oil pipelines and terminals, to sell along with the refineries, one of the sources said.

Most of the bidding groups are expected to include private pipeline operators, possibly including France's Engie (PA: ) and Canada's Brookfield (TO: ), one of the sources said, explaining that oil companies are reaching out to them. Both companies recently acquired Petrobras assets.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusive-brazils-petrobras-refineries-sale-lures-trading-cos-petrochina-saudi-aramco--sources-1949850,0.015,0.935,0.05,0.9246

The stock market offers an incredible range of choice for investors. Even the blue-chip allows us to choose between many different types of company.

Good news, right? You can invest your cash and get exactly what you want.

Maybe. Or maybe not. There are some problems with investing in individual stocks. In this article I’ll explain why I think it makes much more sense to buy a FTSE 100 index tracker than to buy individual stocks.

Avoid this big risk To get a balanced, diversified portfolio of shares, most investors agree that you need somewhere between 15 and 30 stocks.

If you’re investing £1,000, you won’t have enough cash to achieve this. Investing in 15 stocks would only give you £66 per stock. Typical dealing costs of £10 would eat up 15% of your cash. It’s just not practical.

If you opt to put your money into just one or two stocks, then you run the risk of massive losses if anything goes wrong. All investors make mistakes and suffer big losses sometimes. As outsiders, we can never know everything about what’s happening inside a business.

Free protection The best way to protect yourself against this risk is through diversification. This means investing in a range of unrelated businesses, so that problems at one company will only have a small overall impact on your portfolio.

I reckon that investing in a FTSE 100 index tracker is the simplest way to achieve effective diversification. Even if you only invest small amounts, you get diversified exposure to about 100 companies, including well-known names such as Unilever (LON: ), Shell (LON: ), Tesco (LON: ) and Lloyds Bank.

A safe 4.6% income? Most of the businesses in the FTSE 100 are large and fairly mature. Unlike many smaller companies, they don’t need to invest all of their profits in growth opportunities.

Instead, a significant amount of each year’s profits are paid out in cash to shareholders. This is the dividend. It’s similar to interest on a savings account, except that dividends are not guaranteed.

However, although individual companies may cut their dividend in a given year, most will not. The dividend income available from the FTSE 100 is fairly stable.

At the time of writing, the FTSE 100 offered a dividend yield of 4.6%. That means that the companies in the FTSE are expected to pay out 4.6% of their market value in dividends this year.

This yield is above the historical average for the FTSE 100. It looks attractive to me. I can’t think of any other investments that will provide this level of income to investors in a cheap and simple investment.

I think it’s the right time to buy Political uncertainty is high. There’s no way of knowing whether the stock market will go up or down this autumn. But it’s worth remembering that many of the big companies in the FTSE 100 make most of their money outside the UK. Brexit may not have much impact on them.

History suggests that over long periods, the stock market tends to rise. In the meantime, investing in a FTSE 100 tracker fund will give you a reliable income that can be reinvested to boost your returns, or withdrawn in cash.

Uncertainty may be holding the market back — but such problems are usually solved eventually. I think that now could be a good time to buy a FTSE 100 tracker fund.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn, who has launched a proxy fight to win seats on Occidental Petroleum's (N: ) board, said on Wednesday he opposed efforts by the Houston-based company to name new directors without picking from his slate.

Icahn cited a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ) analyst's report published on Monday that quoted CEO Vicki Hollub as saying the oil producer's board planned to make governance changes, including the appointment of two ""qualified"" directors.

Occidental had previously dismissed his candidates as inadequate.

The activist investor owns nearly $2 billion (1.63 billion pounds) in shares of oil and gas producer Occidental, and last month launched a battle to remove four Occidental directors and replace them with his own, four-person slate.

On Wednesday, he blasted Hollub for looking for directors ""anywhere but in our direction,"" asking in an open letter to shareholders why his candidates had not been considered.

A spokesman for Occidental did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""We're going to keep fighting them,"" said Icahn in an interview on Wednesday. ""Unless we get on the board, we're not going away until the annual meeting"" next year, he said.

Icahn, who continues to seek support for a consent solicitation, predicted he would get 20% of Occidental shareholders to call on the company to set a record date for a vote.

""We have proposed four highly-qualified director candidates,"" Icahn said in his letter. His slate includes two executives of his hedge fund, the former finance chief of a U.S. consumer products company, and the former president of Royal Dutch Shell's (L: ) U.S. arm.

Occidental completed a $38 billion purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: ) this month, a deal that Icahn had opposed, calling it ""hugely overpriced.""

He criticized the firm's existing directors for failing to give shareholders a say on the purchase. He has claimed Occidental pursued Anadarko to avoid becoming a takeover candidate.

A suit against Occidental, seeking documents on its pursuit of Anadarko and deal with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) Corp will be heard in a Delaware court next month, he said.

Berkshire committed $10 billion to bankroll the Occidental-Anadarko deal on terms that Icahn said were too favorable to Berkshire.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/icahn-opposes-new-directors-chosen-by-occidental-ceo-1951634,0.048,0.906,0.047,-0.339

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Given a sad history of exploitation by foreigners, the young democracy of Timor-Leste can hardly be blamed for being hell-bent on self-sufficiency. But its current drive to cement its independence risks squandering the faltering progress the country has made. If the government doesn’t tread carefully, a future of debt peonage to China beckons.

Friday marks the 20th anniversary of the final dark episode in Timor-Leste’s 24-year occupation by Indonesia, which killed about 100,000 Timorese and came after centuries of colonial neglect by Portugal. On Aug. 30, 1999, a referendum delivered an overwhelming majority in favor of independence for the half-island also known as East Timor, but unleashed a wave of retaliation from Indonesian forces and militias that left more than 1,400 dead and destroyed public infrastructure.

Australia, the most forthright defender of Timor-Leste in that period, turned around to betray its new neighbor five years later. During negotiations over how to divide the oil and gas reserves along the undersea boundary between the two nations, Canberra used the cover of a foreign aid project to install listening devices in the office of Timor-Leste’s prime minister and eavesdropped on negotiating tactics, thus winning a larger share of resources for itself.

Timor-Leste has nonetheless managed to pick itself up. Gross domestic product per capita more than tripled in the first decade after formal independence in 2002, before slumping with oil prices in the years since. Infant mortality rates have been cut nearly in half, while secondary school enrollment has roughly doubled.

More to the point, the nation’s mineral wealth has been managed with more foresight than is normally the case with poor, newly independent states.

The country’s Petroleum Fund has assets of around $15.8 billion, equivalent to more than eight years’ worth of non-petroleum GDP. Relative to the size of the economy, that’s larger than the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait or Norway. Drawing on fund surpluses to finance budget deficits has left Timor-Leste with minimal levels of public debt. In terms of corruption, the country scores around the same levels as Brazil, Thailand and Colombia, and ahead of Vietnam – not a terrible result, given the circumstances.

It’s not all so positive. Half of employment is in agriculture, mostly at subsistence levels, and the country struggles to feed itself. Levels of undernourishment have declined only slightly and remain among the world’s highest.

Worse lies ahead. The Bayu-Undan offshore gasfield which has provided Timor-Leste’s petroleum wealth for the past few decades will run out by 2023. The Petroleum Fund will be exhausted a few years later, according to one 2014 study. Further revenues will depend on developing the nearby Greater Sunrise field – and there the problems of self-sufficiency become most apparent.

Bayu-Undan’s gas was brought ashore in the Australian city of Darwin, but Timor-Leste’s government is determined that Greater Sunrise product will be processed at home as the heart of a major new industrial zone, known as Tasi Mane.

For all the powerful nation-building symbolism and potential revenue from such a plant, Tasi Mane may never be viable – especially given the collapse in gas prices and extreme difficulty around the world in financing major new projects. Building a whole new facility on Timor-Leste’s coast will cost around $12 billion, according to a 2016 report, even making the dubious assumption that it’s physically possible to build a pipeline through the seismically unstable Timor Trough to get there. A far better option would be to hook into the ready-made export terminal in Darwin or use a floating LNG plant instead – but those have been ruled out by Timor-Leste’s government.

“The Timorese leadership has thrown all their economic eggs in this one basket because it has limited other options,” said Bec Strating, an expert on the country at Melbourne’s La Trobe University, “but I’ve never met an oil or gas expert who thinks this is a workable project.”

The original commercial partners in Greater Sunrise are voting with their feet. Timor-Leste spent $650 million over the past year buying ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc out of the venture, leaving only Woodside Petroleum Ltd. and Osaka Gas Co. The former has been adamant it won’t put significant amounts into developing Tasi Mane.

With commercial finance steering clear, the most likely option increasingly looks like China’s Belt and Road Initiative. National oil company Timor Gap earlier this year signed a $943 million construction contract with a unit of state-owned China Railway Construction Corp. Countries in the region “go where they can to obtain either grants or soft loans,” former Timorese President Jose Ramos-Horta said in an interview with SBS News last year. “And that, today, is China.”

Such a prospect risks a tragic waste of Timor-Leste’s potential. The Belt and Road is already notorious for building costly bridges to nowhere that leave governments with little to show beyond hefty interest bills. China’s growing presence in the Indo-Pacific via the Belt and Road has raised concerns that military and strategic aims, rather than purely commercial logic, underlie many of the projects. A $500 million highway built for Tasi Mane by a Chinese consortium in recent years and a $120 million airport are looking like white elephants.

Gas-export plants are in any case too narrow a base for a national economy, with just 350 local employees at the ConocoPhillips terminal in Darwin. More likely, the orgy of contracts that a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure project would kick off will offer a potent temptation for the sort of public corruption that Timor-Leste has so far mostly been spared.

It’s understandable that this young country feels betrayed by its neighbors. Entering a new abusive relationship with Beijing isn’t likely to be the right way to secure its future.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/tiny-nationshould-beware-chinas-belt-and-road-1951648,0.103,0.808,0.089,-0.9718

The safety of cash can be seductive. It’s like a comfort blanket. And I agree that it’s important to keep cash on hand to pay for emergencies and major spending such as holidays.

But if you think that saving in cash will help to make you richer or fund your retirement, I think you’re likely to be disappointed.

Today’s world of ultra-low interest rates means that earning 1.5% on a cash ISA is about as good as it gets. At that rate, it would take about 48 years for your cash to double in value.

It gets worse That’s bad enough. After all, I suspect most of you reading this hope to retire in less than 48 years.

But as my father-in-law pointed out recently, the longer you keep cash in the bank, the less it’s worth. That’s because of inflation, otherwise known as the rising cost of living.

Depending on which measure you choose, UK inflation is currently running at between 2% and 2.8%.

With inflation at 2%, it will take 36 years for the cost of living to double.

With inflation at 2.8%, it will take just 26 years.

In either case, we can see that our Cash ISA savings will buy less in the future than they do today.

It seems clear to me that saving in cash is not a suitable way to build retirement wealth. So what should we do instead?

Are you missing out? A recent survey found that just 2.2m people in the UK have subscribed to a Stocks and Shares ISA this year. That suggests that millions of us are missing out on a useful and tax-free way to make our spare cash work harder.

According to Barclays (LON: ), the long-term average return from the UK stock market is 8% per year. In my view, investing some spare cash in stocks and shares is a no-brainer if you’re trying to build up your retirement savings.

Although the value of your investments can fall as well as rise, in my experience the stock market isn’t as risky as it’s made out to be. Put your cash into a tracker fund and you’ll avoid the kind of speculative, fly-by-night stocks that give investing a bad name.

Instead, you’ll own shares in a diversified group of larger, well-established companies. These have usually been in business for many years and tend to have reliable profits. Examples include Tesco (LON: ), Unilever (LON: ), Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), Vodafone (LON: ) and pharmaceutical group GlaxoSmithKline. I own shares in several of these firms myself.

Start from £25 per month At the time of writing, the FTSE 100 offers a dividend yield of 4.6%. By investing in a FTSE 100 tracker fund you’ll receive this income each year plus any gains (or falls) in the value of the index.

Most tracker funds allow monthly payments from as little as £25, so you don’t have to make a big commitment upfront. Hold your fund in a Stocks and Shares ISA and all future capital gains and income will be tax-free.

You can still subscribe to a Cash ISA in the same year as well, if you’d like. The rules allow you to subscribe to one of each type of ISA each year, as long as your total contributions stay within the annual limit of £20,000.

What are you waiting for?

Car reseller Lookers (LSE:LOOK) has some really attractive headline figures. A dividend nearing 8%, trading at an excessively cheap four times price-to-earnings ratio and the share price has gained 15% after an all-time low. So is it worth a punt?

As they say in the used car game: always look under the bonnet. You might drive away with what you think is a great deal before it craps out on you and you’re left stranded.

Margins remain tight at 111-year-old Lookers. In 2018, revenue was £4.87bn and profit before tax was £53m. The year before? Revenue was £4.69bn and pre-tax profit £58m.

Higher revenue and lower profits is never good news but the shares tanked 20% in June on news that the Financial Conduct Authority watchdog was probing sales processes for the first six months of 2019. It could mean large fines and a costly restructuring. In response, management spent £10m on an internal review, including £3m on staff retraining, changing sales processes and a detailed review of past business.

Opportunity costs Falling pre-tax profits of nearly 30% for the first half of 2019 represented “an ongoing backdrop of challenging UK market conditions“, according to chief executive Andy Bruce. The UK car market is weak and Lookers’ rivals have been feeling the pain of sales slumps too. Prospects of a no-deal Brexit means less spending by big companies on fewer fleet buys, which make up a large proportion of the leasing side of the business.

Earnings per share are slated to plunge from 15.1p to 8.3p per share between now and 2020. Declining profits and falling EPS will put serious pressure on that headline 8% dividend. Buyer beware.

Energy boost stalwart Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE:RDSB) is currently trading at under 10 times earnings, with a 6.4% dividend on the cards. The energy giant reports its earnings in dollars, which means it is less likely to be affected by a plunging pound in the wake of October’s potential no-deal Brexit.

Dividends per share have been rock solid over the past 10 years, as well as increasing year-on-year. Payouts haven’t dropped below 6.5% since 2014 and cover is better than any time over the last five years with analysts expecting it to rise from 1.3 to 1.6 times earnings.

Shell is almost exactly the same age as the century-old Lookers, but operates with much more efficiency. The future looks bright too. Falling prices are an issue, but Shell is transitioning away from fossil fuels at a rapid rate. A takeover of First Utility in early 2019 saw it switch 700,000 UK households to 100% renewable energy, including biomass. This shows that chief executive Ben Van Buerden knows which way the wind is blowing.

There’s a reason Shell tends to show up in the UK’s most popular funds. Its valuation looks attractive to me as it trades near its 52-week low. While it’s no small-cap rocket, growth prospects are strong at 6.6% year-on-year and management has indicated it will keep up with $10bn a year of share buybacks to increase shareholder value.

(Bloomberg) -- A decision to close Europe’s biggest field is starting to raise concerns about the impact on the region’s biggest trading hub for the fuel.

The Dutch Title Transfer Facility has grown into Europe’s largest gas market in the past few years, surpassing the U.K., partly because of the scale of flows converging in the Netherlands.

A plan to shut down production at the Groningen field in the northeast corner of the Netherlands will make the nation dependent on imported gas. That’s prompting questions about how the trading hub will work in the future, according to Annie Krist, chief executive officer at GasTerra, a venture between Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). and the Dutch state that handles flows from the field.

“The Netherlands has a very liquid and attractive natural gas trading hub,” Krist said in a rare interview. “TTF is growing so well, that people seem to forget how we got there. If we don’t have Groningen’s flows, how is it going to be? Countries that are used to being dependent on imports, have other market mechanisms.”

After earthquakes caused by the earth settling as gas drained from the Groningen reservoir, the Dutch government has ordered the field to shut down gradually by 2030. That will remove both a source of flows and some flexibility for the market.

Five years ago, GasTerra handled more than a fifth of all the gas produced in Europe. It’s already been forced to adapt to output constraints at Groningen when tremors damaged nearby buildings.

But shutting down completely is a bigger step, one that’s left Krist concerned about the impact on the broader industry in the Netherlands.

“That was the first moment when we heard about zero,” “Zero really means no more gas. And that for a country that is dependent on gas.”

The giant Groningen field has been fueling Europe’s energy needs, and the Dutch budget, since 1963. Its importance, coupled with the development of sufficient infrastructure for gas transportation and trading, helped the TTF take the crown of Europe’s biggest market from the U.K.‘s National Balancing Point in 2016.

But intensive gas production has generated a series of earthquakes, affecting inhabitants in the region and damaging the image of gas as a source of energy. The insecurity has forced the government to curb production, with output in the year to October seen rising to that limit, which is just a fifth of the field’s peak in 1975-76 .

The Economy Ministry vowed last year to close Groningen by 2030. Following further tremors related to production, its output after October is uncertain limbo after the nation’s highest court demanded the ministry better explain how it weighed safety concerns of people in the region against security of supply.

And not only production levels are unclear. The TTF’s role is also in question as the Netherlands goes from an exporter to “a normal European importing country,” according to Krist.

“It will be interesting to see what balance we will have in terms of physical flows and how the liquidity in the hub will evolve as we shut down Groningen,” said Krist. “Whether or not players will think that the country is still interesting, is yet to be seen.”

In 2018, gas imports exceeded exports for the first time in the Netherlands, with the bulk of supplies coming from Norway, according to the Dutch national statistics office. The Netherlands will account for more than 60% of the decline in the region’s supply from 2018 to 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

“The main question for me is how quickly the Netherlands will be able to adapt as it becomes a gas importer,” said Gergely Molnar, a gas analyst in Europe at the International Energy Agency. “A trading hub is trusted by market participants if it is always able to deliver the physical volumes. So the Dutch gas infrastructure must adapt to the changing trading balance.”

The country now needs to build up more import capabilities, conversion facilities and preserve seasonal storage capacity, he said.

So far, Groningen’s production reductions hasn’t had any effect on TTF’s liquidity. The Dutch gas hub’s ratio of traded volume to actual physical throughput, known as churn, surpassed 100 for the first time in July, according to Molnar. That compares with a rate of 10 to 30 for the NBP, 50 to 90 for the U.S. Henry Hub and below 1 for the barely liquid Japan-Korea Marker.

“History doesn’t show a strong correlation between a gas production cut and the hub liquidity,” said Molnar. “TTF has become important because of a number of factors beyond production, including infrastructure, legal framework and the private sector’s willingness to invest in gas trading capabilities.”

Compensating

As Groningen ramps down, the Netherlands is becoming more reliant on its so-called small fields to meet export obligations, most of which are in the final phase of their production cycle and produce gas that’s too rich to be pumped directly into the region’s networks.

“Amid restrictions, we have to decide on a day-by-day basis how much Groningen gas we need to add to other sources to guarantee security of supply,” GasTerra’s Krist said. “We have to secure the right balance, which is much harder now than it was in the past.”

And with the Netherlands losing its role as a large producer, companies are questioning their own future. GasTerra’s shareholders are discussing what to do with the whole value chain as Groningen production declines, “including the role of GasTerra in it”, said Krist.

The Dutch government last year launched fiscal benefits for investments in gas exploration in the North Sea in order to try to preserve the offshore gas sector.

“That Groningen production would reduce was foreseen, but it’s happening much sooner than originally was anticipated,” she said. “It has not been business as usual in the last couple of years, and it definitely won’t be. We need to adapt to this situation quite significantly.”",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/dutch-closing-europes-biggest-gas-field-raises-concerns-for-hub-1947495,0.035,0.884,0.081,0.9928

SHEL +0.46% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio MS +0.27% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

(Bloomberg) -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc has taken the plunge into Australia’s energy market with a $418 million deal to buy ERM Power Ltd., the nation’s second-largest electricity retailer to commercial and industrial customers, as it drives toward a goal to become the world’s top power producer by 2030.

Shell had previously expressed interest in deeper involvement in Australia’s electricity sector as it pivots toward gas and power amid the global shift to cleaner energy. ERM owns two gas-fired generators, as well as the retail business, which Shell said will play an important role as Australia makes the switch away from coal-fired power. The deal is expected to close this year.

“This acquisition aligns with Shell’s global ambition to expand our integrated power business and builds on Shell Energy Australia’s existing gas marketing and trading capability,” Zoe Yujnovich, the company’s Australia chairman, said in a statement.

The cash offer of A$2.465 ($1.67) per share is a 43% premium to ERM’s closing price Wednesday and has the unanimous approval of ERM’s board. Company founder and major shareholder, Trevor St. Baker, also intends to vote in favor:

“Shell has the resources and networks to further ERM Power’s significant potential,” he said in a statement.

Australia’s energy sector is facing headwinds from a highly competitive retail market and regulatory intervention, which is having an impact on margins, Origin Energy Ltd. CEO Frank Calabria said in a statement to accompany the group’s annual earnings on Thursday.

“If the transaction proceeds, and Shell seeks to expand market share, we would see this as a competitive negative, at the margin, for incumbents AGL and Origin,” Rob Koh, utilities analyst at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), said in a note to clients.

ERM’s shareholders would vote on the deal around early November, the company said, and directors plan to support the transaction in the absence of a superior proposal. “If there is somebody out there, then this is the opportunity for them to come forward,” CEO Jon Stretch said on a media call.

Luminis Partners is ERM’s financial adviser, with Herbert Smith Freehills acting as legal adviser. Shell is being advised by UBS Group AG and Ashurst.

By Nia Williams (NYSE: )

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Two major oil companies have asked Canada's energy regulator to urgently review Enbridge Inc's (TO: ) proposal to switch to fixed contracts on its Mainline pipeline system, arguing the changes would be an abuse of Enbridge's market power.

Suncor Energy (TO: ), Canada's second-largest oil producer, and Shell Canada Ltd, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) wrote to the National Energy Board on Friday opposing Enbridge's plans.

They join MEG Energy (TO: ) and the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) in a growing chorus of dissent against Enbridge's proposal to introduce long-term fixed-volume contracts on North America's largest pipeline system.

The 2.85-million-barrel-per-day Mainline carries the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States, and currently allocates capacity on a monthly basis. It is a crucial conduit for producers at a time when pipeline capacity is so constrained the Alberta government last week extended mandatory production curtailments.

Enbridge launched a two-month open season to solicit bids from shippers for contracted space on 90% of the Mainline's capacity.

Suncor and Shell asked the NEB, which will ultimately approve or reject Enbridge's application, to review the terms on offer before the open season closes on Oct. 2.

""Suncor continues to believe that the terms and conditions of the open season are not fair, just or reasonable,"" the company said in a lawyers' letter.

Canadian shippers fear U.S. refiners like BP Plc (L: ) and ExxonMobil Corp (N: ) will snap up the bulk of Mainline capacity. They are also concerned the contracts will tie them into delivering crude to the Midwest region, limiting their ability to reach more liquid markets like the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Shell said congestion on Canadian export pipelines meant Enbridge was effectively forcing shippers to sign up for unfair tolls on long-term committed capacity or risk being left without market access.

""Shell is concerned that the open season and the offering may represent an abuse of market power,"" Shell Canada president Michael Crothers said in the letter.

Enbridge has not publicly disclosed the terms on offer.

Guy Jarvis, Enbridge's executive vice president of liquids pipelines, said it was premature to ask the NEB to intervene before Oct. 2. The company will submit an application with finalised terms and tolls once the open season ends.

""It seems it is getting the cart before the horse because the results of the open season will inform our application,"" Jarvis told Reuters.

The NEB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/suncor-and-shell-urge-canadian-regulator-to-review-contentious-enbridge-pipeline-plan-1949648,0.068,0.869,0.063,-0.8565

(Bloomberg) -- Capital keeps marching out of Canada’s oil industry, with Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE: ).’s sale of its remaining holdings in the country on Wednesday adding to more than $30 billion of foreign-company divestitures in the past three years.

Pembina Pipeline Corp., based in Calgary, is snapping up Kinder’s Canadian assets and a cross-border pipeline in a $3.3 billion deal. For Houston-based Kinder, the deal completes an exit from a country that has frustrated more than a few companies -- from ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc to Marathon Oil Corp (NYSE: ).

The drumbeat of exits, rare for such a stable oil-producing country, adds an extra layer of gloom for an industry that accounts for about a fifth of Canada’s exports. The energy sector -- centered around Alberta’s oil sands -- has struggled to rebound since the 2014 crash in global oil prices, with capital spending declining for five straight years and job cuts pushing the province’s unemployment rate above 6%. Alberta is forecast to post the slowest growth of any region in Canada this year.

The situation isn’t likely to improve any time soon, with key pipelines like TC Energy Corp.’s Keystone XL and Enbridge Inc.’s expansion of its Line 3 conduit bogged down by legal challenges. The lack of pipelines has weighed on Canadian heavy crude prices for years, sending them to a record low late in 2018.

“If they thought things were getting better in Canada, they might hold on, but they don’t see things getting better,” Laura Lau, who helps manage more than C$2 billion ($1.5 billion) at Brompton Corp. in Toronto, said in an interview. “The pipeline situation is getting worse; everything is getting worse.”

Other recent major divestitures include ConocoPhillips’ $13.2 billion sale of oil-sands and assets to Cenovus Energy Inc. in 2017, and Shell’s and Marathon’s sales of their stakes in an oil-sands project to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. for about $10.7 billion that same year. Canadian Natural also bought Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy Corp (NYSE: ).’s Canadian heavy oil assets this year for $2.79 billion. Norway’s Equinor ASA pulled out in 2016 after facing pressure at home to invest in lower-emission projects.

While a government curtailment program has boosted oil sands prices to more normal levels, the system has prevented companies from investing in new deposits. What’s more, the oil sands are often viewed by investors as a higher-cost jurisdiction that produces a lower quality of heavy crude. Those persistent drags are likely to keep Canadian assets at the top of international companies’ lists for potential disposal, Lau said.

Kinder Morgan is in many ways the perfect example of the troubles -- including slow-moving regulatory processes, an active environmental movement, and a variety of inter-provincial squabbles. The company bought the Trans Mountain pipeline, which carries crude and other products from Edmonton to a shipping terminal in Vancouver, for about $5.6 billion in 2005 in a bid to gain exposure to the oil sands -- the world’s third-largest crude reserves.

But a plan to roughly triple the capacity of the line got bogged down amid opposition from indigenous groups, environmentalists and British Columbia’s government. Kinder threatened to scrap the expansion, which all but forced Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to step in and buy the entire line for about $3.45 billion last year. The project took an initial step forward on Thursday as contractors were given approval to start some work on the line.

Bad Signal

“When they sold Trans Mountain, there wasn’t much left, and it was just a matter of time for them to exit Canada completely,” Lau said. “But definitely another foreign company exiting Canada doesn’t send a good signal.”

Not all foreign operators have abandoned Canada. Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). still has a sizable presence with its controlling stake in Imperial Oil Ltd., a C$25 billion company. Shell, based in The Hague, still owns a refining complex and natural gas production in Alberta and British Columbia. France’s Total SA (PA: ) owns a portion of the Fort Hills mine, and Japanese and Chinese companies also have oil-sands projects. Conoco still has an oil-sands facility and holdings in the Montney shale play.

A potential catalyst for the sector could be the election of a Conservative government in Canada’s federal election in October, said Rafi Tahmazian, senior portfolio manager at Canoe Financial. That may change global investors’ perceptions about the support the industry would receive from the government.

“The silver lining in this whole process is that Canada owns Canada again, and we got it pretty cheap,” Tahmazian said in an interview. “Now the question is can we take advantage of that by allowing ourselves a more friendly environment for foreign investment?”

With the State Pension age expected to rise to 68 in the next couple of decades, building a large nest egg during your working life could become increasingly important. After all, the State Pension currently stands at just £8,767 per year, which is unlikely to be sufficient for most people to enjoy financial freedom in older age.

As such, buying growth shares could be a worthwhile move. Through delivering strong growth in the long run, they may be able to bring your retirement date a step closer.

With that in mind, here are two large-cap shares that could be worth buying right now in order to enhance your retirement savings prospects.

Burberry Burberry (LSE: BRBY) is in the process of implementing a revised strategy that will see it close underperforming stores and focus on its luxury offering. This is intended to strengthen its brand over the long run, while the company also focuses on enhancing the customer offering and reducing costs.

Alongside this, the company is seeking to more closely align itself with changing consumer tastes. For example, it is increasing its presence on social media, while aiming to become a more sustainable business.

So far, the changes being made to its business model appear to be having a positive impact on the company’s performance. Its recent updates have shown that it is on-track to deliver improving financial performance in the long run.

Of course, economic uncertainties in key markets such as China could cause a degree of volatility in the short run. However, with Burberry having a strong brand and set to become more efficient, its long-term financial prospects appear to be bright.

Shell (LON: ) The recent decline in Shell’s (LSE: RDSB) share price could provide an investment opportunity. The oil and gas company’s shares have declined by around 12% in less than a month, with there being the potential for further uncertainty due to fears surrounding the prospects for the world economy.

While buying Shell shares now may produce paper losses in the short run if the oil price remains under pressure, history has shown that buying high-quality stocks during periods of market turbulence can lead to relatively high returns in the long run.

Since the stock trades on a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.3, it appears to offer a wide margin of safety. In other words, its recent share price fall may factor in the risks that the business currently faces.

While capital growth may prove to be elusive over the near term, investors in Shell are set to benefit from a dividend yield of around 6.3%. Since the company’s dividend payments are covered 1.7 times by net profit, they appear to be sustainable.

As such, over the long run, the company’s total returns could help you to beat the State Pension and retire early.

Everyone’s heard of the (or ‘Footsie’ in popular parlance). When the general news media features the UK ‘stock market’, it’s invariably with reference to the FTSE 100. As such, many people who decide to invest in the stock market choose a Footsie tracker.

In this article, I’m going to discuss another UK index for which trackers are readily available — the index — and tell you three reasons why I think this index is a better choice for investors than the FTSE 100.

Reason #1 As its name suggests, the FTSE 100 is an index of 100 companies. They’re the biggest companies listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. The FTSE All-Share index includes all the FTSE 100 companies and over 500 more.

With an All-Share tracker your money is invested in a far wider range of businesses, including in sectors that aren’t represented, or are poorly represented, in the FTSE 100. For example, to name just three, there are no pub groups, cinema chains or self-storage operators in the Footsie. Meanwhile, an All-Share investor has a little money in these sectors, via the likes of Wetherspoons, Cineworld and Big Yellow.

The greater number of companies and the greater range of sectors is the first reason why I’d buy an All-Share tracker instead of a FTSE 100 tracker.

Reason #2 Both indexes are weighted by market capitalisation (market cap for short). The market cap of a company is simply its share price multiplied by the number of shares it has in issue. Oil giant Shell (LON: ) is the biggest company in the FTSE 100 with a market cap of getting on for £200bn. Its index weighting is over 50 times that of current number 100 Marks & Spencer, whose market cap is around £3.5bn.

The FTSE 100 companies represent about 85% of an All-Share tracker, but having another 15% in companies outside the Footsie usefully dampens the dominance of the ‘megacaps’ like Shell. The table below shows the weightings of the top five companies in HSBC’s FTSE 100 and FTSE All-Share trackers (as of 30/4/19).

HSBC FTSE 100 Index (%) HSBC FTSE All-Share Index (%) Royal Dutch Shell 11.0 8.7 HSBC 7.0 5.5 BP (LON: ) 5.8 4.5 AstraZeneca 4.5 3.8 Diageo (LON: ) 4.2 3.4

In the FTSE 100 tracker, the biggest five holdings represent almost a third of the index, while in the All-Share tracker it’s nearer a quarter. I think the latter is preferable, and this is the second reason why I’d choose an All-Share tracker over a FTSE 100 tracker.

Reason #3 Last but not least of my three reasons is performance. The table below shows the total return (including reinvested dividends) of HSBC’s FTSE 100 and FTSE All-Share trackers over one, three and five years.

1 year (%) 3 years (%) 5 years (%) HSBC FTSE 100 Index -1.6 18.3 28.2 HSBC FTSE All-Share Index -2.0 18.4 30.6

These figures reflect the broader history of the relative returns of the two indexes. Briefly put, the FTSE 100 has tended not to fall as far as the All-Share when markets drop (as in the one-year figures), but the All-Share has tended to outperform over the long term (as in the five-year figures).

Foolish bottom line A FTSE 100 tracker can do a very decent job for investors. However, for reasons of diversification, company weightings and long-term performance, I think a FTSE All-Share tracker could be a superior option.

Briefly put, the FTSE 100 has tended not to fall as far as the All-Share when markets drop (as in the one-year figures), but the All-Share has tended to outperform over the long term (as in the five-year figures).

Foolish bottom line A FTSE 100 tracker can do a very decent job for investors. However, for reasons of diversification, company weightings and long-term performance, I think a FTSE All-Share tracker could be a superior option.

Playing the National Lottery can be an alluring way to make a vast amount of money. With jackpots of more than £100m on offer, paying just £2 for a chance to win this life-changing sum seems like a no-brainer.

However, your chances of winning the jackpot are so small, rather than winning money, it’s more likely you’ll spend your entire life throwing cash away.

You might have more chances in the casino at the blackjack tables. The National Lottery is classed as gambling, so it’s technically the same thing.

So, rather than gambling on the National Lottery, I would invest my money in stocks instead. Indeed, that’s just what I’m doing as I believe I’ve a much higher chance of making a life-changing sum of money from these companies over the long term than buying lottery tickets.

Investing for the long term What I am looking for is blue-chip companies that have a definite competitive advantage in their respective industries and a history of changing with the times. In other words, I’m looking for firms like Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), which is one of the world’s largest energy traders, and has been around for more than 100 years.

Another example is life insurance and long-term savings provider Legal & General. This company dominates the pensions market in the UK, managing more than £1trn of assets for clients. It can also trace its history back more than a century. I would also include consumer goods giant Unilever (LON: ) and defence products giant BAE Systems (LON: ).

These are just a handful of some of the blue-chips you could buy instead of spending your money on the National Lottery. I calculate a basket of these four companies would offer a dividend yield of just under 6%. That’s a potential return of 6% per annum without including any capital growth.

Assuming earnings per share expand in line with inflation (2.5%) for the foreseeable future, shareholders could see a total return of as much as 8.5% per annum.

It all adds up It currently costs £2 per line of numbers to play the National Lottery. Four lines twice a week would cost a total of £16 per week, or £832 a year. But what about if you took this money and invested it in an equally weighted basket of the shares I’ve laid out above?

Well, assuming an investor starts with a base portfolio of £1,000, with £250 invested in each of Royal Dutch Shell, Legal & General, Unilever and BAE Systems, I calculate they could accumulate a portfolio worth £15,226 over 10 years.

This is based on the assumption that rather than wasting £16 a week on the lottery, this money is invested back into the portfolio. Assuming an average annual rate of return of 8.5% per annum, these deposits will help the overall balance grow to more than £15,000.

If you spent the same amount on the National Lottery, it’s more than likely you would have nothing to show for it. That’s why I’d rather buy FTSE 100 stocks than play the National Lottery.

By Sonali Paul

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) has made its first foray into Australia's highly competitive power sector with a A$617 million (344.59 million pounds) takeover offer for ERM Power Ltd (AX: ), the country's no.2 energy retailer to businesses and industry.

The deal would instantly give Shell a power supplier with almost a quarter share of the commercial and industrial retail market in Australia, second only to Origin Energy (AX: ) in that space. It will also get two gas-fired power stations.

Shell, already one of Australia's biggest gas producers, wants to use its global scale in oil and gas to build a power business, as the world rapidly shifts towards cleaner energy. It plans to boost annual spending on the strategy to between $2 billion and $3 billion by 2025.

""This acquisition aligns with Shell's global ambition to expand our integrated power business and builds on Shell Energy Australia's existing gas marketing and trading capability,"" Shell Australia's Country Chair Zoe Yujnovich said in a statement.

ERM agreed to the offer, pitched at a big 43% premium to its last closing price, and recommended shareholders should accept it in a vote expected in November.

ERM's founder and top shareholder, Trevor St Baker, who speaks for 27% of the company's shares, said in a statement he would accept the offer of A$2.465 a share if no higher bid emerges.

Shell, which was advised by UBS, said Australia is one of the core markets for its new 'Emerging Power' theme, focused on strong growth in renewables to complement traditional fuels.

The ERM acquisition fits well with Shell's recent takeover of German solar battery maker sonnen, which has a presence in Australia, giving Shell a small foothold in selling to households alongside ERM's big business customers.

The power business will also give Shell another product to sell to its long established big fuel customers, like miners.

ERM Chief Executive Jon Stretch said there was little overlap with Shell's existing business in Australia, so he expected most of ERM's staff would remain with the business.

""It's clear that there's little in the way of overlap and cost synergies and the focus will be on combining for growth opportunities,"" he told reporters on a conference call.

ERM's shares soared to a four and a half-year high of A$2.50 after the bid was announced and last traded at A$2.44, just below the offer price, indicating investors don't expect a higher offer to emerge.

The company on Thursday reported underlying earnings of $90.5 million for the 2019 financial year, down 7% from a year earlier, as sales fell 8% to 17.7 terrawatt hours (TWh) of power. It forecast sales would grow to 18.5 TWh this year.

Origin Energy, which also reported its results on Thursday, said it was undaunted by the pending entry of Shell in power retailing, saying Origin has managed to grow its share of commercial and industrial customers even with ERM as a strong competitor to date.

""It continues to be a competitive market. It's hard to anticipate what they may do differently,"" Origin Chief Executive Frank Calabria told Reuters in an interview.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/shell-eyes-australia-power-sector-with-bid-for-energy-retailer-erm-power-1947124,0.006,0.88,0.114,0.9942

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were broadly mixed after early trading on Thursday, with stronger-than-expected business surveys in the eurozone’s two biggest economies failing to generate any noticeable feelgood factor.

‘Flash’ readings of IHS Markit’s purchasing managers’ indexes for and all beat expectations, both in manufacturing and services, and suggested that the euro zone will avoid a recession despite signs that Germany, its largest single economy, is headed for one.

By 5 AM ET, the benchmark was down 0.3%, while the German was down 0.2%. The U.K. , buffeted all week by political noise about an increasingly likely ‘No-Deal Brexit’ was down 0.6%.

Italy’s led the way for a second straight day, rising 0.5% on hopes that snap elections can be avoided. The country’s president is due to sound out the center-left Democratic Party later Thursday about its willingness to govern together with 5 Stars, something that has seemed highly unlikely until this week.

“The rebound in the Euro-area PMIs was mildly positive news, but the details remain worrying,” said Nordea Markets’ strategist Jan von Gerich “The euro-area economy is too weak to generate meaningful inflation pressures, which means the ECB needs to do more,” he said. He added that the forward-looking components of the services PMI had also fallen, suggesting that the one sector that has propped up the economy so far this year is now also faltering.

Markets were generally in holding mode, awaiting the start of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s conference in Jackson Hole, where Chairman Jerome Powell will take center stage on Friday.

Among the notable gainers were NMC Health (LON: ), a London-listed healthcare group focused on the Middle East, which rose as much as 42% after an unconfirmed report that two competing interests want to buy up to 40% of the company from its largest shareholders at a substantial premium. The shares retraced later but were still up 26% on the day, after the company reported quarterly figures in line with consensus.

Elsewhere in the health space, medical device maker Ambu (CSE: ) slumped nearly 20% after warning again on profits.

In energy, Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) continued took another baby step into the world of electricity supply, paying $418 million for ERM, an Australian supplier of power to business consumers.

You’ve paid off any high-interest debt. You’ve built a fund of cash to guard against a rainy day. You’ve discovered that over long periods the stock market has outperformed other assets, and you’re ready to invest.

Like many first-time investors, you may have decided to go for a FTSE UK index tracker, and you’re now trying to figure out which FTSE index is the best to buy. In this article, I’ll go through the options and their key characteristics, and hopefully by the end you’ll have a clearer idea.

Options Low-cost trackers are available for the three main FTSE UK indexes. The indexes are the FTSE 100, the and the .

The companies in the indexes are weighted by market capitalisation (market cap, for short). This simply means the bigger the company, the more its performance contributes to the index.

The FTSE 100 consists of the 100 stocks with the biggest market caps. Most are multinational giants and household names, like BP (LON: ), HSBC and Unilever (LON: ). The biggest of the lot, Shell (LON: ), has a market cap of around £190bn (and a weighting of over 10% in the index). Companies at the lower end, such as Marks & Spencer, ITV (LON: ) and Rightmove, have market caps around the £4bn mark, and weightings of about 0.2%.

The FTSE 250 consists of the next-biggest 250 companies after the FTSE 100. Their market caps range from around £4bn down to around £700m. You’ll still find a fair few familiar names in the FTSE 250, including Royal Mail (LON: ), National Express and Greggs.

Finally, the FTSE All-Share consists of all the companies in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250, plus all the companies in the index. There are currently around 270 in the latter, with market caps between about £700m and £130m and one or two household names among them, such as Halfords. There are no trackers available for just the FTSE SmallCap index.

Which tracker should I buy? The FTSE 100 is a popular pick with new investors and has a decent long-term record. Historically, though, the price you pay for the comfort of being invested in largely global giants has been a somewhat lower return than the FTSE 250. For example, the HSBC fund has delivered a five-year total return (includes reinvested dividends) of 28%, compared with 37% for its FTSE 250 tracker. Investors looking to build a large capital sum over the long term may be better served by the FTSE 250.

However, while the mature behemoths of the FTSE 100 generally have less scope for growth than the FTSE 250 ‘mid-caps’, they do pay more generous dividends. The running yield on the HSBC FTSE 100 Index fund is currently 4%, compared with 2.8% for its FTSE 250 tracker. Therefore, the FTSE 100 may be a better choice for investors wanting an immediate income from taking annual dividends in cash — for example, to supplement a pension in retirement. In this case, you’d want to invest in the tracker’s ‘income units’, as opposed to its ‘accumulation units’ that automatically reinvest your dividends.

Finally, weighting by market cap means a FTSE All-Share tracker is around 85% FTSE 100, 15% FTSE 250 and 5% FTSE SmallCap. HSBC’s All-Share tracker has delivered a five-year total return of 31% and carries a running dividend yield of 3.9%. It may not be the optimal choice for long-term capital growth or immediate income, but it might be considered a good all-rounder, with attractive diversification across the market cap scale.

(Bloomberg) -- The rivalry between U.S. and Middle Eastern oil producers has jumped up a notch as American crude makes its way right to the heart of Asia, the world’s most-prized energy market.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) Plc has offered a cargo of U.S. West Texas Intermediate Midland crude that’s priced off the Dubai benchmark in its debut during Asian hours on S&P Global Platts’ widely-referenced trading platform, according to two traders and data compiled by Bloomberg.

Offering the shipment -- scheduled to be delivered to Singapore, or Linggi or Nipah in Malaysia -- against the Middle East’s oil benchmark brings it into direct competition with Gulf grades produced in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. Once considered a one-off arbitrage, the flow of American oil to Asia has increased in recent years.

“It’s another tasty entree on the oil buffet table that may be quite appetizing for some of the Asian buyers,” said John Driscoll, chief strategist at JTD Energy Services Ltd. in Singapore. “Considering that exports have steadily been ramping up, this move could be disruptive for the traditional suppliers in the Middle East.”

While U.S. shipments of grades such as WTI Midland and Eagleford are typically priced off the American benchmark WTI, Shell’s offer makes it easier for buyers to compare it against similar-quality oil that refiners across South Korea, Japan and China typically take. The crude can be transferred to other vessels in the Malacca Strait near Singapore, making the logistics less complicated for buyers across Asia.

American exports have eroded the dominance of Middle Eastern crude in Asia, at a time when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are restricting their output in an effort to prop up prices. South Korean oil imports from the U.S. rose to about 8.5 million barrels in June, compared with 3 million barrels a year earlier. American shipments to Asia are likely to expand further due the start up of two Permian pipelines this year.

The offer by Shell was made for a WTI Midland cargo for delivery on Oct. 15-25 at a premium of $4.55 a barrel to Dubai benchmark price, the traders said. The deal was subject to the buyer’s acceptance of a vessel named Phoenix Jamnagar.

In the last few weeks, markets have crashed, with investors rattled over fears of trade wars and recessions. In the first two weeks of August, the fell almost 7%. But rather than panic, investors should see these falls as unique opportunities to buy high-quality companies at low prices.

One quality company I’m tempted to buy is Mondi (LSE: LON: ). Mondi is a global packaging and paper company, and a big one at that, with sales of €7.4 billion last year. The company has a track record of consistently growing revenues and profits, with after-tax profits up from €497 million in 2014, to €866 million in 2018.

After recently increasing the interim dividend, the shares now offer a very attractive 5% yield for the full year. The share price is the lowest it has been in three years, having fallen 16% since the end of July. At the time of writing, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is just 9, which in my opinion is far too low for a company of this quality.

Mondi has a promising future too, as demonstrated by a strong showing in the first half of 2019. Profit before tax was 29% higher than at the same stage last year, whilst its return on capital employed is industry-leading at 23%.

The company is focused on developing new, sustainable packaging solutions, such as flexible and hybrid plastics, that are environmentally friendly. Mondi is uniquely positioned – at the forefront of its industry – to benefit from a consumer that is increasingly concerned about plastic use and recyclability.

Another victim of the recent sell off is Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB), with the shares down 12% since the end of July.

Full year revenues grew by 30% in 2017, and by 27% last year. Impressive cost cutting has seen after-tax profits increase from just $2 billion in 2015, to $23.9 billion last year. The breakeven oil price for new projects is now just $30/ bl, meaning that Shell now makes more money with the oil price at $60/ bl, than it did five years ago, at $90/ bl.

I think that a dividend yield of 7% (at the time of writing) is probably enough of a reason to buy this stock. But that’s only half of the story. Shell also has a huge share buyback programme, where it’s committed to purchasing up to $25 billion of its own shares, between 2018 and 2020. By the time this is factored in, the real yield of the shares is nearer to 10%.

Management have even signalled an intention to return a further $125 billion to shareholders between 2021 and 2025, which would send the yield into nosebleed territory. All this is available at a P/E of less than 10.

Shell aims to pay for this through its continued focus on cash generation, and by divesting non-core assets. The company is positioning itself as a provider of low carbon energy, through both its new fuels offerings, and its emerging power solutions. Shell is not giving up on conventional oil and gas by any means, but it is trying to diversify into new growth areas, such as EV charging, battery storage, and renewables generation.

The buy-to-let market in the UK is huge and getting more so. And the numbers from rental app Bunk are there to prove it.

According to the online lettings platform, there are 5.2m tenants across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently renting in the private sector. By multiplying the number of renters in each of these regions with the average rental cost, Bunk calculated that the total UK private rental sector is worth a staggering £51.9bn.

To put this in perspective, that’s more than the gross domestic product of 130 nations. It’s also bigger than the market capitalisation of 90% of the , bigger than some of Britain’s stock market bruisers such as Lloyds (LON: ) (£35.5bn), Vodafone (LON: ) (£39.1bn) and Barclays (LON: ) (£25.5bn).

Company Market Cap (£bn) Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) 189.7 HSBC 128.3 Unilever (LON: ) 127.4 BP (LON: ) 104.4 AstraZeneca 93.6 BHP 89.8 GlaxoSmithKline 83.1 Diageo (LON: ) 80.2 Rio Tinto (LON: ) 71.6 British American Tobacco (LON: ) 68.6 UK Private Rental Sector 51.9 Reckitt Benckiser 42.7 Prudential (LON: ) 39.9 Vodafone 39.1 Relx 37.3 Lloyds 35.5 Compass 32.1 Glencore (LON: ) 30.9 National Grid (LON: ) 28.5 Anglo American (LON: ) 25.6 Barclays 25.5

Don’t be hasty Impressive data, huh? Well co-founder of Bunk, Tom Woollard, certainly thinks so and is quick to laud “the attractive proposition the buy-to-let sector still presents for landlords despite a number of changes that have dented the profitability of these investments.”

And he believes that buy-to-let still has plenty to offer potential investors. He comments that “with rents increasing and an acute shortage of properties being built for sale and to rent, we will surely see this upward trend climb further in the future.”

It’s certainly true that rents are on the march in the UK, but for beleaguered landlords, this doesn’t tell the whole story, as a recent report on buy-to-let confidence shows.

Sure, revenues might be increasing, but so are investor liabilities — take recent hikes in stamp duty, increased regulatory costs related to House of Multiple Occupation (HMO) changes, or unexpected fees brought on by the recent Tenant Fees Act, to name just a few. And the punishing landscape looks set to get ever tougher as Britain’s worsening housing crisis exacerbates government efforts to free up homes by pushing out landlords.

Dirt-cheap dividends! If it’s a choice between buy-to-let or investing in the FTSE 100, there really is no competition, in my opinion. Indeed, the share price washout of recent days provides a brand new opportunity for investors to nip in and grab a bargain.

Taylor Wimpey (LON: ) and Barratt Developments (LON: ) are a couple of blue-chips I myself own, and fresh falls here leave them dealing on forward P/E ratios of below 9 times. The good news doesn’t end here, either. At current prices, they sport monster prospective dividend yields of 7.3% and 12.3%.

If you’re worried about Brexit, though, and are after some emerging market exposure instead, how about buying up banking Goliath HSBC — with its low earnings multiple of 10 times for 2019 and 7.1% prospective dividend yield — or insurer Prudential and its corresponding readings of 8.5 times and 3.8%?

And for those worried about trans-Pacific trade wars and slowing global economies, there are always classic defensive shares like United Utilities to pick from (an earnings ratio of 13.7 times and a 5.4% dividend yield can be found here). So forget buy-to-let and go shopping on the Footsie, I say.

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's biggest asset could also be a liability.

The state energy giant's vast oil reserves – it can sustain current production levels for the next 50 years – make it more exposed than any other company to a rising tide of environmental activism and shift away from fossil fuels.

In the three years since Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman first proposed a stock market listing, climate change and new green technologies are putting some investors, particularly in Europe and the United States, off the oil and gas sector.

Sustainable investments account for more than a quarter of all assets under management globally, by some estimates.

Aramco, for its part, argues oil and gas will remain at the heart of the energy mix for decades, saying renewables and nuclear cannot meet rising global demand, and that its crude production has lower greenhouse gas emissions than its rivals.

But with the company talking again to banks about an initial public offering (IPO), some investors and lawyers say the window to execute a sale at a juicy price is shrinking and Aramco will need to explain to prospective shareholders how it plans to profit in a lower-carbon world.

""Saudi Aramco is a really interesting test as to whether the market is getting serious about pricing in energy transition risk,"" said Natasha Landell-Mills, in charge of integrating environment, social and governance (ESG) considerations into investing at London-based asset manager Sarasin & Partners.

""The longer that (the IPO) gets delayed, the less willing the market will be to price it favourably because gradually investors are going to need to ask questions about how valuable those reserves are in a world that is trying to get down to net zero emissions by 2050.""

Reuters reported on Aug. 8 that Prince Mohammed was insisting on a $2 trillion valuation even though some bankers and company insiders say the kingdom should trim its target to around $1.5 trillion.

A valuation gap could hinder any share sale. The IPO was previously slated for 2017 or 2018 and, when that deadline slipped, to 2020-2021.

Aramco told Reuters it was ready for a listing and the timing would be decided by the government.

The company also said it was investing in research to make cars more efficient, and working on new technologies to use hydrogen in cars, convert more crude to chemicals and capture CO2 which can be injected in its reservoirs to improve extraction of oil.

SELLING THE STORY

Some would argue this is not enough.

A growing number of investors across the world are factoring ESG risk into their decision-making, although the degree to which that would stop them investing in Aramco varies wildly.

Some would exclude the company on principle because of its carbon output, while others would be prepared to buy if the price was cheap enough to outweigh the perceived ESG risk - especially given oil companies often pay healthy dividends.

At a $1.5 trillion valuation, Aramco would be the world's largest public company. If it were included in major equity indices it would automatically be bought by passive investment funds that track them, regardless of their ESG credentials.

And as the world's most profitable company, Aramco shares would be snapped up by many active investors.

Talks about a share sale were revived this year after Aramco attracted huge investor demand for its first international bond issue. In its bond prospectus, it said climate change could potentially have a ""material adverse effect"" on its business.

When it comes to an IPO, equity investors require more information about potential risks and how companies plan to deal with them, as they are more exposed than bondholders if a business runs into trouble.

""Companies need to lead with the answers in the prospectus, rather than have two or three paragraphs describing potential risks from environmental issues,"" said Nick O'Donnell, partner in the corporate department at law firm Baker McKenzie.

""An oil and gas company needs to be thinking about how to explain the story over the next 20 years and bring it out into a separate section rather than hiding it away in the prospectus, it needs to use it as a selling tool. And also, once the IPO is done, every annual report should have a standalone ESG section.""

Unlike other major oil companies, Aramco doesn't have a separate report laying out how it addresses ESG issues such as labour practices and resource scarcity, while it does not publish the carbon emissions from products it sells. Until this year's bond issue, it also kept its finances under wraps.

The company does however have an Environmental Protection Department, sponsors sustainability initiatives and is a founding member of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, which is led by 13 top energy companies and aims to cut emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

On Aug. 12 Aramco published information on the intensity of its hydrocarbon mix for the first time. It disclosed the amount of greenhouse gases from each barrel it produces.

Aramco's senior vice president of finance Khalid al-Dabbagh said during an earnings call this month that its carbon emissions from ""upstream"" exploration and production were the lowest among its peers.

A study published by Science magazine last year found carbon emissions from Saudi Arabia's crude production were the world's second lowest after Denmark, as a result of having a small number of highly productive oilfields.

THE OIL PRICE

Aramco says that, with the global economy forecast to double in size by 2050, oil and gas will remain essential.

""Saudi Aramco is determined to not only meet the world's growing demand for ample, reliable and affordable energy but to meet the world's growing demand for much cleaner fuel,"" it told Reuters.

""Alternatives are still facing significant technological, economic and infrastructure hurdles, and the history of past energy transitions shows that these developments take time.""

The company has also moved to diversify into gas and chemicals and is using renewable energy in its facilities.

But Aramco still, ultimately, represents a bet on the price of oil.

It generated net income of $111 billion in 2018, over a third more than the combined total of the five ""super-majors"" ExxonMobil (N: ), Royal Dutch Shell (AS: ), BP (L: ), Chevron (N: ) and Total (PA: ).

In 2016, when the oil price hit 13-year lows, Aramco's net income was only $13 billion, according to its bond prospectus where it unveiled its finances for the first time, based on current exchange rates. Its earnings fell 12% in the first half of 2019, mainly on lower oil prices.

Concerns about future demand for fossil fuels have weighed on the sector. Since 2016, when Prince Mohammed first flagged an IPO, the 12-months forward price to earnings ratio of five of the world's top listed oil companies has fallen to 12 from 21 on average, according to Reuters calculations, lagging the and the STOXX Europe 600 Oil & Gas index averages.

AN INFLUX OF CAPITAL

Using a broad measure, there was global sustainable investment of $30.1 trillion across the world's five major markets at the end of 2018, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Review http://www.gsi-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GSIR_Review2018F.pdf, more than a quarter of all assets under management globally. That compares with $22.8 trillion in 2016.

""Given the influx of capital into the ESG space, Aramco's IPO would have been better off going public 5-10 years ago,"" said Joseph di Virgilio, global equities portfolio manager at New York-based Romulus Asset Management, which has $900 million in assets under management.

""An IPO today would still be the largest of its kind, but many asset managers focusing solely on ESG may not participate.""

The world's top listed oil and gas companies have come under heavy pressure from investors and climate groups in recent years to outline strategies to reduce their carbon footprint.

Shell, BP and others have agreed, together with shareholders, on carbon reduction targets for some of operations and to increase spending on renewable energies. U.S. major ExxonMobil, the world's top publicly traded oil and gas company, has resisted adopting targets.

Britain's biggest asset manager LGIM removed Exxon from its 5 billion pounds ($6.3 billion) Future World funds for what it said was a failure to confront threats posed by climate change. LGIM did not respond to a request for comment on whether it would buy shares in Aramco's potential IPO.

Sarasin & Partners said in July it had sold nearly 20% of its holdings in Shell, saying its spending plans were out of sync with international targets to battle climate change. The rest of the stake is under review.

The asset manager, which has nearly 14 billion pounds in assets under management, didn't participate in Aramco's bond offering and Landell-Mills said they would be unlikely to invest in any IPO.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/climate-change-could-rain-on-saudi-aramcos-ipo-parade-1945421,0.06,0.851,0.088,0.9952

LONDON (Reuters) - Aeroplanes could be powered by jet fuel made from household rubbish from 2024 under plans by Shell (L: ), British Airways and Velocys (L: ) to build Europe's first large-scale plant to produce jet fuel from domestic and commercial waste.

Aviation accounts for around 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions but this is predicted to grow as air travel increases, at a time when nations are seeking to limit emissions to curb climate change.

The aviation industry has a target to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050 compared with 2005 levels and sees the emergence of lower-carbon biofuels as a vital step to meeting this goal.

Shell, BA and Velocys - who have applied for planning permission for the plant from local authorities in North East Lincolnshire - are targeting domestic or commercial black bag waste that would otherwise end up in landfills or incinerators.

Waste-to-energy is already commonly used in the power sector, where household rubbish such as food or grass cuttings are burnt to create electricity.

""Sustainable fuels can be a game changer for aviation which will help power our aircraft for years to come,"" said British Airways Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Cruz.

Construction on the Altalto Immingham project, near the Humber Estuary in the northeast of England, could begin in 2021 with the site producing commercial volumes of sustainable aviation fuel three years later. Altalto Immingham Ltd is a subsidiary of fuel technology firm Velocys.

A planning decision by the North East Lincolnshire Council is expected by the end of November.

The three companies have invested a combined 7.3 million pounds in the project so far, which is ultimately expected to cost hundreds of millions of pounds to build.

The British government has also provided almost 0.5 million of funding for the project which could create around 130 permanent jobs.

British Airways and Shell will also purchase the biofuel produced, which emits around 70% less greenhouse gases compared with the fossil fuel equivalent, Velocys said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/from-bin-bags-to-planes-shell-ba-plan-eus-first-wastetojet-fuel-plant-1945713,0.023,0.944,0.033,0.5267

(Reuters) - Sharp rises in oil company shares drove Britain's FTSE 100 higher on Monday, after an attack on a Saudi oil facility by Yemeni separatists pushed crude prices higher, while Asia-exposed banks gained following moves by China to keep business interest rates low.

By 0759 GMT, the FTSE 100 ( ) had jumped nearly 1%, its biggest one-day rise in more than 10 days, and the FTSE 250 midcap index ( ) was 0.6% higher, marking a solid start to the week after struggling for three consecutive weeks.

Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) rose about 1% each, tracking a surge in crude prices following a drone attack by Yemen's Houthi group on an oilfield in eastern Saudi Arabia on Saturday, which caused a fire at a gas plant and added to Middle East tensions.

Miners ( ) and Asia-exposed financial heavyweights, led by a near 2% rise in HSBC (L: ) shares, also gained after China's central bank announced reforms to help lower borrowing costs for companies and support an economy bruised by the trade war with the United States.

Meanwhile, UK-centric Lloyds (L: ) and Barclays (L: ) advanced after a report last week that Germany would be prepared to take on new debt to counter a possible recession.

Ocado (L: ) added 2.6%, topping the blue-chip index, after JP Morgan nudged its price target on the stock higher and said the online grocery chain operates ""a superior economic model"" than its store-based rivals.

Peer Sainsbury's (L: ) rose 2.3%. The company said on Saturday, following a media report, that it was not talking to internal candidates about CEO succession plans.

Smallcap outsourcer Mitie (L: ) added 3.3% after a deal to sell its catering and hospitality business to CH&CO as it pushes ahead with moves to simplify operations.

CYBG (L: ) jumped 5.3% to top gainers on the FTSE 250 index, with a trader citing a UBS upgrade on stock.

A rocky road for Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) shareholders in 2019 has really come to a head in recent sessions, spurred by a quite disastrous trading update at the top of the month and energy prices falling to their cheapest since January.

The oily lost 10% in value in the following fortnight, and despite rising from recent lows, buyer interest has been really quite modest, reflecting that recent slide in values to below $60 per barrel and the prospect of this sharp slide extending into 2020.

Prices in freefall It’s quite possible that the diplomatic and military conflict between Iran and the US could really blow up in the months ahead, providing oil prices — and with them the share values of producers like Shell — with the kind of boost that we saw in the spring.

All things considered, though, the odds are stacked firmly against the oil drillers. The probability of frosty US-Chinese trade talks seeping into 2020 spell disaster for a global economy already in the throes of a slowdown, and with it the profits outlook for the likes of Shell in the medium term, at least as energy demand slumps.

Latest news surrounding the International Energy Agency certainly provides plenty more to worry about. The body hacked back its demand estimates through to the end of next year following reports that worldwide oil demand grew at its slowest rate since 2008 between January and May. And this is particularly worrying as production from major producers like the US continues to grow, swamping the market with more unwanted material.

That 25% first-half profits drop that Shell announced at the start of the month, a result caused by slumping prices across the business, is unlikely to be the last awful update to come from the firm as the supply/demand situation worsens.

So just how low could the share price go next year? Well, Shell shed almost 50% of its value in the 18 months from June 2014, a period in which Brent values slipped from $115 per barrel to below $30. It’s time to fear the worst, I think.

A better investment tactic for 2020? The clouds might be swirling for Shell but not all commodity markets look set to sink in 2020. Indeed, with the global economy sinking and increasingly dovish central bank policy fanning inflationary concerns, the most obvious resource to get exposure to now and in the months ahead is gold.

City analysts had been cautiously optimistic over metal prices in the medium term, but they’ve gone positively giddy more recently. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) was the latest to jack its forecasts up late last week, predicting $1,575 per ounce within three months (up from $1,530 at present) and $1,600 inside the next six.

There are many London stocks with which to play the precious metal, though dividend chasers might be most interested in Centamin. Its 3.7% forward yield makes it one of the biggest payers among the gold-diggers right now. And with profits expected to detonate through the next couple of years on the back of a bright commodity price and booming production levels, dividends are expected to rocket as well (resulting in a giant 5% yield for next year).

So forget about Shell, I say, and its 6.4% yield for 2019. I reckon Centamin’s a much safer income share for tough times like these.

Do you know how long it will take for the value of your investments to double?

Of course, no one can provide a guaranteed answer to this question. But if you own assets that provide stable returns each year, then you can make a useful estimate.

If you’re aiming to retire rich, I’d suggest this should be an important part of your retirement planning.

In this article, I’ll explain how you can use this simple rule to estimate future gains.

The rule of 72 The rule of 72 is a simple way to work out how long an investment will take to double in value, based on a fixed rate of interest.

All you do is to divide 72 by the expected annual rate of return. For example, 72/4 tells us that an investment which returns 4% per year should double in 18 years.

Applying the rule of 72 to a few common scenarios gives us some interesting numbers to work with:

Annual rate of return No. of years to double Best buy easy access cash ISA 1.44% 50 Best buy 3 yr fixed-rate ISA 1.9% 39 UK CPI inflation 2.1% 34 UK stock market (average long-term annual return) c.8% c.9

As you can see, even a small change in interest rates makes a big difference to future returns.

I hope you can also see that saving money in cash means that the value of your money will fall, after inflation. This is why trying to saving for retirement in cash is so hopeless.

One more example You may think I’m exaggerating the importance of inflation. I don’t think I am. When I started my first proper job, I remember paying less than 70p per litre for petrol and under £2 per pint for beer.

Today I’m paying double those figures. The rule of 72 tells me that inflation on beer and petrol has averaged about 3.6% since I started work.

If you want your savings to help you get rich and retire comfortably, then you need to be earnings positive returns after inflation.

Investing to beat inflation If you’ve got 20 years or more until retirement, I would suggest that the simplest and safest way to build a worthwhile fund is to put as much as you can each month into a tracker fund (inside a tax-free Stocks and Shares ISA).

According to research by Barclays (LON: ), the long-term average return from the UK stock market is about 8% per year. At that rate, it could take just nine years to double your money.

In reality, it will probably take a bit longer than this as stock market returns tend to come in cycles. But over long periods, history suggests the stock market is one of the best ways to build wealth.

Invest in dividend stocks Rather than putting your money into a tracker fund, you might prefer to invest your cash in individual dividend stocks. This can be a surprisingly good way to generate reliable returns.

Income picks on my radar include companies like Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (6.4%), WPP (LON: ) (6.1%) and GlaxoSmithKline (4.8%).

The rule of 72 tells us that a dividend yield of 6% will double your investment in 12 years, assuming the shares stay flat and you reinvest the dividend income.

I hope I’ve shown how the rule of 72 is a powerful tool for financial planning. If you’re looking for more investment ideas, read on.

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 rose on Wednesday as oil majors tracked gains in crude prices and a weaker pound led exporter stocks higher, while cautious investors awaited minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's July meeting for signs of further policy easing.

The main index ( ) added 0.8%, with a boost from Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) helping the index recover most of the previous session's losses. The mid-cap gained 0.5% by 0757 GMT.

BAT (L: ) and other stocks that book a major chunk of their earnings in dollars gained as the pound drifted lower again, ahead of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

After the European Union rebuffed Johnson's demand to reopen the Brexit divorce deal on Tuesday, investors are looking for fresh signals that Europe would be willing to re-negotiate and help Britain stave off a disorderly exit from the bloc.

More broadly, traders have pinned their hopes on the U.S. Fed and other central banks lowering interest rates in the near-term to cushion blows from a bruising U.S.-China trade war and quell fears of an impending recession.

Such uncertainties have driven away investors from risky assets such as equities in recent weeks, putting the FTSE on course for its worst month in four years and making the Fed's minutes all the more crucial.

""There is likely to be interest as to whether there was any discussion about whether a cut was even necessary, or more importantly whether an even bigger cut of 50 bps was discussed,"" CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said.

""The tone of the discussions will also give a steer as to whether markets are right to expect another move in September.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) is launching electric vehicle chargers at petrol stations in Singapore, its first such foray in Southeast Asia, the company said on Monday.

The electric vehicle charging service, 'Shell Recharge', will be available at 10 Shell petrol stations in Singapore by October, this year or about 20% of its retail network in the city-state, the company said in a statement.

It added that the chargers typically provide from 0% to 80% charge in about 30 minutes, and are compatible with most electric vehicles in Singapore.

HOUSTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States last week imposed a sweeping freeze on Venezuelan government assets in U.S. territory and threatened to sanction any company that works with socialist President Nicolas Maduro's government, as the Trump administration ratcheted up its bid to force Maduro out.

In January the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela's most important global business - producing and selling , which accounts for more than 95 percent of the country's export revenue. U.S. refineries had been Venezuela's top customer, and output has fallen by some 40 percent since then.

The United States and many Western governments have recognised Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country's rightful head of state.

Oil industry sources warned that if Washington follows through on its threat to sanction non-U.S. companies that do business with state oil company PDVSA, production could collapse further - increasing the squeeze on Maduro.

HOW MUCH OIL IS VENEZUELA CURRENTLY PRODUCING?

Venezuela's crude production was between 734,000 and 1.05 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, according to secondary sources and self-reported figures quoted by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in its July oil market report. That compared to output of 3 million bpd at the turn of the century.

HOW MUCH CRUDE AND REFINED PRODUCTS IS IT EXPORTING?

Venezuela exported nearly 933,000 bpd of crude and refined products in July, down 17.5% from June, according to data from PDVSA and Refinitiv Eikon. Exports sank 40% in February, the first full month after the sanctions were imposed.

WHERE IS THAT OIL GOING?

The United States, India and China were Venezuela's biggest customers prior to sanctions, with the United States the biggest cash buyer.

India and China have accounted for most of Venezuela's crude exports since sanctions took effect. Russia's state-run energy company Rosneft (MM: ) took more than 46% of the country's shipments in July with some 432,000 bpd of crude resold to final customers in Asia.

HOW DO U.S. SANCTIONS AFFECT THE SECTOR?

The January sanctions prevented U.S. companies from dealing with PDVSA, and a clause that became effective in April blocked PDVSA from operating in the U.S. financial system.

The asset freeze announced in early August threatens sanctions against any company deemed by Washington to be ""materially assisting"" Venezuela's government.

While the January sanctions included similar language, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton last week said the new round gave companies a choice between doing business with Maduro or the United States. That has spooked PDVSA's joint venture partners and customers, who are seeking clarity on the measure, sources said.

WHAT ABOUT U.S. IMPORTS?

U.S. imports of Venezuelan crude have collapsed to zero in the wake of sanctions. In the week ended Jan. 25, just before sanctions were announced, U.S. refineries imported 587,000 bpd.

WHY IS VENEZUELAN CRUDE SO IMPORTANT?

Heavy crude supplies of the kind Venezuela pumps are constrained worldwide. Large producers, such as Canada and Mexico, are unable to lift exports to replace the lost barrels, and smaller producers, including Colombia and Ecuador, simply do not pump enough to ease the global shortfall.

Complex U.S. Gulf Coast refiners use heavy crude as part of a mix to create high-margin distillate products.

WHO WERE THE BIGGEST U.S. CUSTOMERS?

U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum, a subsidiary of PDVSA, imported more than 175,800 bpd of Venezuelan oil in 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon.

It was followed by Valero Energy Corp (N: ), which imported about 166,000 bpd last year, and oil major Chevron Corp (N: ), with about 83,000 bpd.

WHERE ARE U.S. REFINERS FINDING REPLACEMENT BARRELS?

Chevron, Valero and Citgo have turned to producers of heavy crude in Colombia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Canada, as well as sour grades produced in the U.S. Gulf Coast by BP PLC (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L: ), traders and brokers said.

Valero has said it has used domestic blends, Canadian crude and a mix of other grades, including crude from Brazil. The U.S. refiners have also secured more crude from West Africa as a replacement, traders said.

WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO REPAIR THE VENEZUELAN OIL INDUSTRY?

Venezuela might open its oil industry to foreign investment and limit the role of PDVSA, which currently controls all joint ventures in the OPEC-member nation, said Ricardo Hausmann, Guaido's representative before the Inter-American Development Bank.

WHAT ELSE IS VENEZUELA EXPORTING?

Venezuela has stepped up shipments of gold to other countries, sending more than $900 million to Turkey in 2018, according to Turkish government data and trade reports.

Caracas is using some proceeds from those sales to buy Turkish consumer goods, according to opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni. Turkish pasta and powdered milk are now staples in Maduro's subsidised food programme. Trade between the two nations grew eightfold last year.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/explainer-us-sanctions-and-venezuelas-trade-and-oil-industry-partners-1942291,0.088,0.851,0.061,-0.9857

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 tumbled to a six-month low as China's warning to counter the latest U.S. tariffs fanned trade tensions, while the more domestically focussed midcap index fared better in comparison, amid investors' hopes of averting a no-deal Brexit.

The FTSE 100 index ( ) shed 1.1%, lagging its European peers, with losses led by oil majors and financial stocks.

Shell (L: ), the largest company on the index by market value, was the biggest drag with a 3.2% drop as the stock traded ex-dividend, while crude prices also fell. [O/R]

While the FTSE 250 index ( ) earlier hit a near seven-month low, the index clawed back some of the early losses to close 0.5% lower on the back of a rise in sterling.

Gains for the local currency was brought on by news that the opposition Labour Party was mounting a bid to bring down Prime Minister Boris Johnson and stop him taking Britain out of the EU without a deal.

However, global trade tensions were very much in play after China vowed retaliation against the latest U.S. tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods. The fears were briefly kept in check earlier in the week when the Trump administration delayed tariffs on some of the goods.

China's reaction on Thursday dragged an index of miners ( ) down 2% to its lowest since January over concerns about global demand amid the painful trade war.

Blue-chip stocks trading ex-dividend, such as HSBC (L: ) and pension buyout specialist Phoenix Group (L: ) also weighed on the index, while fears of a recession persisted with the Gilt yield curve remaining inverted on Thursday.

""That (drop in financial stocks) isn't a surprise given the compression in the UK government bond yields, and bank's profitability is usually hit in lower interest rate environments,"" CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.

Both UK indexes had incurred steep losses in the previous session as investors rushed to dump risky assets after the 10-year bond yields fell below two-year equivalents for the first time since the financial crisis.

If losses hold, the FTSE 100 would suffer its biggest monthly fall in more than seven years.

COPENHAGEN/MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian-led gas pipeline project across the Baltic Sea to Europe could be delayed by up to eight months and cost an extra 660 million euros ($740 million) due to hurdles in securing the necessary permits from Denmark, the pipeline operator has said.

The 1,230-km (765-mile) Nord Stream 2 pipeline, now under construction, has come under fire from the United States and several eastern European, Nordic and Baltic countries, which say the conduit will increase Europe's reliance on Russian gas.

The timeline of the project, led by state-owned Gazprom (MM: ), is key for the future of the gas transit contract between Moscow and Kiev, as Ukraine is Russia's main gas route for exports to Europe.

The transit contract, a large source of budget revenue for Ukraine, expires at the end of this year. Nord Stream 2, according to its initial schedule, should have been ready by then.

Gazprom has completed more than 70% of Nord Stream 2 but since April 2017 has had pending applications with Danish authorities to lay between 147 and 175 km via Danish waters.

Nord Stream 2, aimed at doubling the annual capacity of the existing Nord Stream pipeline by adding 55 billion cubic metres, is to run via the waters of Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany. It has approvals from all countries whose waters it crosses apart from Denmark.

The Russian-led company submitted two route applications with the Danish authorities, of which the first was proposed more than two years ago. In March, the Danish Energy Agency requested an environmental assessment of a third route option.

Nord Stream 2 labelled the third route request ""a deliberate attempt to delay the project's completion"".

Nord Stream 2, in a complaint to the Danish authorities in April, said costs related to the new request for a third route had already totalled more than 100 million euros.

According to the letter, obtained by Reuters, the request for a third route could result in a delay of up to eight months and further costs of 560 million euros. The initial budget was 9.5 billion euros.

""Delaying the project will result in a significant financial loss for Nord Stream 2,"" the letter said, asking the Danish Energy Board of Appeal to nix the energy agency's request.

Nord Stream 2 said in the letter that it had ""repeatedly asked for a status update ... without receiving any response"".

Aside from Gazprom, half of the funding for Nord Stream 2 is being provided by Germany's Uniper (DE: ) and BASF's (DE: ) Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch company Shell (L: ), Austria's OMV (VI: ) and France's Engie (PA: ).

Reuters obtained the document from the Danish Energy Board of Appeal under laws on freedom of information.

The Danish Energy Agency confirmed that Nord Stream 2 had appealed its decision. The agency said it has made its reasons for requesting a third route application clear to the appeal board but declined to elaborate.

NO MORE VETO

Nord Stream 2 told Reuters it had informed the Danish Energy Agency about the potential impact of delays on costs and the project schedule, but declined to confirm the figures contained in the letter.

""A delay of several months will lead to additional costs of several hundred million euros but we cannot fully quantify because the final impacts depend on the timing of the permit decision of the responsible authorities,"" it said.

In June, Nord Stream 2 withdrew its initial 2017 application for a route through Danish territorial waters south of the Baltic island of Bornholm.

Denmark could have vetoed the initial route. The country passed a law in 2017 that would allow it to ban the pipeline from passing through its territorial waters on security grounds.

However, no veto can be applied for the two remaining route options as they would steer the pipeline through Denmark's exclusive economic zone, not its territorial waters.

According to Reuters calculations based on Nord Stream 2 data and the speed of construction, Gazprom's pipe-layers will reach the Danish exclusive economic zone between three and five months from now.

Nord Stream 2 said in May the project may be launched in 2020 rather than the end of 2019 due to delays in obtaining permits from Denmark.

Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said last month that Moscow had offered Kiev a short-term gas transit deal to substitute the current 10-year contract after it ends this year.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusive-denmarks-nord-stream-2-route-request-could-cause-eightmonth-delay-cost-660-million-euros--operator-1937417,0.035,0.903,0.062,0.9464

LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (N: ) is considering a sale of its assets in the British North Sea after more than 50 years in the oil and gas basin as it focuses on U.S. shale production and new projects.

The world's largest publicly traded energy company has held talks with a number of North Sea operators in recent weeks to gauge interest in some or all of its assets, which could fetch up to $2 billion, according to three industry sources with knowledge of the matter.

Exxon declined to comment.

Leaving the British North Sea would mark a major retreat from Europe for Irving, Texas-headquartered Exxon, which has already put its Norwegian offshore assets on the block.

It would follow similar moves by U.S. rivals Chevron (NYSE: ) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: ) which earlier this year sold the bulk of their North Sea operations.

Most of Exxon's operations are managed through a 50-50 joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), known as Esso Exploration and Production UK, and include interests in nearly 40 oil and gas fields.

Shell declined to comment.

Exxon produces around 80,000 barrels of oil and 441 million cubic feet of gas a day in the British North Sea, according to its website.

Potential buyers could include large private equity-backed North Sea producers such as Chrysaor or Neptune which have acquired portfolios from veteran producers in recent years.

Assigning a value to oil and gas assets in the North Sea is complicated because many fields and infrastructure are nearing the end of their lives and require dismantling, or decommissioning, an expensive process which can offset years of production revenue.

Neivan Boroujerdi, North Sea analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said an Exxon exit was expected, valuing it at around $2 billion.

“Combined with its Norwegian assets, which ExxonMobil recently announced its intention to market, could see the supermajor reach one-third of the way to meeting its $15 billion divestment target,"" Boroujerdi said.

Exxon’s UK business “is attractive. It is highly cash generative, with operating costs around half of the UK average.”

The North Sea has seen a revival in production in recent years due to new fields coming on line and improved performance by operators following the 2014 oil price collapse.

Still, the basin's production is expected to decline over the next decade, according to the UK Oil and Gas Authority.

Should the direct discussions with potential buyers not yield a result, Exxon will consider appointing an external bank to run a formal sale process, two of the sources added.

It was unclear if a sale of assets would require breaking up the Esso joint venture.

Esso has been producing gas since 1968 and oil since 1976, including from the field, which is eponymous with the global crude benchmark and is now being decommissioned.

Exxon's operational focal point in recent years has turned to the United States, where it is rapidly ramping up oil production in the Permian Basin, as well as in Guyana, where it is developing huge, untapped fields.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusive-exxon-eyes-uk-north-sea-exit-after-50year-presence--sources-1940615,0.021,0.902,0.077,0.9638

Global stock markets are in turmoil, the has lost 6.6% so far in August, and there’s growing talk of a looming recession.

From the US, we’re hearing stories of an inverted yield curve, which means that yields on shorter-term bonds exceed those on longer-term bonds. It’s something that’s often seen as a recession indicator, and it happened Wednesday, when the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds dipped below the two-year yield for the first time since the banking crisis.

Economics We have an escalating trade war between Donald Trump and China, Brexit here in the UK, news of economic shrinkage from EU powerhouse Germany… even the price of oil has slipped back below $60 per barrel. Investors are getting twitchy and selling up, but I say they’re wrong to do so.

There’s no doubt that the banking crunch caused a lot of pain, including the end of cheap borrowing, plus job losses, weaker pay deals and a dip in a lot of people’s spending power that hit high street shops hard. But you know what, the FTSE 100 is now well ahead of its peak from before the crunch, most shares have recovered their short-term losses and then some, and it provided a brilliant buying period for investors.

Economic instability might terrify the big institutional investors, but we private investors can use it to pick up some very nice bargains to top up our investment plans.

Winners If you’d managed to buy Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) shares at the depth of the stock market in February 2009, you’d be sitting on a 52% gain now (even though we’ve been through an oil price crisis in the meantime) and you’d have come close to doubling that when dividends are added.

If you’d invested in a stock considered super safe, Unilever (LON: ), you’d have more than trebled your money. And AstraZeneca, recovering from its troubles over the loss of some key patents and reinvesting heavily in its development pipeline would have trebled your cash too. And you’d even have won with most of the banks themselves, with Royal Bank of Scotland (LON: ) the only loser. Even troubled Lloyds is up 28% (and has been paying decent dividends).

In fact, the FTSE 100 is up 85% since the crash, and its dividend yields have been growing. The index’s forecast yield for 2019 now stands at 4.5%, and you should be able to do better than that if you pick only high-dividend stocks and ignore zero and low-dividend ones.

Strategy Right now I have some cash in my SIPP, and I’m holding back on it and identifying big-dividend stocks that I think will become even cheaper.

Taylor Wimpey (LON: ) shares are on a predicted dividend yield of 12%, SSE (LON: ) is on 7.5%, Standard Life (LON: ) Aberdeen is offering 8.7%, and there are many more big ones. These are all forecast yields and are not guaranteed, but they’re a decent guide to the income to be had from Footsie shares.

The key thing is to keep cool, remember that investing in shares is a long-term thing and should be done with a horizon of at least 10 years, and don’t follow the institutional investors who focus on their short-term, quarter-by-quarter, results. There could be some great buys coming our way.

ZURICH (Reuters) - ABB (S: ) shares jumped almost 4% in early Monday trading as investors welcomed news the Swiss engineering group had poached Bjorn Rosengren from Swedish mining equipment firm Sandvik (ST: ) to be its next chief executive.

Rosengren will take over at the Zurich-based maker of industrial drives and robots in March, the company said on Sunday.

ABB, whose previous CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer left suddenly in April, is in the middle of overhauling its business following years of lacklustre profit and bungled acquisitions.

Chairman Peter Voser, who has taken on CEO functions on an interim basis, said on Monday he was confident he had got the right man.

""As my successor as CEO, Bjorn Rosengren is the ideal candidate to take ABB forward, together with our strong team on the Executive Committee. He understands how to empower people to perform and create long-term value,"" Voser said in a tweet.

During his four years at Sandvik, Rosengren decentralised the operations of the metal-cutting tools and mining gear maker and sold off underperforming businesses.

ABB, whose shares have lost 14% of their value over the last five years, is selling its power grids business to Hitachi and last month announced a deal to quit the solar energy inverters business.

Voser, a former CEO of oil major Shell (L: ), has launched a review of businesses which generate $3 billion (£2.49 billion) of revenue, or 11% of ABB's total, which could be improved or sold.

""With the appointment of Rosengren, ABB will have a CEO with a proven track record and a strong reputation in the capital markets for delivering operational improvement,"" said Bank of America (NYSE: ) Merrill Lynch analyst Alexander Virgo.

""In our view, his success at Sandvik in implementing a decentralised business model should make him a good match for ABB, which is seeking to make a fundamental shift in corporate culture following the sale of Power Grids.""

ABB's largest shareholder Investor AB (ST: ) also welcomed the appointment of Rosengren, who before Sandvik was CEO of Wartsila (HE: ), which makes and services power sources for the marine and energy markets.

""From his previous leading roles in several companies, he has a proven track record in driving a decentralised culture, improving performance and delivering value,"" said Johan Forssell, CEO of Investor, which holds 11.2% of ABB.

Activist investor Cevian Capital, ABB's second biggest shareholder with a 5.3% stake, said Rosengren was an ""excellent choice"" and ABB shares could almost double in value if he could lift margins and valuations to match rivals.

""If these gaps are closed, ABB should be worth more than 35 CHF (Swiss francs). That is Bjorn's main task,"" said Cevian managing partner Christer Gardell in an emailed statement.

At 0745 GMT, ABB shares were up 3.9% at 18.21 francs",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/rosengren-is-ideal-candidate-to-transform-abb-says-chairman-1939593,0.004,0.884,0.112,0.9946

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish engineering group Sandvik's (ST: ) Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Rosengren will step down next year and will join Swiss-Swedish robotics and engineering group ABB Ltd (S: ) as CEO, the companies said in separate statements on Sunday.

Rosengren, who has a reputation for being ruthless with underperforming divisions, will join ABB in February next year, ABB said.

He will take over from acting ABB CEO Peter Voser in March, with Voser reverting to his position as chairman of the board at ABB, according to the company's statement.

Voser took over temporarily as head of ABB after Ulrich Spiesshofer left suddenly in April.

Businesses which generate $3 billion of revenue, 11% of ABB's total annual sales, are now under review and could be sold off or closed down, Voser told Reuters in a recent interview.

Voser, the former Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) CEO, who is also ABB's chairman, has pledged a turnaround after years of unsatisfactory performance. ABB shares have fallen nearly 20% in the last five years.

""Bjorn Rosengren has, since he joined Sandvik in November 2015, established a solid decentralized business model for the company and made the organisation more flexible and efficient,"" Sandvik said in a statement, adding it would initiate the work to appoint a new President and CEO on Monday.

Rosengren, 60, has also held several positions in Sandvik peer Atlas Copco and was the CEO of Finnish engineering group Wartsila between 2011–2015.

Sandvik, maker of metal-cutting tools and mining gear, said last month it would cut around 2,000 jobs to buttress profitability in the face of early signs of slowing market demand.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/sandvik-chief-executive-rosengren-to-step-down-and-join-abb-as-ceo-1939525,0.019,0.934,0.047,0.7645

If you’re looking for defensive income, in my opinion Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) is one of the best stocks you can buy.

One of the UK’s top blue-chip stocks, this company has been paying an income out to investors since World War Two. It doesn’t look as if this track record is going to come to an end any time soon.

A market leader Shell dominates the oil & gas trading markets across Europe, which gives it a dependable income stream. On top of this, the company is one of the world’s largest hydrocarbon producers. It’s also investing billions of dollars every year to build out its renewable energy business. I think these efforts will help Shell maintain its position as one of the world’s leading energy businesses for decades to come.

However, the one drawback of investing in Shell is its size. City analysts commonly use the phrase “elephants don’t run” when describing Shell and its growth prospects due to the firm’s size. The bigger companies become, the harder it is for them to grow.

Shell’s no exception. Analysts are only forecasting earnings growth of 9% this year, followed by 15% for 2020, although these numbers are entirely dependant on the price of oil.

But what the firm lacks in growth, it more than makes up for in income. Shares in the company currently support a dividend yield of 6.5% — one of the highest yields in the .

Considering Shell’s downbeat growth outlook, if you’re looking for capital growth, then I highly recommend combining Shell with a smaller growth stock in your portfolio. I think Tullow Oil (LON: ) (LSE: TLW) could be a great pick here.

After a rough few years, the business is now back on track and analysts have earnings rising from $85m in 2018 to $360m by 2020. On top of this, the firm recently re-instated its dividend and is making good headway reducing debt. Net debt declined by around $400m in 2018 and looks set to fall further for 2019.

A new discovery Tullow is one of the most active oil explorers in Africa and its track record of finding and drilling for oil is exceptional. Management is now trying to diversify the group internationally. Its newest prospect is the closely-watched Jethro-1 well in the Orinduik block in Guyana.

Initial drilling results indicate this prospect could hold over 100m barrels of oil, above expectations. Following these findings, Tullow chief executive Paul McDade told Reuters: “It looks like we have a long-term business in Guyana.” So it would appear Tullow wants to develop this prospect as soon as possible.

Developments like the Orinduik block is why I think Tullow could be a great place to invest your money alongside Shell. Tullow’s production growth should provide capital gains while Shell continues to chuck off a steady income. This combination of income and growth could help your portfolio charge ahead.

NEW DELHI/LONDON (Reuters) - Global oil major BP (L: ) is deepening its ties with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries (NS: ) by forging a fuel retailing joint venture to capitalise on rising demand in Asia's third-biggest economy.

The move comes days after BP said it would build a network of charging hubs for electric vehicles with China's Didi Chuxing, betting on the world's largest market for such cars.

BP will own a 49% stake in its new Indian joint venture, with the rest held by Reliance, operator of the world's biggest refining complex. The companies did not disclose financial details of the deal.

In 2011 BP acquired a 30% stake from Reliance in some of its exploration blocks and formed a gas sourcing and marketing tie-up. In 2017 the two companies signed agreements to explore options to work together to develop alternative fuels and mobility businesses.

The new venture will take over Reliance's 1,400-plus retail fuel stations and its aviation fuel business spread across 30 Indian airports. The plan is to expand its retail fuel network to up to 5,500 sites over five years.

Foreign oil majors including Saudi Aramco and France's Total (PA: ) are trying to secure a foothold in India, which is challenging China as the driver of global oil demand.

The International Energy Agency expects the South Asian nation to account for a quarter of global energy use by 2040.

In a joint statement announcing the tie-up, the British company's chief executive, Bob Dudley, said India is set to be the world's largest growth market for energy by the mid-2020s.

So far European oil major Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and Russia's Rosneft (MM: ), through its Nayara Energy business, are the only foreign players in India's retail fuel network.

Reliance and BP hope to conclude final agreements by the end of December and close the transaction by June 2020.

BP, which operates gas stations and convenience stores across 18 countries with more than 18,700 sites, had previously obtained permission from the federal oil ministry to enter India's fuel marketing and aviation business on its own.

However, Dudley told the CNBC-TV18 news channel it didn't feel right for BP to establish an Indian retail fuel business on it own.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/bp-to-enter-indias-fuel-retail-market-with-reliance-tieup-1935369,0.011,0.927,0.061,0.9545

By Alex Lawler, Marwa Rashad and Saeed Azhar

LONDON/RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is insisting on a $2 trillion (£1.65 trillion) valuation of oil firm Aramco, even though some bankers and company insiders say the kingdom should trim its target to around $1.5 trillion, industry and banking sources said.

With Aramco talking again to banks about an initial public offering (IPO), its board is meeting later this week and will probably hold a discussion about the company's value, a source close to the company said.

Saudi Aramco declined to comment. CIC, the Saudi government media office, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Prince Mohammed put a $2 trillion valuation on the state company in early 2016 when he first proposed a share sale to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy beyond oil.

He has stuck with that valuation, according to the source close to Aramco and another source familiar with the IPO plans, even though some banks think it will be a struggle. Over the past three years, countries have accelerated efforts to shift away from fossil fuels to curb global warming, putting oil prices under pressure.

A valuation gap could hinder any share sale.

""If the market didn't value Aramco properly, there is no rush to IPO, they can always postpone,"" the source familiar with the plans said.

""They have the right tools to manoeuvre and aren't in a weak position to IPO Aramco unless with a valuation that achieves the objectives of the vision and the national interest.""

Even at the lower end of estimated valuations, an Aramco IPO would create the world's largest public company. It would also bring unprecedented scrutiny on the kingdom. Months after the listing was shelved, Saudi Arabia came under Western pressure over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

The initial plan to sell a 5 percent stake in Aramco was meant to raise funds for Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund to invest in non-oil sectors. When the IPO was shelved, the wealth fund sold a majority stake in petrochemicals company Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) to Aramco for $69 billion instead.

After the SABIC acquisition was announced, Saudi Aramco issued its first international bonds in April. The success of that debt sale, which attracted more than $100 billion in orders for a $12 billion issue, showed that pressure on the kingdom over the Khashoggi killing had subsided. Talks about a share sale were revived shortly after.

OIL PRICES

This year's bond sale forced Aramco to disclose its financials, revealing a colossal net income of $111 billion, over a third bigger than the combined net income of the five super majors Exxon Mobil (N: ), Royal Dutch/Shell (AS: ), BP (L: ), Chevron (N: ) and Total (PA: ).

Even with such profits, one bank pitching for a role in a renewed listing plan has put Aramco's value at $1.4-$1.5 trillion including SABIC, a source familiar with the matter said. The source close to Aramco described that as a more realistic valuation.

Oil and gas companies are struggling to attract investor interest due to a weaker outlook for oil and deepening climate activism. The S&P Energy sector ( ) is up 2 percent so far this year, underperforming the broader market ( ) which is 15 percent higher.

Even at $1.5 trillion, Aramco would be worth at least 50 percent more than the world's most valuable companies - Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) with around $1 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) at around $900 billion each.

A key factor in an oil company's value is the expected oil price. Producers including Saudi Arabia, its OPEC colleagues and non-members like Russia have struggled to prop up the market this year by a supply-limiting pact, due to slowing demand and rising supplies from the United States and other producers.

Brent crude ( ) is trading at $59 a barrel, down from the $70-$80 that OPEC and industry sources have said Saudi Arabia favours.

""If you are absolutely sure of a high oil price it's easier to have a high valuation, but prices are not that high and a very high oil price is not sustainable,"" said the source close to Aramco.

""Also, a lot depends on the integration of SABIC and how convincing that story is.""

Before the IPO was put on hold, banks estimated Aramco's value at $1.3 to $1.7 trillion, the source close to Aramco said.

Another person, a source with an international bank, said banks' estimates at that time were around $1.5 trillion with $1.7 trillion at the top.

Saudi Aramco pumps about one in every 10 barrels of oil produced in the world and sees the downstream - oil refining and petrochemicals - as increasingly important to boost the profit it makes on each barrel. With the purchase of SABIC, it aims to become a global leader in chemicals, helping to diversify its revenues.

The source with the international bank said efforts remained focused on achieving the $2 trillion value, and a second source close to Aramco said the company has been working on ways to boost its own value independently of the oil price.

""They are looking at things like internal governance and how to extract value,"" this second source said. ""If they structure the SABIC integration properly, it will increase the value of the company.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/exclusive-saudi-aramco-valuation-gap-persists-as-ipo-talks-resume--sources-1936156,0.03,0.874,0.096,0.9949

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (N: ) reported a 21% drop in quarterly profit on Friday, hit by weaker prices, lower refining profits and a loss in its U.S. chemicals business.

The largest U.S. oil producer's net income fell to $3.13 billion (£2.59 billion), or 73 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $3.95 billion, or 92 cents per share, last year.

Analysts had expected Exxon to report earnings of 66 cents per share, according to data from Refinitiv. Analysts sharply lowered their expectations after the company disclosed weaker results last month, and had expected Exxon to earn 97 cents a share early in July.

Exxon's oil equivalent production rose 7% to 3.9 million barrels per day, boosted by output in the top U.S. shale field. Exxon's Permian Basin production was up 90% from the previous year, the company said.

Exxon’s weaker results mirrored those at rivals Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), Equinor (OL: ) and Total SA (PA: ). Shell posted its smallest profit in 30 months on weaker margins in chemicals, a loss in refining and tumbling natural gas prices. Total also cited weaker natural gas and refining operations for earnings that fell 19% from a year ago, while Equinor’s profit fell 27% on weaker oil and gas prices.

Exxon boosted its estimated recoverable reserves in its offshore Guyana project to more than 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent, from 5.5 billion barrels.

By Nidhi Verma

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is set to relax rules for setting up fuel stations after almost two decades, in a move expected to allow companies like Saudi Aramco, Total (PA: ) and Trafigura to gain a foothold in a sector dominated by state-run entities.

The new rules - suggested by an expert panel - mirror those in developed nations like the United States and Britain, and would allow convenience stores, shopping malls and hypermarkets to sell fuels if they are eligible, said an oil ministry source.

The government panel has recommended allowing marketing rights for sale of gasoil, gasoline and aviation fuel to companies with a net worth of 2.5 billion rupees.

India, where fuel demand is expected to rise in the coming years, has turned into a lucrative market after the government removed controls on retail pricing of gasoline and gasoil.

Global players, however, faced difficulties in getting a foothold as they need to commit investment of 20 billion rupees (£232.16 million) in India's oil and gas sector to get fuel marketing rights.

The cabinet is expected to approve the proposal in four to six weeks, said the source, who declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak to media.

India's oil ministry did not respond to an email seeking comment.

DIFFICULT TO SURVIVE

India has emerged as a key driver of global oil demand. The International Energy Agency expects the South Asian nation to account for a quarter of global energy use by 2040.

Companies including Reliance Industries (NS: ), RoyalDutch Shell (L: ) and Nayara Energy, part owned by Russian oil major Rosneft (MM: ) account for about 10% of the 64,625 fuel stations in the country, according to data posted on the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.

""For a new player it is very difficult to survive as the most of the ROs (retail outlets) are owned by state-run companies. We want to provide enabling environment to have greater competition,"" said the source.

The new rules will help trader Trafigura's downstream arm Puma Energy, which had applied for a license last year to sell auto fuels in India.

Subsidiaries and joint ventures of companies with existing fuel retailing licenses need to apply again for the marketing rights, according to the panel's suggestions.

This would mean the joint venture of Reliance Industries (NS: ) and BP (L: ) announced on Tuesday will need a license from the government to start fuel retailing in the country.

The new rules would also allow companies to directly sell fuel to industries without setting up retail fuel stations.

Companies must set up 5% of proposed retails outlets in rural areas within seven months of winning authorisation, the panel recommends.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/india-to-relax-rules-for-entry-into-fuel-retail-sector--source-1935910,0.022,0.886,0.091,0.9812

By Jessica Jaganathan

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) is considering to install solar panels to power its Bukom refining site in Singapore, a company spokeswoman told Reuters on Tuesday.

""We are exploring the potential of installing solar panels at our Pulau Bukom Manufacturing Site,"" she said, without providing further details.

The Bukom manufacturing site includes a 500,000 barrels-per-day refinery, which is Shell's largest wholly owned refinery.

The oil and gas company has been exploring solar installations for its other sites in Singapore as part of its plans to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon footprint.

Globally, Shell is installing solar photovoltaic panels on the roofs of seven lubricant plants in China, India, Italy, Singapore and Switzerland.

It has so far identified three manufacturing and logistics sites in Singapore's western regions of Tuas, Jurong Island and Pandan to install a solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation system, with a combined peak capacity of about three megawatts.

The first and largest of the three Shell solar farms, which will go live next month, will have more than 6,500 panels placed above a lubricant plant in Tuas. The solar farm is expected to produce about 3,300 megawatt hours of renewable energy every year.

The generated solar energy will be used to help power operations at the Tuas lubricants plant, the company said, adding that this can result in the avoidance of a third of the greenhouse gas emissions from the plant's electricity use which is equivalent to taking about 700 cars off the road for one year.

Installations at Shell's sites in Pandan and Jurong Island are expected to start in late 2019 and early 2020 respectively, the company said.

Shell said as part of its efforts to try low carbon solutions, the company has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Energy Market Authority of Singapore to jointly work on energy storage systems.

""This could include piloting commercially viable business models with innovative solutions that integrate storage systems and solar power to Shell's sites in Singapore,"" Shell said, declining to provide more details citing commercial confidentiality reasons.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/shell-considers-solar-panels-to-power-singapore-refinery-site-1935129,0.013,0.909,0.078,0.9571

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 snapped a six-day losing streak after a topsy-turvy session on Wednesday as investors composed themselves after sell-offs triggered by worries over the U.S.-China trade dispute and a weaker sterling supported exporter stocks.

Though poor earnings for global commodities trader Glencore and a handful of other companies limited gains, the main index ( ) ended 0.4% higher.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) rose 0.5%, helped by a post-earnings jump in Ultra Electronic (L: ) and infrastructure products maker Hill & Smith (L: ).

The FTSE 100 has tumbled more than 5% in just a week, after having gained in six of the first seven months of the year, following President Donald Trump's threat to slap a 10% tariff on a further $300 billion in Chinese imports next month.

It had surged as much as 0.9% on Wednesday, but gave up a lot of those gains as a drop in yields spurred a global rally in safe-haven, fixed income assets and led investors to pile into bonds.

""There is a sense the recent bounce is on shaky grounds,"" CMC Markets analyst David Madden said. ""The equity benchmarks in Europe that are higher, are showing small gains, and it doesn't exactly project an air of confidence.""

In news-driven moves, Glencore (L: ) weighed on the blue-chip index as it fell 2.5% and hit a near three-year low after an almost one-third drop in core profit.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China would take “necessary countermeasures” although she provided no details on the planned response.

Beijing’s reaction comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would place a 10% tariff on a further $300 billion in Chinese goods starting on Sept. 1.

2. Jobs report on tap

The U.S. economy is expected to have churned out than in the previous month, reflecting a cooling the economy under the influence of trade conflicts and the fading of the fiscal stimulus that supported growth in 2018.

Some traders are worried that a stronger report could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further, in the wake of comments from chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week that expressed skepticism about the need for an easier monetary policy.

Analysts commented that recent readings of consumer sentiment were solid, leaving some upside risk to consensus.

4. Exxon and Chevron to report earnings

Oil majors Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) and Chevron (NYSE: ) will be in the spotlight as they report quarterly earnings ahead of the opening bell.

Exxon’s results are likely to be held back by weaker performance in its refining segment after the company flagged narrower margins in its chemical business, a trend already evident in the reports of European majors such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ).

Chevron (NYSE: ) will release its first quarterly numbers since failing in its bid to acquire Anadarko (NYSE: ). Higher output is expected to offset weakness in its downstream business, which includes refining activity.

5. Trump set to make statement on EU trade

Trump’s daily itinerary includes “ ” at 1:45 PM ET (17:45 GMT) although no details of what it would entail were specified.

Bloomberg however cited people familiar with the matter as saying that Trump will formally announce a deal to open up the European Union to more beef exports.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and the European ambassador to the U.S. will then sign the agreement in a formal ceremony that Bloomberg’s sources said was designed to show progress on the bilateral trade agenda.

That would represent a brightening of the tone from recent weeks, in which President Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on French wine in response to a new French tax on digital giants, in addition to repeating older threats of tariffs on European autos.

BP +0.60% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio SHEL +0.41% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

I recently asked whether the UK Oil & Gas (LSE: UKOG) share price is likely to fall all the way to zero. The firm’s financial situation has looked perpetually precarious to me, and I was especially disturbed by the way what cash it did have was being used.

I’d have expected all efforts directed at the Horse Hill prospect, drilling, surveying and getting a Competent Person’s report published to provide evidence of commercial reserves, and getting as much oil flowing as quickly as possible.

Lack of progress But no, we kept seeing new cash raised, but used for acquisitions rather than to develop the flagship prospect that is supposed to be capable of making its shareholders super-rich. Existing shareholders have been seeing their holdings consistently diluted — but perhaps not for good reasons?

As for all the other milestones we’d usually expect from an oil explorer sitting on an exciting discovery, my colleague G A Chester recently examined the firm’s record of those things not happening.

Amid updates on the rate of oil trickling from the Horse Hill-1 well, we’ve just heard of… another acquisition.

Upping the stake But this time, chief executive Stephen Sanderson says it’s “transformational,” as the firm acquires the 35% of Horse Hill held by Magellan Petroleum, a subsidiary of Tellurian Investments. The headline significance is that it will take UKOG’s interest in Horse Hill from 51% to 86%.

The acquisition is worth £12m, though only an initial £5m of that is in cash, “funded primarily by current cash reserves and partly by a convertible loan, which the company has entered into today, but has not yet drawn down.”

The rest, staggered over a period to 31 March 2020, will be in UKOG shares. Actually, it can be paid in cash at the discretion of UKOG, presumably in the event of a huge drilling success leading to UKOG shares soaring. Oh, did I mention that the price has fallen further since I last examined the company, and the loss since September 2017’s peak now stands at 91%?

Control UKOG says the deal gives it “full control over the forward Horse Hill drilling programme and production schedule, together with sole ownership of the Horse Hill oil field site lease“, adding that as a consequence “drilling of the much-anticipated HH-2/2z Portland horizontal well will follow very shortly after completion of the SPA.”

Now, my memory might be faulty, but I don’t recall any previous suggestions that Magellan Petroleum had been holding anything up.

Questions There are two big questions for me. If the Horse Hill prospect really holds such great potential, why aren’t the big oil companies queueing up to buy into it? Something counted in billions of barrels would surely be big enough to interest even BP (LON: ) or Shell (LON: ), wouldn’t it?

And why would Tellurian Investments sell such a large stake of it for the trifling sum of £5m (plus whatever the allocation of UKOG shares might be worth)? Tellurian, presumably, thinks it’s got a good deal for what it reckons is the real value of the asset.

The market reacted as if nothing had happened, with UKOG shares down a further 3% at the time of writing. No, UK Oil & Gas remains a stock from which I’m maintaining a good bargepole’s distance.

(Reuters) - European shares ended higher on Thursday as strong earnings from British American Tobacco and a multibillion dollar merger in the financial sector helped dispel early gloom after the U.S. Federal Reserve played down prospects for several rate cuts.

Providing the biggest boost to Europe's main STOXX 600 ( ), which closed up 0.5%, was a 7% jump in shares of British American Tobacco (L: ) after it beat first-half sales forecasts and predicted a stronger second half.

London Stock Exchange Group (L: ) rose 6.5% to a record high after it formally announced its $27 billion merger with financial information firm Refinitiv, lifting Europe's financial services index ( ) 2.3% and making it the top gainer.

""This seems to be a deal which puts LSE back on the map after a very uncertain period when it was almost bought out and gives it an opportunity to compete with some of the bigger names,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.

Reuters News' parent Thomson Reuters holds a 45% stake in Refinitiv and will own 15% in LSE after the deal.

The banking sector ( ) was boosted by results from European majors Barclays (L: ), Standard Chartered (L: ) and Societe Generale (PA: ).

Barclays climbed 1.2% after it raised its interim dividend. Asia-focused Standard Chartered was up 3.3% following strong first-half profits and France's SocGen gained 5.8% after it hit its solvency target a year early.

European markets opened in the red following overnight weakness on Wall Street and Asian markets after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, as expected, but disappointed investors hoping for a clear sign of several more cuts to come to support growth and stock market valuations.

The dent to sentiment from the Fed hurt commodities markets, with a fall in iron ore, and oil prices pulling down shares of mining and energy majors.

The oil and gas sector slid 1.5%, hit by a slump in shares of Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) after its second-quarter profit dropped to a 30-month low on weaker gas prices and refining margins.

The materials index ( ), down 3%, recorded its biggest percentage fall since December 2018, with London-listed shares of Rio Tinto (L: ) slipping despite the company reporting a 12% jump in first-half profit and declaring a bumper dividend.

As a result, London's FTSE 100 ( ) lagged its European peers. Adding to the gloom there, the Bank of England lowered its growth forecasts for Britain in the face of growing Brexit worries and a slowing global economy.

(Reuters) - London's blue-chip index plunged to its lowest in a month on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to hit China with more trade tariffs, while a Brexit-induced warning on targets knocked shares in Royal Bank of Scotland.

The FTSE 100 index ( ) slumped 1.8% by 0800 GMT, set for its worst day in more than four months, while the FTSE 250 midcap index ( ) weakened by 1.1%.

All of the major constituent sectors on both indexes were in negative territory.

Asia-focussed bank stocks, including HSBC (L: ), and oil majors Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) led losses on the main index after Trump vowed to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports from Sept. 1.

Industrials Melrose (L: ) and Ashtead (L: ), typically more exposed to global trade conditions, slumped 7.6% and 5%, respectively.

RBS (L: ) dropped 5%, its biggest one-day fall in nine months, as it warned that deteriorating economic conditions before Brexit were likely to derail next year's profitability and cost targets.

British Airways owner IAG (L: ), however, climbed 4% after reporting strong profit numbers for the first half of its key summer period.

MARKET WHIPLASH

The last major escalation of the U.S.-China trade tensions was behind a sharp drop in the FTSE 100 in May, but the index is still on course for its biggest annual rise since 2016 as Brexit-driven weakness in the pound helps the index's largely internationally-focused companies.

""Anyone trying to determine the next move in stock markets in the last 24 hours would be justified in feeling like they’ve just experienced a bit of whiplash,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.

""It is not hard to underestimate how much this abrupt escalation has caught markets unawares.""

Miners ( ) slumped 3% to a two-month low as Chinese iron ore futures dropped after Brazil announced a rebound in exports of the steelmaking material in July. The index, which includes global players Glencore (L: ) and Rio Tinto (L: ), is on course for its steepest weekly fall since March.

The long-drawn out trade war has also weighed on the sector as China is the world's top metals consumer.

Among a handful of gainers on the midcap index was pet supplies retailer Pets at Home (L: ) which rose 3% after saying it expects underlying profit to be slightly above current market expectations.

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (L: ) said on Thursday it would build a network of electric-vehicle charging hubs in China with China’s Didi Chuxing as the British firm bets on the world’s largest market for such cars to help profits during the transition from oil to cleaner fuels.

Retail services, such as convenience stores at petrol stations, have become a big revenue generator for oil majors such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) with profits often offsetting weakness in oil and gas production.

BP operates a fuels and convenience business across 18 countries with more than 18,700 sites. Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing company, runs a mobile transportation platform, offering users app-based options including car-sharing.

Didi's platform has 550 million users and more than 600,000 EVs run on it in China, BP said.

The venture with BP will develop charging hubs for Didi’s drivers and the wider public and add convenience stores in the near future, BP said in a statement.

The venture could build as many as 200 hubs with multiple charging points by the end of 2020, a BP spokesman said.

BP believes the venture can be scaled up to thousands of hubs across China to reach a leading market position with unmanned and remotely controlled sites, separate from BP's roughly 700 retail sites in the country, the spokesman added.

""As the world’s largest EV market, China offers extraordinary opportunities,"" BP quoted its downstream chief, Tufan Erginbilgic, as saying.

""The lessons we learn here will help us further expand BP's advanced mobility business worldwide, helping drive the energy transition and develop solutions for a low-carbon world.""

China is the world’s largest EV market, with around 50% of battery electric vehicles globally.

In January, BP said it would invest in Chinese start-up PowerShare, which links EV drivers to charging points and helps power suppliers balance distribution.

With China targeting sales of more than 7 million EVs by 2025, the need to manage demand and distribution of power on the grid, particularly at times of peak demand, will be crucial.

Corporate investors from outside the auto industry are betting on electric vehicles, vying with automakers and suppliers to bankroll companies working on everything from advanced batteries to charging devices and all-new EVs.

By Jennifer Hiller

MIDLAND, Texas (Reuters) - Seven years ago, Diamondback Energy Inc went public with a modest parcel of drillable land in the Permian Basin of West Texas.

Like dozens of other Permian startups, the firm then pursued a classic wildcatter's strategy - borrowing to buy up acreage, acquire competitors and quickly boost output in the booming shale field. Today, Diamondback (O: ) is the 7th largest producer in the top U.S. oil region, according to researcher Wood Mackenzie.

But Diamondback differs from most of its peers in a crucial way - it's poised to make more cash than it spends. The firm promised to reward investors by buying back up to $2 billion in shares and delivering $750 million in free cash flow next year if U.S. oil prices remain at about $55 per barrel. It started paying shareholders a dividend last year and raised it by 50% this spring.

""That's a big pivot for our industry, living within cash flow and not being part of that 'drill, baby, drill' crowd,"" Diamondback Chief Executive Travis Stice said in an interview.

Only a handful of independent shale firms collect more than they spend. Total overspending by a group of 29 such firms totalled $6.69 billion in 2018, according to Morningstar data provided to Reuters by the Sightline Institute and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Diamondback was among the outspenders, but Morningstar projects it will produce free cash flow this year.

The stark challenges facing the companies that pioneered the Permian signals a seismic shift in the shale economy - driven by investor demands for returns and a flood of investment from major oil firms including Chevron (N: ), Exxon Mobil (N: ), BP (L: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (L: ), with their boundless budgets and integrated operations stretching from the oilfield to the service station.

To survive and thrive, independent shale drillers must continue expanding production while slashing costs, returning profits to shareholders, and expanding into new operations such as pipelines to achieve efficiencies, according to interviews with a dozen shale executives and financiers.

Not all will make it. Six North American exploration and production firms have filed for bankruptcy this year and others are on the brink, according law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. Smaller producers on average plan to spend 20% less this year than last, with some slashing budgets as much as 60%, according to researcher Drillinginfo.

The industry's new focus on cash flow requires scrutinizing every cost down to ""pennies,"" Stice told Reuters, and shifting into what shale firms increasingly call a ""manufacturing"" strategy for drilling.

That means placing multiple wells on one patch of gravel and fracking them one after the next, then connecting them to a pre-built processing systems that link to pipelines.

A Diamondback rig that Stice can see just behind his backyard will stay in that location for six months, moving 30 feet at a time to drill eight wells in four oil layers stacked on top of each other like a pile of books. With horizontal drilling technology, the rig targets oil from a few miles away, beneath a Midland, Texas, shopping mall.

""It used to be we'd do one well, and it took 60 truck loads to move a rig,"" Stice said.

Now it takes four to eight hours to start on the next well.

""The guy that wins the game in manufacturing is the guy that can manufacture at the lowest cost,"" Stice said.

CASH IS KING

Shale firms used to lure investors with bold talk of newfound oil reserves under the ground. Now they talk about how cheaply they can get it out - emphasizing the flow of cash over the flow of crude.

Exploration firms for decades saw their stock prices surge on new discoveries. Investors assumed oil was scarce and prices would rise. But the West Texas shale boom has upended that mindset with a flood of output that has made the United States the world's top oil producer, overwhelmed domestic refiners, sent exports soaring - and kept a tight lid on prices.

Today's shale investors want quick profits and have little use for statistics on reserves or soaring production.

Two years ago, Permian bellwether Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: ) said it would target 1 million barrels of daily production by 2026. This year, Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield told analysts that goal was ""no longer a focus.""

Investors had warned the company that they would dump its stock if it ""added any rigs at all this year,"" Sheffield said in the first-quarter call with analysts. In May, the shale company disclosed it had laid off a quarter of its staff to save $100 million and ""remain competitive.""

Smaller, private-equity backed firms have traditionally assembled acreage, proved the reserves and sold out fairly quickly to a bigger firm. That strategy needs a ""complete rethink,"" said Todd Dittmann, a managing director at investment firm Angelo Gordon.

Energy investors, he said, are now more interested in firms that prove themselves capable of the operational ""blocking and tackling"" needed to profitably grow production.

Small Permian producer Elevation Resources LLC would like to sell out to the bigger firms working neighbouring properties - Occidental, Diamondback and Exxon - but so far has no takers. So CEO Steven Pruett has gone ahead with a $200 million investment to build out his operations for the long term, aiming to reward investors with regular distributions rather than a lump sum payment from a sale.

CHASING HIGHER PRICES

Stice and other shale executives are moving away from selling their production at the wellhead, taking stakes in pipelines that allow them to mimic the majors by selling at export hubs along the U.S. Gulf Coast, where prices can be several dollars higher per barrel.

Diamondback bought a 10 percent stake in two crude pipelines that will start operating this year. The investment secures transportation to the export market and gives it a cut of the profits as other firms pay to move oil along the route.

Occidental Petroleum Corp (N: ) - one of the top Permian producers, which recently bested Chevron with a $38 billion bid for Anadarko Petroleum (N: ) - has emerged as one of the top three U.S. exporters of oil.

Pioneer Natural Resources moves about 200,000 barrels per day of crude to the Gulf Coast, with 80 percent of it loaded onto ships for transport to Europe and Asia, and is looking to sign long-term deals directly with foreign buyers. Selling oil at higher international prices has earned the firm an additional $600 million over the last five quarters.

Peter Hays, a Houston lawyer who represents Permian producers, said the focus on cost-cutting and accessing higher-priced oil markets has his clients revamping their processing and pipeline contracts. They are adding provisions to limit costs and add flexibility to move products by whichever pipeline route fetches the highest price, he said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran accused the United States on Thursday of ""childish behaviour"" driven by fear after Washington imposed sanctions on its foreign minister, fanning tensions between two foes at loggerheads over Gulf shipping and Iran's nuclear programme.

Fears of a Middle East war with global repercussions have risen since the United States ditched world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Iran last year and revived sanctions on Tehran.

The Islamic Republic has retaliated by resuming uranium enrichment seen in the West seen as a potential conduit to developing atomic bombs. Iran denies having any such objective.

After several attacks in May and June on oil tankers - blamed by Washington on Tehran, which denied responsibility - U.S. President Donald Trump has been trying to forge a military coalition to secure Gulf waters, though European allies have been loath to join for fear of provoking open conflict.

European parties to the nuclear pact have called for diplomacy to defuse the crisis, but Tehran and Washington have taken hard lines and on Wednesday the Trump administration slapped sanctions on Iran's foreign minister - a likely further blow to any chances for troubleshooting dialogue.

""They (Americans) are resorting to childish behaviour... They were claiming every day 'We want to talk, with no preconditions'...and then they sanction (our) foreign minister,"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on state television.

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, a pivotal player in the nuclear deal who was educated and lived for years in the United States, dismissed the U.S. action and said it would not affect him as he had no property or other interests in America.

U.S. AFRAID OF ZARIF'S WORDS, IRAN SAYS

""A country which believes it's powerful and a world superpower is afraid of our foreign minister's interviews,"" Rouhani said, alluding to numerous interviews that Zarif - a fluent English speaker - gave to American media when he visited New York for a United Nations conference in July.

""When Dr Zarif gives an interview in New York, ... they (Americans) say Iran's foreign minister is misleading our public opinion,"" Rouhani said. ""What happened to your claims of liberty, freedom of expression and democracy?""

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Zarif was being sanctioned because he ""implements the reckless agenda of Iran's Supreme Leader...(We are) sending a clear message to the Iranian regime that its recent behaviour is completely unacceptable"".

In a tweet earlier on Thursday, Zarif said peace and dialogue were an ""existential threat"" to hawkish politicians allied with U.S. President Donald Trump who take a hardline stance against the Islamic Republic.

Zarif has in the past said that a so-called “B-team” including Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton, an ardent Iran hawk, and conservative Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could goad Trump into a war with Tehran.

In repudiating the nuclear deal reached by predecessor Barack Obama, Trump said he wanted to secure a wider accord that not only limited Iran's nuclear activity but also curbed its ballistic missile programme and reined in its support for powerful proxies in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon.

Trump intensified sanctions in May to try to strangle Iran's oil exports, the lynchpin of its economy.

FEARS FOR GULF OIL SHIPPING

The security of shipping in the Gulf, through which about a fifth of the world's oil passes, has shot up the international agenda since May when Washington accused Iran of being behind explosions that holed six tankers over several weeks.

In July, Iran seized a British-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, the Gulf's outlet to the open seas, in apparent retaliation for Britain's seizure of an Iranian ship accused of violating European sanctions by taking oil to Syria.

Britain on Thursday ruled out a swap of the two tankers. ""We are not going to barter: if people or nations have detained UK-flagged illegally then the rule of law and rule of international law must be upheld,"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.

In a sign of increasing jitters over security in the Gulf, Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) said on Thursday it was not taking any British-flagged tankers through the Strait of Hormuz for the time being.

The U.S. Embassy in Berlin said on Tuesday the United States had asked Germany to join France and Britain in a mission to protect shipping transiting the strait and ""combat Iranian aggression"". Germany rebuffed the request.

""To join the American position, which in our view is part of a strategy of maximum pressure, has never been the right path for us and will not be in the future,"" Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Germany's ZDF television.

On Thursday, Richard Grenell, U.S. ambassador to Germany, urged Berlin to take on a global responsibility to match its economic might. ""Germany is the biggest economic power in Europe. This success brings global responsibilities,"" he said.

The foreign ministry of Russia, another party to the 2015 deal, said it had the impression the United States was seeking a pretext for conflict in the Gulf, RIA news agency reported.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/iran-says-us-sanctioning-of-top-diplomat-childish-as-tensions-rise-1931819,0.088,0.8,0.112,0.9832

(Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 ended flat on Thursday despite a profit miss from Shell and dampened hopes of big U.S. interest rate cuts, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 index slipped after Brexit worries led the Bank of England to cut its growth forecasts.

The main index ( ) dipped 0.03%. Losses were contained by BAT (L: ) and as London Stock Exchange (L: ) surged 6.5% to an all-time high after a deal to buy financial information firm Refinitiv, in which Reuters News parent Thomson Reuters holds a 45% stake.

The midcap index ( ) gave up 0.2% as the BoE's actions overshadowed results-driven jumps in medical products maker Convatec (L: ) and outsourcer Capita (L: ).

Shell (L: ), the highest-valued company on the FTSE 100, fell 5% and lost more than 10 billion pounds in market capitalisation after its second-quarter profit slumped to a 30-month low.

But British American Tobacco climbed 6.9% on its best day since Nov. 2008 as higher demand for e-cigarettes helped its first-half sales beat forecasts and it pointed to a stronger second-half performance.

On the FTSE 250, ConvaTec stood out with an 18% surge after revenue trends improved in its second quarter. Capita advanced 17.3% as it remained on track to meet its turnaround targets and said Brexit could present new opportunities for private sector contractors.

But the index's fate was sealed after the BoE flagged increased Brexit worries and a slowing global economy and gave no indication that it was considering lowering rates.

""Though the BoE failed to spark the kind of fireworks produced by its American counterpart, it nevertheless played its part in chipping away at sterling's already fragile confidence,"" Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said.

Global markets had earlier tumbled after the U.S. Federal Reserve said Wednesday's 25-basis-point easing did not guarantee sustained rate cuts in the future.

Still, the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 is on course to post its biggest annual rise since 2016, drawing strength from a slump in the pound over no-deal Brexit fears.

In other moves, Rio Tinto (L: ) gave up 3.4% after announcing capital returns that Jefferies analysts called ""underwhelming"", while weakness in prices hit other miners.

Small-cap Kier (L: ), which has been battling rising debt, soared 33.3% as its average month-end net debt for 2019 was at the lower end of its forecast range.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) is not taking any British-flagged tankers through the Strait of Hormuz amid heightened tensions with Iran in the vital chokepoint for oil shipments.

""There are Shell-managed vessels in the Strait of Hormuz and that will probably continue to be the case. Currently, though, there are no UK-flagged vessels,"" Chief Executive Ben van Beurden told reporters.

If the Anglo-Dutch oil and gas company does use a British-flagged vessel in the future, it will be accompanied by the Royal Navy as a precaution, van Beurden added. Shell's rival BP (L: ) on Tuesday said it had not taken any of its own tankers through the Strait of Hormuz, along which about a fifth of the world's oil passes, since a July 10 attempt by Iran to seize one of its vessels.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell's (L: ) second-quarter profit slumped to a 30-month low due to weaker gas prices and refining margins, falling far short of expectations and denting a steady recovery in recent years.

Shares of the Anglo-Dutch company fell 4.2% as trading opened in London, compared with a 0.3% decline in London's FTSE 100 index ( ).

Shell, the world's second-largest publicly-traded energy company, joins rivals Total (PA: ) and Norway's Equinor (OL: ) in reporting weak results for the quarter.

Rising debt levels also underscored the strain Shell's dividend programme, the world's largest at over $15 billion (£12.38 billion), and a $25 billion share buyback programme, are putting on the company.

A rise in cash generation - a sign of improving operations - was the one bright spot in the company's results.

""We have delivered good cash flow performance, despite earnings volatility, in a quarter that has seen challenging macroeconomic conditions in refining and chemicals as well as lower gas prices,"" Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in a statement.

Net income attributable to shareholders in the quarter, based on current cost of supplies (CCS) and excluding identified items, dropped 25% to $3.6 billion from a year ago - the lowest since the end of 2016.

That compared with a profit forecast of $4.93 billion, according to a company-provided survey of analysts.

""This set of earnings is weaker than most were looking for and were below expectations in all the main divisions,"" Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) analyst Martijn Rats told Reuters.

""Earnings remain hard to forecast and volatile.""

Shell's debt ratio versus company capitalisation, known as gearing, rose to 27.6% from 23.6% a year ago to hit its highest level since early 2017, underscoring the difficulty in balancing large shareholder payouts. Its debt pile rose to $66.5 billion.

WEAK LNG

Profit fell short of expectations across the board but were most pronounced in the flagship liquefied (LNG)division, known as Integrated Gas, due to $479 million in impairment charges in Trinidad and Tobago and Australia, lower sales and weaker prices.

Asian LNG spot prices have more than halved since the start of the year, weighed down by soaring new production.

Oil and gas production in the quarter rose 4% from a year earlier to 3.58 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, but was down from 3.442 million boed in the first quarter of 2019.

Cash flow, a key measure for the Anglo-Dutch company, rose to $11 billion from $9.5 billion a year ago.

Free cash flow - cash available to pay for dividends and share buybacks - dropped to $6.9 billion.

Shell has focused on cash generation as a key measure of growth, targeting free cash flow of $25 to $30 billion a year between 2019 and 2021 and as much as $35 billion by 2025.

Rival BP (LON: ) on Tuesday reported stronger-than-expected profit in the quarter, which was largely unchanged from a year earlier, while France's Total (PA: ) and Norway's Equinor (OL: ) both reported sharp falls in earnings.

Exxon Mobil (N: ) and Chevron (N: ) both report on Friday.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets shook off the disappointment of a half-hearted policy easing by the on Thursday, encouraged by signs of a stabilization in the region’s manufacturing sector.

Purchasing managers indexes from around Europe (and in China) came in slightly higher than expected for July, with the ticking up to 46.5. While that still suggests the sector is contracting, it was an improvement from June 46.4, and would have been an even clearer one if hadn’t provided a negative outlier.

Even the Brexit-affected stayed at 48, defying expectations for another drop. It still remains at its lowest since immediately after the U.K. voted to leave the European Union in 2016, however.

By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro was up 0.1% at 386.14, with Italy's , Spain's and France's all outperforming the U.K. and German markets.

The PMI figures contrast with a mostly miserable set of earnings for the second quarter released earlier. Leading the losers, uncharacteristically, was Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), down 4.7% after weak gas prices pushed its profit down by 26% from a year earlier. The company’s other businesses, from upstream to chemicals, all reported weaker numbers and its debt-to-equity ratio rose further away from the targeted level of 20% - an unwelcome sign given that the company is still committed to a large buyback program.

Shell’s drop was exaggerated by the sharp drop in oil and other commodities overnight on the back of the Fed’s action and refusal to commit more clearly to further rate cuts. Miners and steelmakers also headed lower: Rio Tinto (LON: ) fell 3.2% despite the announcement of a $1 billion special dividend that reflected windfall profits from iron ore, prices for which spiked in the first half due to production problems at some of its biggest competitors.

German conglomerate Siemens (DE: ) also fell 4.9% after it reported a 6% drop in earnings in the three months to June, which chief executive Jo Kaeser blamed on “geopolitics and geoeconomics”. The company’s digital business, a key source of profit, reported double-digit drops in orders in Germany and Italy, and declines of 4%-5% in China and the U.S.

There was better news from the region’s banks. Societe Generale (PA: ) rose 4.3% after solid earnings eased concerns about its capital levels, while Barclays (LON: ) and Standard Chartered (LON: ) both rose over 2% after better-than-expected results (Barclays joined a list of European banks to report a surprising gain in bond and currency trading revenue in a quarter when all of Wall Street’s finest registered declines). Italy’s largest bank, Intesa Sanpaolo (MI: ), also extended its gains after stronger-than-expected results on Wednesday distanced it further from the general narrative of a sector plagued by bad loans.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-pmis-help-markets-shake-off-fed-disappointment-1931522,0.089,0.84,0.071,-0.8405

SHEL +0.41% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio

When looking at a stock in which I want to invest for income, I consider three main points. The first and most obvious one is that I want the company to be offering a decent dividend yield at the current price. For me, this is a ‘Goldilocks’ consideration – too high a dividend and it worries me the company is trying to entice investors for some reason, too low and it simply isn’t enough return on my investment. The 5%-6% range is where I feel just right.

Secondly, I want these dividends to be consistent. Though I am a big believer that good management shouldn’t be afraid of cutting dividends if it needs to, for an income-focused investment, this is not what I want. I want nice, steady dividend growth year in and year out, so I know my returns will hold their value.

Finally, I want to invest in a company that will hopefully see its share price climb as I hold the stock, or at the very least be in a solid position to hold its value for the long haul. This, of course, usually means a well-established company in a less volatile industry – a blue-chip firm is usually a safer choice.

The one company that I have held for the past few years, and which meets all these criteria, is the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB).

Does it tick the boxes? With these criteria in mind then, let us look at Shell’s numbers. It currently has a yield of 5.6%, with a stated policy of growing the dividend “in line with our view of the underlying earnings and cash flow”. This has seen these dividends grow by an annual rate of 5.6% over the past five years. In fact, the company hasn’t cut its dividend since 1945, an impressive statistic if ever I saw one.

That’s a tick for box one and a tick for box two.

Meanwhile, for the past three years, the company has seen both its revenue and profit margins increasing. Naturally, as with all oil companies, much of its outlook depends on the price of crude itself – not the least volatile of markets – but as my fellow Fool Rupert Hargreaves notes, Shell is “well versed in dealing with any issues that arise”.

This investor-focused offering seems set to continue for the foreseeable future as well — the company recently promising up to $125m in cash returns through dividend payments and share buybacks over the next five years.

Holding Shell for the long term seems even more viable when you consider its policies towards diversifying into renewable energy as well as even broader fields. Just last year it explored the possibility of an Uber-style car service (it later stopped its efforts as it became apparent it would not work).

All told, a tick for box three I think.

It may not be the share to pick for skyrocketing short-term capital gains, but for the long term, I back the company. For any income-focused portfolio, I think Shell is one company you can’t ignore.

Not many companies are big enough to move the single-handed. One of the few that can is Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB). Shares in the oil and gas giant are down 5% at the time of writing, after the firm reported a 25% drop in half-year profits. This drop has knocked a few points off the FTSE 100, despite gains for smaller firms.

Should you avoid Shell after today’s news? Or is the RDSB share price fall providing income investors with a good buying opportunity?

What’s happened? Shell’s net profit for the first half of 2019 fell by 25% to $8,999m. Although production rose during the period, lower prices for oil, gas and chemicals put pressure on profits.

The firm also reported lower profits from asset sales, which boosted earnings last year. If we ignore the effect of this and certain other one-off items, Shell’s half-year profits were 13% lower than last year, at $8,763m. A 25% drop in profits would be a serious concern for some businesses. But we need to remember Shell makes most of its money from selling oil and gas.

Market prices for these commodities go up and down all the time. Last year, Shell reported a 135% rise in half-year earnings. This year they’re down. As a shareholder, this doesn’t concern me — I see this as business as usual and I’m reassured by the group’s production growth.

Still a cash machine Shell’s management is actively taking steps to position the company for a future when oil consumption is lower. The firm is maximising cash generation from its oil operations while limiting spending on newer projects. The upshot of this for shareholders is that the firm is generating a lot of spare cash. Free cash flow was $10,873m for the six months, nearly $2bn more than reported profits.

This is a bit technical, but what it indicates is that Shell is spending less on new projects than it’s recording as depreciation on existing assets. Put simply, chief executive Ben van Beurden appears to be shrinking the business. This approach is also reflected in his policy on shareholder returns. Rather than investing too heavily in new projects, Shell is midway through a plan to return $25bn to shareholders through share buybacks by the end of 2020.

Alongside this, the firm plans to pay out roughly 70% of this year’s earnings in dividends. This gives the stock a yield of 6% after today’s fall — an attractive level, in my view.

It’s all about the future The big question for investors in Shell is what will happen over the next 10-20 years? The company expects to be a major gas supplier long after oil demand begins to weaken. But it’s looking for other areas in which to invest too, such as the utilities and renewables. The risk for shareholders is that the company won’t find anything that’s as big and profitable as oil.

I don’t know how successfully Shell will reinvent itself. But I think the group is well positioned to evolve and is doing the right things to protect shareholder value. After today’s fall, RDSB shares are trading on 11 times forecast earnings with a dividend yield of more than 6%. I continue to see this stock as an income buy.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (N: ) plan to accelerate asset sales, a way of delivering needed cash to finance shareholder returns and major projects, is getting off to a slow start as oil companies pull back on big deals.

On Friday, the largest U.S. oil company is expected to report a 79-cents-a-share profit, down from 92 cents a year earlier, according to data provider Refinitiv. With little cash from asset sales and a third straight quarter of weaker year-over-year earnings, Exxon cannot resume share buybacks sought by investors this year, said analysts.

Chief Executive Darren Woods this year set a target of raising $15 billion (£12.3 billion) by trimming its portfolio through 2021, above the average $3.3 billion a year rate between 2017 and 2013. The sales could include more oil-producing properties, compared with prior deals mostly in refining and marketing, he said.

But those goals are proving difficult. In its first quarter, proceeds from sales were just $107 million, the lowest in at least 11 quarters, and analysts expect the second quarter to come in at a similar level. Exxon last quarter agreed to sell a U.S. Gulf of Mexico property for $200 million.

""There’s not enough cash flow for buybacks, which is what people want to see,"" said Jennifer Rowland, analyst at Edward Jones, who has a ""hold"" rating on Exxon. Exxon may have to use debt to help fund its shareholder dividend, she said.

A package of offshore Gulf of Mexico oilfields that Exxon put on the market last autumn has languished, said analysts. More recently, the company has begun to market offshore properties in Nigeria and Norway, according to analysts and people familiar with the matter. Any one could raise several billion dollars in a sale, the people said.

Stephen Greenlee, who oversees divestitures as president of Exxon's Upstream Business Development group, was not available to address the asset sales, an Exxon spokesman said.

Exxon shares are rated a ""buy"" by just 23% of analysts, below BP PLC's (L: ) at 71%, Chevron Corp's (N: ) 74%, Royal Dutch Shell's (L: ) 80% and Total SA's (PA: ) 89%, according to Refinitiv.

""The market is not ready to pay what Exxon thinks these assets are worth,"" William Turner, a vice president at researcher Welligence, said of the offshore U.S. properties. ""A lot of the recent transactions in the Gulf of Mexico have been going at discounted valuations.""

Exxon's pitches are not the only going unanswered, said a U.S. merger and acquisition advisor who requested anonymity speaking about M&A matters. ""There has been less activity. I'm not sure if it is the bid/ask or something else; but they just aren't there,"" the person said.

There is no doubt Exxon's cash could use a boost. Analysts slashed earnings forecasts to 79 cents a share from 97 cents after the company disclosed operating unit expectations this month.

""We expect another large funding gap this quarter,” wrote Cowen (O: ) analyst Jason Gabelman, who estimated Exxon's organic free cash flow this quarter will not cover the $3.7 billion needed for dividends.

The two areas expected to show improved margins during the period, crude sales and refining, were offset by weaker prices and higher maintenance costs. The result was ""another disappointing quarter,"" wrote Biraj Borkhataria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a client note.

Exxon has been investing to boost production in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, and in offshore Guyana. Exxon ""is always countercyclical"" and ""has to be viewed in the long term,"" said John Groton, director of equity research at Thrivent Asset Management, which holds Exxon shares.

MILAN (Reuters) - A witness in a corruption case involving Italian oil firm Eni (MI: ) told a court on Monday that a senior official from the company had bribed him to withdraw his allegations of graft, which he had agreed to do.

Vincenzo Armanna is both a prosecution witness and a defendant in the trial in which Eni is accused of acquiring a Nigerian oilfield in 2011 by corruptly paying middlemen. Both he and Eni have denied wrongdoing.

Armanna worked for Eni from 2006 to 2013, when he was sacked in a dispute over expenses, he has said.

Addressing a packed court on Monday, he said Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi authorised a company manager named Claudio Granata to approach him and offer him his job back if he agreed to modify his testimony.

Both Descalzi and Granata have denied the accusation, which was initially leaked to the Italian press a week ago.

""Eni underlines that the statements made by Armanna regarding the conduct of Eni, its CEO and its management in the context of this operation are totally groundless,"" the company said in a statement following Monday's court session.

Armanna said he met Granata in a Rome square in May 2016.

""Claudio Granata asked me on behalf of Descalzi if I could make a memorandum to correct my interrogation statements to Milan prosecutors and remove the reference to corruption,"" he said. ""In return I was offered a job back with Eni.""

""Granata gave me a piece of paper in which he had written some notes. I then copied them and presented the memo that I deposited in Milan on May 26, 2016, in which I defended Descalzi,"" he added.

Asked by prosecutor Fabio De Pasquale why he had decided to revert to his original statement, Armanna said his lawyer had advised him it would be ""legal suicide"" to stick with his new version of events.

Armanna did not return to work for Eni and was not asked by the court what had happened. The case continues on Tuesday.

Eni is accused of buying the Nigerian oilfield in the knowledge that the vast majority of the $1.3 billion purchase price would be siphoned off to agents and middlemen in corrupt payments.

Oil major Shell (L: ), which jointly bought the field with Eni, is also on trial for corruption over the deal. It denies any wrongdoing.

While the trial against Eni and Shell enters its final stages, Milan prosecutors continue to investigate the allegations that Eni officials sought to obstruct justice in the Nigeria case.

LONDON (Reuters) - Four-and-a-half years after the Swiss National Bank dramatically lifted the franc's cap against the euro, markets are betting the central bank may be forced to resume its accumulation of foreign cash yet again to rein in its supercharged currency.

The SNB is in a bind as the European Central Bank looks set to ease monetary policy yet again - forcing the Swiss to either double down on its already super-easy policy or intervene again ad hoc to limit the franc against the euro.

At last count, total SNB foreign currency reserves were already three quarters of a trillion dollars.

And any further currency intervention by the SNB has huge potential ramifications for global asset markets - from top-rated euro zone sovereign bonds and blue chip U.S. and UK stocks to A-rated European corporate debt.

The SNB's massive euro purchases in the currency markets to date are recycled and banked in this broad array of stocks, bonds and other assets around the world.

This week, the Swiss franc surged anew against the euro ( ) to its strongest in two years and may strengthen even further after Thursday's ECB's monetary policy meeting, when President Mario Draghi is widely expected to set the stage for a September rate cut.

Money markets are pricing in a 54% chance of a matching SNB interest rate cut by September and a near 80% probability by December; interest rates are already at minus 0.75% - the lowest in the developed market world.

Unlike some of its developed market peers, the SNB has been steadily buying equities and corporate debt on an increasing scale while reducing its exposure to government debt since 2009.

And even in the government bond space, it has quietly extended duration, resulting in large capital gains on its bond portfolio as interest rates globally plummeted, data from its annual report showed.

Equity holdings by SNB have soared to around $100 billion with value of U.S. equities it owned more than doubling as it pumped in more money into U.S. equities, which have been in a record bull-run.

Below is a series of charts, including a detailed snapshot on the SNB's equity holdings, based on Refinitiv data, Swiss National Bank data and SEC filings:

1/ $100 BILLION IN EQUITIES

A fifth of Swiss National Bank's foreign exchange reserves are in equities, worth $100 billion - that's 1/7th the size of Switzerland's GDP.

If it were a hedge fund, it would be one of the biggest in the world. Its top 25 holdings are in U.S. equities with a big footprint in technology companies such as Apple (O: ), Facebook (O: ), Microsoft (O: ) and Amazon (O: ).

The value of U.S. equity ownership more than doubled since 2014-end.

2/ EUROPEAN STOCKS

Aside from the United States, the bank's biggest equity stakes are in UK heavyweights, including Royal Dutch Shell (L: ) and British American Tobacco (L: ).

The non-U.S. assets are worth about $9 billion, according to Reuters' calculations based on the most recent Refinitiv data.

LONDON (Reuters) - A strong rise in oil and gas production helped BP (L: ) offset weaker crude prices and refining profit to again beat profit expectations on Tuesday, boosting its shares.

BP's second quarter contrasts with Total (PA: ) and Norway's Equinor (OL: ), which posted sharp earnings drops, and builds on a steady recovery after deep cost cuts since the 2014 downturn, project start-ups and last year's $10.5 billion purchase of BHP's U.S. shale assets.

""At the midpoint of our five-year plan, BP is right on target,"" Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement.

By 0953 GMT, BP shares were up 3.1% to 543.5 pence, the top gainers in the FTSE 100 ( ) index.

Although BP's dividend remained unchanged at 10.25 cents per share, its Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said the company would consider raising it towards the end of the year as proceeds from asset sales come through and debt is reduced.

BP's results beat expectations for 10 quarters in a row, analysts at Bernstein said.

""Strong volume growth from accretive barrels and seamless execution remains underappreciated,"" said Bernstein, which has an ""outperform"" recommendation on the stock.

Underlying replacement cost profit, the company's definition of net income, reached $2.8 billion in the second quarter, exceeding a company-provided forecast of $2.46 billion.

The second-quarter profit was up from $2.4 billion in the previous quarter, while BP's operating cash flow recovered to $6.8 billion in the quarter from $5.3 billion in the previous quarter as a result of a one-off working capital release.

HIGHER PRODUCTION

Second-quarter production rose to 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, 4% higher than a year earlier.

BP said it expects third-quarter 2019 reported production to be lower than second-quarter, reflecting maintenance activities as well as the impact of Hurricane Barry on operations in the Gulf of Mexico.

Benchmark prices in the second quarter averaged around $69 a barrel, up from $63 the previous quarter but down from $74 a barrel a year earlier, BP said.

In the refining and marketing segment, known as downstream, profits dropped due to lower sales and refinery throughput as plants underwent maintenance ahead of a major change in marine fuel standards in 2020.

Global growth in oil demand slowed in the first half of the year to around 1 million barrels per day but has slightly recovered in the second half, CFO Gilvary told Reuters.

Graphic: BP Q2 cashflow - https://tmsnrt.rs/2yp7B2U

Despite the higher profit, BP's debts rose in the first half of the year to $46.5 billion from $38.7 billion the previous year, mostly as a result of the BHP acquisition.

Gearing, the ratio between debt and BP's market value, rose to 31% compared with 27.5%.

Shell (L: ) reports results on Thursday, while Exxon Mobil (N: ) and Chevron (N: ) are scheduled for Friday.

STRAIT OF HORMUZ

BP has not taken any of its oil tankers through the Strait of Hormuz since a July 10 attempt by Iran to seize one of its vessels, Gilvary said.

Gilvary added that the company had no plans to take any of its tankers through the world's most important waterway for oil shipments, but was moving oil out of the region using chartered tankers.

BP (LSE:LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE:RDSB) are two of the biggest companies in the . What are the chances for these oil barons to boost your wealth?

At the time of writing, BP trades at 522p with a decent yield of 5.95% and a reasonable price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 13.74. BP’s profits have been rocketing forward from £172 million in 2016 to £9,578 million in 2018.

Here is a key fundamental reason why I have been bullish on oil for over a decade: there is only a limited amount of oil in the world with a fairly consistent rising demand.

BP only needs an oil price of around $40 a barrel to break even. is currently trading at $63.32, and has been above $50 a barrel since mid 2017. I firmly believe that oil will eventually reach $100 a barrel again (as it did in 2014) primarily due to supply and demand, which I’ll dive into further in this article.

In addition to this, oil is increasingly difficult for UK companies to obtain. Lord Ron Oxburgh, former chairman of Shell, stated in 2008: “It is pretty clear that there is not much chance of finding any significant quantity of new cheap oil. Any new or unconventional oil is going to be expensive.”

For example, companies will have to either drill hundreds of miles underwater to capture black gold, as BP is increasingly doing in the North Sea, or often attempt to procure it from regions where there are a number of difficulties.

Oil made headline news recently when two British-owned tankers were seized by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz. Geopolitical tensions remain high in this region, which is a further factor that can push prices up.

In terms of increasing demand, I believe that many people underestimate the potential growth of China and India to guzzle oil. Millions more citizens in these nations will have cars in the coming years, I believe, and the vast majority of those vehicles won’t be electric.

BP is being resourceful in finding different forms of energy other than oil. It has paid BHP Group $10.5 billion for its shale assets, and has other renewable assets such as wind power.

Dividends are a crucial part of overall investment returns. So with the company increasing its dividend to 10.25 US cents per share, I will certainly continue to hold BP.

The same is true for Royal Dutch Shell. Currently trading at 2,563p with a decent dividend yield of 5.63%, the worldwide giant has a low P/E ratio of 11.24. Like BP, it is pumping some of its spare cash into buying back its own shares.

Its dividend record is one of the best out there, having not cut its dividend since 1945. Dividend cover is 1.5, higher than BP’s 1.14.

If I had to pick one quality oil producer between BP and Shell, I would opt for the latter: BP is still paying out compensation from its massive oil accident in 2010. Yet I first purchased Shell in 2015, with my last buy on 28 January 2019 at 2,269p. Overall in capital gains I’m up over 30%, plus juicy dividends.

(Reuters) - Gains in oil heavyweights amid heightened tensions in the Middle East helped London's main index outperform its European counterparts on Monday, while Ted Baker was in demand after multiple media reports of takeover plans.

The FTSE 100 index of bluechip companies ( ) and the FTSE 250 midcap index ( ) added 0.1% each by 0758 GMT.

Oil majors Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) were higher, tracking gains in crude prices on concerns that Iran's seizure of a British tanker last week may lead to supply disruptions in the Middle East. [O/R]

Monday's gains in the midcap bourse were led by Ted Baker Plc (L: ) with a 15.5% jump, after a media report that its founder Ray Kelvin could back a private equity buyout of the retailer, months after he resigned.

Tour operator TUI's (L: ) London-listed shares rose 2.7%, topping the FTSE 100 leader-board, with a trader citing a ""buy"" rating from Stifel, and a ratings upgrade from Barclays for Sainsbury's (L: ) 2.1% gain.

Helped in part by expectations of interest rate cuts by central banks, the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 has recovered from a slump it had weathered in May due to global trade uncertainty, and is currently on course for its best year since 2016.

The index, which earns roughly two-thirds of its profits in the U.S. dollar, has also benefited as Brexit jitters have pressured the pound. On Friday, a Reuters poll showed eurosceptic Boris Johnson leading Jeremy Hunt in the race to be the next Prime Minister.

Am I crazy? Surely everyone needs to save for retirement (apart from bank robbers and oil barons)?

Of course, you’re right. Building up a retirement pot to help fund your later years is important.

But I’m not crazy. And I still wouldn’t recommend saving for retirement.

Invest, don’t save The reason for this is that saving means keeping your money in cash. And that means that your money isn’t working for you.

What I’d recommend is investing for retirement. That means converting your cash into an asset that will hopefully increase in value over time. Ideally, it would provide an income as well.

The cost of cash There are two reasons why I think saving in cash for your retirement is a bad idea: inflation and low interest rates.

UK inflation was 2% in June, the latest figure available. By contrast, the best Cash ISA savings rate I can find at the time of writing is 1.87% on a three-year fixed rate deal. For easy access Cash ISA accounts, rates are lower.

This means that in real terms (after inflation), money saved in cash is falling in value each year.

Admittedly, things haven’t always been this grim for cash savers. According to data gathered by Barclays (LON: ), over the last 100 years or so, savers have earned an average of about 1% above inflation.

However, stock market investors have earned about 5% per year above inflation over the same period.

Look at these numbers What does this mean in terms of cold, hard cash? I’ve used the figures above to estimate how much you’d need to save each month to build up a retirement pot of £250k, adjusted for inflation, in 20 years’ time:

Cash saving per month: £941

Stock market investment per month: £608

These numbers suggest that saving in cash will require you to save 50% more than if you put your money into the stock market. Ouch.

Long-term profits I should point out that the stock market isn’t suitable for short-term savings. In the short term — under five years — anything could happen to share prices. But history suggests that over longer periods, the market usually goes up.

Patient investors who are willing to ride out any short-term storms can usually do well.

Where to invest? As you’ll guess, my choice of investment is the UK stock market. I’m building a portfolio of large, dividend-paying stocks that I can hold for years with minimal trading, to keep costs low. To avoid future tax bills, all my shares are in a Stocks and Shares ISA.

Most of my choices come from the . For example, I own shares of pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline, oil and gas firm Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and property firm British Land.

As I’m still working, I add cash to my portfolio each month and periodically use this to buy more shares. If this sounds a little too complicated, then an easier alternative would be to invest your cash in a FTSE 100 tracker fund each month.

Whatever you choose, I’d urge you to start as soon as possible. The earlier you start, the harder your money will work for you.

ABUJA (Reuters) - The Supreme Court in London will hear an appeal by Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue claims in England against oil major Shell (L: ) over oil spills in the Niger Delta, lawyers for the two affected communities said on Wednesday.

The decision to hear the appeal re-opens the possibility for British multinationals to be held liable at home for their subsidiaries' actions abroad. It comes after a setback in February last year when a London court ruled that the claim could not be pursued in England.

""The decision will allow the two communities from Bille and Ogale in the Niger Delta to appeal to the UK's highest court, having suffered from decades of pollution from Shell's pipelines,"" Leigh Day, the law firm representing the communities, said in a statement.

The main question for the courts is whether they have jurisdiction over claims against Shell's Nigerian subsidiary Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), which is jointly operated with the Nigerian government.

""We maintain that claims by Nigerian communities against a Nigerian company about events in Nigeria, should be heard in Nigeria and not the UK,"" said an SPDC spokeswoman.

SPDC maintains the spills are chiefly due to oil theft, sabotage and illegal refining.

But the communities maintain they cannot seek redress locally.

""The English courts are our only hope because we cannot get justice in Nigeria,"" said King Okpabi, the ruler of the Ogale community, in Wednesday's statement.

Ruling on a similar case in April, London's Supreme Court decided that Zambian villagers had the right to sue India-listed mining company Vedanta (NS: ) in England.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/uk-supreme-court-to-hear-nigerians-case-for-pursuing-shell-spill-claim-in-england-1923796,0.037,0.923,0.04,0.4471

In recent years, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which track a market or index, have become very popular with investors. So much so that a lot of investors today don’t even bother trying to pick stocks any more. Why go to all the effort of stock picking, when you can just buy the market through an ETF?

It’s a fair question. Especially when you consider how hard it is to consistently beat the market. That said, while ETFs have their advantages, I still believe there’s a place for stock picking today. Here’s a look at why I prefer to pick individual stocks for my portfolio, rather than invest in a tracker fund.

Outperformance potential For starters, one of the reasons I prefer to pick stocks is that there are many stocks within the FTSE 100 that I don’t want to own. I’m talking about the kinds of companies that are highly leveraged, or at risk of cutting their dividends. A good example is BT Group (LON: ). BT has a huge debt pile, a massive pension deficit, and its dividend looks unsustainable. In short, it’s a low-quality stock. Now, if I buy a FTSE 100 tracker, I’m stuck with exposure to BT. However, by picking my own stocks, I can avoid it. And by avoiding low-quality companies, I give myself a chance of beating the market over time.

Higher yield Secondly, by picking individual stocks I can construct a portfolio that has a higher yield than the FTSE 100. Right now, the FTSE 100 has a median forward-looking dividend yield of 3.9% according to Stockopedia. However, my own dividend portfolio has a yield of 4.4%. Ultimately, that means I’m picking up more cash dividends every year than I would if I was invested in a FTSE 100 tracker.

Dividend growth To obtain a high yield, I’m not sacrificing dividend growth either. My investment strategy, in general, is to focus on companies that are increasing their dividends regularly. Examples include stocks such as Unilever (LON: ), Diageo (LON: ), and Prudential (LON: ). This means that my income stream is likely to grow faster than it would if I was invested in a FTSE 100 tracker. Many companies at the top of the FTSE 100 such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), HSBC, and GSK haven’t increased their dividends for years which means that dividend growth for the index as a whole is not likely to be high.

Life-changing returns Finally, I’ll point out that at the smaller end of the market, stock picking also provides the potential to generate life-changing returns. For example, look at online fashion retailer Boohoo. A £2,000 investment there four years ago would be worth around £20,000 today. You’re never going to get those kinds of returns by investing in the market.

So, in summary, while ETFs do have their advantages, I continue to see plenty of appeal in picking individual stocks. Whether your goal is a higher dividend yield than the market or explosive returns from small-caps, stock picking can be extremely rewarding if you’re willing to put in the effort.

The collection of a majority of UK local newspapers under a single owner may concern those who believe in a plurality of voices.

But what does it do for investors?

The Reach (LSE:RCH) share price jumped 8% on 18 July when the Daily Mirror owner confirmed it was in talks to buy out the majority of rival JPI Media’s assets.

The deal would put the likes of The i, The Scotsman, The Yorkshire Post and hundreds of small local newspapers in Reach’s growing stable.

Reach rebranded from Trinity Mirror in 2018 after the £200m buyout of Richard Desmond’s Northern & Shell (LON: ) titles, including the Daily Express and the Daily Star.

And this latest acquisition puts the £256m market cap firm in a better position to challenge the competition: DMGT, which owns the Daily Mail, and Rupert Murdoch’s News UK, operator of The Sun and The Times.

So are the fundamentals good enough to squeeze this stock into my portfolio?

The dividend yield jumped from 3.1% in 2015 to 7.3% at the end of 2017. And total dividends paid out to shareholders have grown steadily, if not spectacularly, over the past five years. But steady growth is good.

What Reach does best is digital identity. Its flagship regional title the Manchester Evening reportedly reaches a million people every day, and Reach has embraced a mobile-first audience keen on social sharing with a colourful and simple brand that it repeats across big city titles like the Birmingham Mail and the Liverpool Echo.

Now today’s half-yearly results to 30 June reveal operating profits up 7.2% to £71.3m, pre-tax profits 8% higher at £69.9m, earnings per share up almost 5% to 19.1p and the interim dividend per share gaining 5.5% to 2.50p.

The end of 2018 results reported in February were not good. The group posted £120m of pre-tax losses, with earnings per share plunging to an eye-watering minus 41p.

But the Reach share price has recovered. Now priced at nearly 90p, these are levels we’ve not seen since May 2018.

There is sturdy cash flow, up 16% year on year, while net debt fell by £27.9m to £12.9m with CEO Simon Fox telling the market that the group’s trading position remains positive.

To me, leadership is everything, especially when I’m looking for long-term, set-and-forget dividend stocks.

So I think Reach has an especially bright future because of one piece of news confirmed today: Fox is due to depart after seven years at the helm, to be replaced by former Ladbrokes (LON: ) Coral CEO Jim Mullen.

Mullen’s record at the bookmaking giant gives me hope that Reach will continue its ascent. Early in his Ladbrokes tenure Mullen oversaw the £2.3bn merger with Gala Coral, a 2016 megadeal that created the UK’s largest gambling company.

He also spent three years as chief operating officer at News UK in the late 2000s, before taking charge at William Hill. I think Mullen has the chops to help Reach integrate all the moving parts it now has to corral.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed around 2% on Friday after the U.S. Navy destroyed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz, a major chokepoint for global crude flows, again raising tensions in the Middle East.

Brent crude ( ) futures were up $1.28 cents, or 2.1%, at $63.21 by 0329 GMT. They had dropped 2.7% on Thursday, falling for a fourth day that leaves them still set for a weekly drop of more than 5%.

West Texas Intermediate crude ( ) futures firmed 97 cents, or 1.8%, at $56.27. They ended 2.6% lower in the previous session, and are heading for a weekly decline of more than 6%.

Indications that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates aggressively to support the economy were also behind Friday's gains, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at Vanguard Markets.

""The Fed backstop and the report of the U.S. Navy shooting down an Iranian drone are providing a modicum of support for oil markets amidst a very bearish landscape,"" he said.

The United States said on Thursday that a U.S. Navy ship had ""destroyed"" an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz after the aircraft threatened the vessel, but Iran said it had no information about losing a drone.

The move comes after Britain pledged to defend its shipping interests in the region, while U.S. Central Command chief General Kenneth McKenzie said the United States would work ""aggressively"" to enable free passage after recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf.

Graphic: Iran's guards say they seized a foreign oil tanker in the Gulf, https://tmsnrt.rs/32tzK6J

Still, the longer-term outlook for oil has grown increasingly bearish.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) is reducing its 2019 oil demand forecast due to a slowing global economy amid a U.S.-China trade spat, its executive director said on Thursday.

The IEA is revising its 2019 global oil demand growth forecast to 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) and may cut it again if the global economy and especially China shows further weakness, Fatih Birol said.

""China is experiencing its slowest economic growth in the last three decades, so are some of the advanced economies ... if the global economy performs even poorer than we assume, then we may even look at our numbers once again in the next months to come,"" Birol told Reuters in an interview.

Last year, the IEA predicted that 2019 oil demand would grow by 1.5 million bpd but had already cut the growth forecast to 1.2 million bpd in June this year.

Speculators have exited options positions that could have provided exposure to higher prices in the next several years, market participants said on Thursday.

U.S. offshore oil and gas production has continued to return to service since Hurricane Barry passed through the Gulf of Mexico last week, triggering platform evacuations and output cuts.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ), a top Gulf producer, said Wednesday it had resumed about 80% of its average daily production in the region.",https://uk.investing.com//news/commodities-news/oil-rises-after-us-navy-destroys-iranian-drone-1920275,0.09,0.847,0.063,-0.8591

LONDON (Reuters) - Climate activists Extinction Rebellion will not be allowed to repeat the kind of disruption they caused in London earlier this year when they hold fresh demonstrations in October, police said on Thursday.

Thousands of supporters of the movement occupied four sites in central London for 11 days in April, pushing climate change up the political agenda with one the largest civil disobedience campaigns seen in Britain in decades.

Police said they had been forced to divert officers from tackling crime and policing neighbourhoods to deal with the protests - which including using a pink sailboat to block Oxford Circus, a major thoroughfare and shopping centre.

""We thought that April was wholly unacceptable,"" Laurence Taylor, deputy assistant commissioner of London's police, told reporters at the force's New Scotland Yard headquarters.

""It went well beyond the realm of what was reasonable and we would not tolerate that level of disruption again.""

Extinction Rebellion says it wants to cause even greater disruption in October than it did in April, when protests included stopping trains, defacing the offices of oil major Shell (L: ) and demonstrating outside Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) .

Laurence also warned the group against any attempt to disrupt London's Heathrow Airport. Extinction Rebellion has said it is considering a plan to force the airport to ground flights by flying drones at head height in an exclusion zone outside the perimeter to avoid posing any danger to aircraft.

""We will absolutely not tolerate incursions into the airport, endangering the aircraft or disrupting the daily management of Heathrow,"" Laurence said.

Extinction Rebellion wants to use non-violent civil disobedience to force governments to cut carbon emissions and avert a climate crisis that it says will bring social collapse. In Britain, it has sought to maintain momentum this week by holding a ""summer uprising"" of smaller-scale protests in London, Leeds, Glasgow, Cardiff and Bristol.

Laurence said the Metropolitan Police arrested more than 1,150 people during the April protests and around 180 have been charged so far.

""We absolutely respect people's fundamental right to protest, but we do not accept that extends to causing misery and mass disruption to everybody,"" Taylor said.

Extinction Rebellion has won the backing of scientists, researchers and academics who worry that the official response to climate change is lagging far behind the severity of the crisis.

(Reuters) - Jim Herman won the Barbasol Championship in Kentucky by a stroke on Sunday, crediting his second U.S. Tour victory to a new putter and some timely advice from President Donald Trump.

A former assistant pro at Trump National golf course in New Jersey, Herman carded a final round of two-under 70 to finish at 26-under-par, edging fellow American Kelly Kraft at Keene Trace in Nicholasville.

After tearing up the course with a 62 on Saturday to take a one-stroke lead over Kraft, Herman revealed he had taken a congratulatory phone call from Trump the night before.

After closing out his win, Herman said he had taken Trump's advice to use a new putter.

""He motivates me and puts me in a good spot,” said Herman, who has known Trump for years.

""I don’t know what it is about him, but he gets me going in the right direction with golf. I took his advice and put a new putter in play.

""Couldn’t have putted any better this week.""

Some late wobbles by Kraft also played a major part in Herman's triumph.

Kraft had a one-shot lead with three holes to play but bogeyed the 16th and 17th holes.

Herman closed out the win with pars on his last three holes.

Austria’s Sepp Straka finished third at 23-under-par while Australian Matt Jones and American Austin Cook tied for fourth at 22-under.

Rain saw play held up for three hours on Sunday.

Herman claimed his first win since his maiden triumph at the 2016 Shell (LON: ) Houston Open.

Cash ISAs are extremely popular with UK savers and for many people, they remain the savings vehicle of choice. This is illustrated by the fact that at the end of the 2017/18 financial year, approximately £268bn was held in them.

Yet with the average Cash ISA paying just 1.32% in interest right now, holding a large proportion of your wealth in one could be a huge mistake, in my view, particularly if you’re saving for the long term. I say this because UK inflation came in at 2% in June, and has averaged close to that all year, meaning that any money sitting in a Cash ISA is effectively losing value over time.

Of course, having some cash savings is important. Cash gives you options and is essential for emergencies. However, with interest rates of just over 1% on offer right now, Cash ISAs have little appeal, to my mind.

The Lifetime ISA Personally, I’m a much bigger fan of the Lifetime ISA. This has several major advantages over the cash variety.

First, unlike the Cash ISA, the Lifetime ISA enables you to hold a wide range of growth investments such as stock and funds. This means that it’s possible to earn a much higher return on your money.

For example, in a Lifetime ISA, you could hold a selection of dividend stocks such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and Lloyds Bank. Right now, these stocks offer dividend yields of 5.8% and 6% respectively – over four times the average Cash ISA interest rate.

Alternatively, you could buy an investment fund such as Fundsmith Equity fund. This particular option has returned over 70% in the last three years alone, although past performance is no guarantee of future performance.

A 25% risk-free return Yet where the Lifetime ISA really comes into its own is the fact that for every pound you contribute, up to £4,000 per year, the government will add in 25p for you. Put in £100 and you’ll pick up £25 for free. Put in £1,000 and you’ll pocket £250 for free. Contribute the full £4,000 allowance and you’ll pick up a huge £1,000 for free! That’s a 25% return for doing absolutely nothing. That sure beats the 1% on offer from Cash ISAs, in my view.

What’s the catch? Now, of course, a great deal like this doesn’t come without a catch. There are a few important details you need to know about. Firstly, you can only open a Lifetime ISA if you’re aged between 18 and 40. Secondly, you can’t withdraw your money (without harsh penalties) until you either turn 60 or buy your first property. In other words, the Lifetime ISA is designed to help you save for your first house or for retirement. As such, it won’t be for everybody.

However, if you are saving for retirement, or for your first home, it could certainly be worth considering as a savings vehicle. A risk-free 25% return plus the opportunity to grow your money through stocks and funds certainly beats 1% from a Cash ISA, to my mind.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn on Thursday formally launched a proxy fight against Occidental Petroleum (N: ) to win control of four board seats, according to a regulatory filing, after talks with the oil company's chief executive failed to reach an agreement.

Icahn, who owns 4.4% of Occidental shares, last month said he planned to launch a proxy fight to oust and replace four Occidental directors. Icahn has blasted the Houston-based oil and gas producer for failing to give owners a say on its proposed $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum (N: ), which he has called ""misguided and hugely overpriced.""

""Occidental refused to craft a compromise and so we'll happily take our case to stockholders which the company should have done with this bet-the-company transaction,"" Icahn told Reuters on Thursday.

""We prefer to have peace and have a great record in reaching settlements,"" Icahn added.

Occidental, whose board of directors has 10 members, did not respond to requests for comment. In its own recent securities filings, the company called the Icahn requests ""not in the best interests of Occidental or its shareholders"" and urged they not sign the solicitation.

In the proxy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Icahn identified his four candidates for the board: John Hofmeister, the former president of Shell (LON: ) Oil Company; Alan LeFevre, the former finance chief of consumer goods firm Jarden Corp; and Nicholas Graziano and Andrew Langham, two executives with Icahn's own investment company.

Icahn spoke with Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub on July 10 in an 11th-hour effort to reach a compromise and avert a proxy fight. His associates also spoke with Occidental executives twice earlier this month, according to the filing.

If Icahn's proxy solicitation is successful in forcing a special meeting of shareholders, the record date for a vote on the Icahn candidates could be scheduled as soon as September or October.

Icahn expects to schedule meetings with Occidental shareholders in the next four weeks to press the case for board seats. The proxy fight is unlikely to stop the Anadarko deal, but would influence the pace and direction of billions of dollars of asset sales that will result after the acquisition closes.

Occidental has proposed selling Anadarko's Africa assets, including a proposed Mozambique liquefied project estimated to cost $20 billion. Anadarko also owns significant offshore wells and production platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

Freeport-McMoRan, which in 2016 sold some of those same offshore assets to Anadarko, did so while under pressure from Icahn's investment fund, which held seats on the mining firm's board.

Anadarko shareholders are expected vote in favour of the Occidental deal Aug. 8.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/icahn-launches-proxy-fight-after-stalled-talks-with-occidental-ceo-1920265,0.044,0.869,0.087,0.9467

The oil price has fallen over the last few days as tensions with Iran ease slightly, leaving a barrel of trading at around $64. The price is becalmed, but I still think this is a good time to invest in the oil & gas sector.

High energy One tempting option is upstream explorer Premier Oil (LSE: PMO), whose share price has jumped 15% over the last month and that was before today’s positive trading and operations update, which showed first-half production up 11% to 84,100 barrels of oil equivalent a day (boepd) year-on-year.

The group is now on track to meet its previously increased full-year production guidance of 75,000 to 80,000 boepd, boosted by a significant upgrade to the gross resource estimate at its Zama operations in Mexico, while its planned Tolmount UK growth product is scheduled to produce its first gas by the end of 2020.

Debt down The Premier Oil share price has been hit by concerns over its debt pile, but free cash flow generation of $180m over the last six months has allowed management to shrink this slightly to $2.15bn, with forecast full-year net debt reduction of more than $300m.

Chief executive Tony Durrant hailed “a strong first half”, and said he was particularly pleased with the continued high operating efficiency of its producing portfolio. It funded the cut in debt and “remains a top priority for the group”. He also reckoned its exploration portfolio offers “substantial upside exposure”.

Premier play listed Premier Oil has a global spread of operations across the North Sea, South East Asia, the Falkland Islands and Latin America, which include some exciting offshore prospects. As always, it remains at the mercy of the oil price, and needs to keep chiselling away at that debt, which is still more than three times its market cap of £661m.

The ride may be too bumpy for some investors even though Premier Oil stock is valued at a tempting 9.9 times forecast earnings. Others may be put off by the fact that there is no dividend, and prefer my other oil sector pick instead.

Right Royal dividend In these uncertain times, it may feel safer to invest in vertically integrated behemoth Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB), whose market cap of £207bn dwarfs Premier Oil. Its stock is up a solid 12% so far this year, broadly in line with the wider index.

Interestingly, while the FTSE 100 trades at around 18 times earnings, the Shell share price looks better value at just 12 times. It looks a more rewarding dividend prospect as well, yielding 5.7% against 4.3% across the index.

Sure of Shell Shell doesn’t offer the one-stop-shop diversification of a FTSE 100 tracker, but the above comparison still makes it look irresistible. That said, earnings are forecast to fall by around 5% over the next year, and we know what a slowing global economy does to the oil price.

The dividend looks solid with the oil price comfortably above Shell’s break-even point, while management is aiming to buy back at least $25bn of its shares by the end of 2020. It could be ideal for a starter portfolio. I would say, buy this dividend hero first, and maybe stick Premier Oil on your watch list.

(Reuters) - The FTSE 100 index tumbled on Wednesday amid sharp falls in oil majors as investors priced in an overnight slide in crude to one-week lows, while downbeat trading updates knocked chemicals group Johnson Matthey and miner Fresnillo .

Shell (L: ) and BP (L: ) slipped 1.5% and 2.9% respectively, and were the biggest drags on the blue-chip index, pulling the FTSE 100 ( ) 0.6% lower even as global oil prices recovered some ground. The midcaps ( ) dipped 0.2%.

Johnson Matthey (L: ) skidded 5.4% - its biggest one-day fall in nearly four years - to the bottom of the main index after it said profit at its Clean Air business, which provides the lion's share of its earnings, would fall this year.

Fresnillo (L: ) also slid 2.8% after it cut its annual production targets, citing lower-than-expected ore grades and construction delays at a gold mine in Mexico.

Investor appetite for riskier assets was also put off by U.S. President Donald Trump's comments that the United States still had a long way to go to close a trade deal with China.

""Some of the hesitation seen in U.S. markets (from U.S.-China trade tensions) will spill over to the UK as well, with concerns that economic weakness is beginning to deepen even as central banks look to respond with easing,"" IG Markets analyst Chris Beauchamp said.

The falls across oil stocks, banks and miners more than offset gains for exporters like Imperial Brands (L: ) and Diageo (L: ), which benefited from the pound's slide to a two-year low against the dollar, the product of both Brexit concerns around the Conservative leadership election and a run of U.S. data which has bolstered the greenback.

Though sterling recovered slightly later on, exporters still managed to hold on to the day's gains.

Seeking to woo voters on the right, both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have indicated they could take Britain out of the European Union without a deal at the end of October, potentially sparking chaos at British ports and hammering growth.

""It is increasingly looking like there is going to be something far scarier than ghouls and ghosts on Halloween 2019: a no-deal Brexit,"" Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said.

Brexit jitters have taken a heavy toll on the housing and construction market, with mid-cap builders Galliford (L: ) among those first in the firing line.

Its shares added 3.1%, among top risers on the mid-cap index on Wednesday, after it forecast annual pretax profit in line with analysts' estimates, a sign it was managing to ride out the worst of a downturn in housing sales and prices.

Luxury brand Burberry (L: ) rose another 3% and scaled a record high following a slew of rating upgrades, a day after posting its biggest one-day gain on the back of robust first-quarter sales.

Among smallcaps, Saga (L: ) surged 14% after activist investor Elliott revealed a stake in the tourism and insurance firm, less than a month after it flagged concerns around its tours business.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/oil-majors-fresnillo-drag-ftse-lower-1918354,0.051,0.874,0.075,0.9086

Prudential (LSE: LON: ) has been one of the FTSE 100’s outstanding performers in 2019. Up 25% since the fireworks ushered in New Year’s Day, it seems as if market makers are quite unperturbed about signs of economic cooling in the company’s core Asian territories.

Investors are quite right to be so bullish as the insurer has all the tools to keep on thriving. Last year wasn’t exactly a cakewalk for consumers in Asia, yet Prudential still saw new business profit booming 14% in 2018 to £2.6bn, a result that paid testament to the efforts it has undertaken to bolster its multichannel proposition and effectively develop its product ranges to match the needs of its foreign customers.

It’s impossible to overestimate just how big Prudential’s future market opportunities are, given the rate at which populations are increasing and wealth levels booming in Asian nations. Recent research from McKinsey Global Institute suggests that the continent will account for 50% of global GDP by 2040 and Prudential is setting itself up to exploit these demographic and economic changes.

In the meantime, I’m tipping this dividend growth star to deliver another splendid update when half-year financials are released on August 14. And I reckon its dirt-cheap share price, as illustrated by a rock-bottom forward P/E multiple of 11.2 times, leaves scope for a fresh buying frenzy in the aftermath.

The oilies might shine Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) (LSE: RDSB) and BP (LSE: LON: ) are another couple of big-yielders from the whose share prices could detonate in the weeks ahead.

prices have fallen under $70 and continued falling until they reached critical technical levels around $60. The fact that they didn’t fall below this level bodes well for prices looking ahead, what with the Iran crisis escalating. Indeed, the worsening diplomatic crisis between Iran and the West suggests that black gold values could resume their upward path sooner rather than later as both sides step up their icy rhetoric and the US and UK bolster their military presence in the Gulf.

Investors in the blue-chip oilies could also point to recent supply-side data as reasons to be optimistic in August. Fears over abundant shale production from the US have died back a bit in recent weeks as the rig count has fallen, the number of units in operation now sitting at their lowest since February 2018. This trend is not the only reason for them to cheer though, as inventory data from the States has also been more promising of late.

But are they buys? So would I buy into the likes of BP and Shell? Not on your nelly. Even if their share prices do gain additional ground in August, the threat of surging supply in the medium-to-long-term still makes them a risk too far in my eyes.

And one further thing: any support afforded to oil prices by the escalating Iranian crisis next month could easily be unwound should extra sets of weaker economic data come in from the US, Europe and China and raise concerns about the global economy. I’m more than happy to ignore their forward dividend yields of around 6% and invest elsewhere.

LONDON (Reuters) - Climate-change activists Extinction Rebellion have been banned from using their trademark boats in the last of a series of Summer protests on Friday.

The boats - repainted and pulled around on trailers - have become a symbol of the group's demonstrations and were used to stop traffic in five British cities this week as part of a “summer uprising.” In April, a pink boat was used to block major roads and cause traffic chaos around Oxford Circus junction in central London.

Police warned on Thursday that the April protests were unacceptable and they would not tolerate that level of disruption again.

“We need to balance [their right to protest] with the rights of those wishing to go about their daily lives and action will be taken against those who choose to ignore this condition and/or break the law,” said Commander Jane Connors.

Police said the boats would be banned for Friday's demos, which began with a protest at the construction site of London’s 4.2 billion-pound super-sewer project.

Extinction Rebellion says it wants to cause even greater disruption in October than it did in April, when protests included stopping trains and defacing offices of oil major Shell (LON: ).

It aims to use non-violent civil disobedience to force governments to cut carbon emissions more quickly.",https://uk.investing.com//news/world-news/uk-ecoactivists-banned-from-using-boats-in-street-protests-1920565,0.17,0.801,0.029,-0.9826
